Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m always proud to represent United Rentals on these calls, but today as a special significance for me. Our company will turn 20 years old this year and it\u2019s been quite a journey so far and our best years are still ahead of us. So it\u2019s fitting that we start the next 20 years with a major announcement to acquire NES Rentals, one of the ten largest equipment rental companies in North America. I\u2019m not going to reiterate everything you saw in the release, because I want to leave time for your questions, but I want to emphasize how favorably we view this deal.", "Both as an attractive use of capital and also as an investment that\u2019s in lockstep with our strategy for profitable growth, our core business, our culture and our people. With NES, we\u2019re gaining a great group of people who share our intense focus on customer service. And when we\u2019re working side by side throughout the integration to capitalize on the best in class expertise from both sides. And we look forward to giving our new employees even more opportunities as part of our larger organization. I also want to mention that we\u2019re in a \u2013 where is our own toughest customer when it comes to M&A. We look at a lot of proposals and pursue very few of them and acquisition has to make sense at every level. In this case, we\u2019re buying NES and an attractive multiple using available cash and borrowing capacity and gaining broad based accretion to earnings, revenue, EBITDA in free cash flow.", "In addition, the strategic rationale is compelling. While NES serves the same construction in industrial markets that we do, their footprint customer base in fleet a commentary to what in many respects. For an example NES has extensive relationships with local and strategic accounts. This will help diversify our customer base and this nicely with our go to market strategy. It should also accelerate the cross selling of our services including our specialty fleet. And the timing is ideal to take advantage of an expanding marketplace. We\u2019ve also identified meaningful synergies that will be pursuing to integration. Some of this with the natural outcome of combination, of others like purchasing efficiencies that will come to scale. So this investment can be characterized as the right assets, right timing, right people, right place and the right price.", "In the middle, I\u2019ll talk more about our operating environment, but I first want to summarize 2016 and the performance of our current operations. Our financial results and our view of the cycle are both important narratives today. The NES acquisition while important for other reasons to be seen as the latest execution of our ongoing strategy for value creation. So starting with the fourth quarter, we were very pleased with the way our business performed. Rental revenue, OEC on rent, and time utilization, all increased versus year-ago. And while rates continue to lag that are well within our projected range. On a monthly sequential basis, we gain momentum going to 2017, and our OEC on rent was particularly strong through December.", "Turning to the full year, we delivered solid results in the year that has share of headwinds, starting with the global economic concerns in the first quarter and then ongoing drags from upstream oil and gas or weak Canadian economy and industry over fleeting.", "Despite these constraints, we exceeded the upper band of our guidance on total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. In fact, the $1.18 billion of free cash flow we generated was a record for us. Our results in 2016 were driven by a combination of positive internal and external dynamics.", "The internal push came in a large part from our strategic approach the business development. For example, we signed new customers and targeted verticals. We grew our specialty operations and employed a surgical use of CapEx to expand our fleet, all while maintaining cost discipline. The external pool came from broad-based demand across geographies and project types led by commercial construction.", "And we are pleased to see our confidence in the cycle reflected in the market behavior. And we believe the cycle remains intact and that demand will continue to trend up in 2017. In the U.S., there\u2019s obvious from industry optimism about the focus of the new administration. In our opinion, it\u2019s too early to call. It\u2019s a government spending stimulates construction it will be incremental to a cycle that we already see as positive for our business.", "I want to give you a quick rundown of the four additional factors we considered and formulating our view. First, there are number of favorable U.S. indicators of 2017, including the Dodge construction outlook, contractor backlogs, national surveys by key trade groups, and importantly CEO confidence surveys. These are the people making spending decisions to create jobs for our customers.", "IHS market, our industry\u2019s primary forecasting firm, projects 3% to 4% growth for the U.S. rental industry this year. Second, there \u2013 appears to be on more of a balance between supply and demand. If rental companies continue to show discipline with CapEx spending, the absorption rate for excess fleet should accelerate. Until then, we expect to see more of our growth come from volume other than rate.", "Third, customer surveys in the quarter showed a positive trend. More than half of the respondents cited an improving outlook for 2017, while only 5% pointed to a declining outlook. And at the same time, U.S. consumers\u2019, home builders, and small businesses reported higher confidence levels in December. So there\u2019s no disconnect here.", "And fourth, we have the benefit of almost 900 branches with connections to hundreds of local markets. This gives us an ongoing access that industries largest volume of empirical data, operating information and customer touch points. More immediately, our fourth quarter results reflected a healthy level of demand. We increased our average daily OEC on rate year-over-year in a majority of the states and provinces where we operate.", "In the U.S., the coastal states continue to outpace the country as a whole. This is particularly true in the Southeast. Our double-digit revenue growth was driven by commercial construction of warehousing, data centers, and mixed use facilities. Further up the coast we\u2019re on a casino project, power plants, as well as the major airport expansion.", "Out west, we saw nearly $7 billion of large multi-year projects start up in California last quarter, with Washington, Oregon, and Arizona expected to follow suit by March. These range from stadiums and transit projects to healthcare, solar, automotive, and corporate campuses. And we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that Canada has turned the corner. The fourth quarter marked a first uptick in oil and gas activity in Canada since 2014.", "And GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 2% this year aided in part by the rebalanced commodity prices. Our specialty segment continued to outperform in the quarter, rental revenue for Trench, Power and Pump increased by approximately 5%, 17% and 10% respectively from the prior year. We opened a total of 14 specialty branches in 2016 and plan to open another 17 this year. As we said in our Investor Day, our long-term goal remains to grow our specialty business to $2 billion of revenue.", "Now in 2016, the bulk of specialties top line growth came from same-store performance. This was driven by standalone demand for the services and by cross-selling our specialty fleet to our general rental customers. Cross-selling remains an important part of our company wide plan to cement customer loyalty and boost return on assets. In 2016, we generated 13% more revenue from cross-selling our fleet to national accounts versus the prior year. And with NES on board, well thousands of new customers that can use our services.", "So to circle back what I said earlier, we believe that this is a critical year in terms of timing. In addition to expanding to M&A and our specialty cold starts will be funding a series of exciting initiatives to enhance the long-term earning power of the business. We announced this on Investor Day in December under the name Project XL. Executing this plan now, we believe, we can capitalize more fully on the cycle and realize attractive dividends for years to come.", "One area of investment is technology, we\u2019ll be expanding our digital strategy and our total control fleet management software to create more of a competitive mode. And we\u2019ll continue to explore new verticals that offer potential synergies with our existing customer base. This year we\u2019ll spend about $200 million more of CapEx versus 2016 based on current operations in part to serve different types of customers and markets associated with these initiatives.", "And we\u2019re focusing on aspects of the business that are within our control with the potential to permanently enhance our industry position and future profitability. These growth investments are baked into our guidance, we issued for 2017 and once we complete the purchase of NES we\u2019ll issue new guidance for the combined operation.", "So this is where we start to narrative for 2017 at the threshold of our next 20 years. Poised to capitalize on a healthy marketplace with an exciting acquisition on our doorstep and laser focus on opportunities. The agility to adjust to sudden changes and the experience to act not just as stewards of United Rentals but as catalyst for growth.", "So with that, I\u2019ll ask Bill to cover the quarter and recap the year. And then we\u2019ll take your questions. Over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone. My comments this morning, I\u2019ll skinny down a little bit the commentary on Q4 and the year, so that we have a little time to talk about the NES transaction as well as our outlook for the year.", "So let me start as always with the rental revenue in the quarter. Rental revenue was up 1.6% over the prior year or about $20 million of total change. Within that re-rent and ancillary, we\u2019re basically flat with last year. So the change was really in owned equipment revenue, volume was the major positive there, OEC on rent was up nicely in the quarter 4.3% that accounted for about $47 million of year-over-year rental revenue change.", "Rate was the big headwind there, down 1.8% year-over-year for the quarter accounted for about $20 million of reduction versus last year. On the CapEx inflation front usual 1.5% or so, of a headwind there, that\u2019s about $17 billion of reduction versus last year. And then mix in other accumulates all the other impacts within that a number of different cross currents. One is the fact that the holidays fell on maybe a little bit of a fortunate part of the week, with Christmas and New Year\u2019s on Sunday\u2019s this year as oppose to Friday\u2019s the year before they hit us less than the last year in terms of what we see on rent during the work week.", "So put it all together, that mix and another number was about $11 million positive versus last year. And that adds up the $20 million year-over-year change in rental revenue. There was no real currency impact in rental revenue for the quarter. The Canadian dollar was not significantly different this year than it was last year.", "As speaking of Canada, it still remains somewhat of a headwind on a year-over-year basis. Rental revenue in Canada was down double digits, if you excluded that the U.S. only portion of our rental revenue was up 2.9% that compares to the 1.6% that we reported for the whole company. And that, that impact in Canada is basically the carryover from the decline that we\u2019ve been talking to in Canada for the last year plus.", "This real briefly on used equipment sales down $22 million in proceeds from U.S sales year-over-year down to $135 million and that primarily flex. The smaller amount of OEC on rent that we sold this year compared to last year. The margin and price performance of our used sales were nice improvements over last year. Margin at \u2013 adjusted margin at 49.6%, 3.1 percentage points higher reflects nice price performance.", "In fact, if you look at our proceeds as a percent of OEC, we realized 53.4% of the original cost back through used equipment proceeds that 60 basis points better than it was last year and reflects a pricing environment, which has turned more positive over the last number of months. So we\u2019re encouraged by not only what that sales were used sales proceeds, but also what it might say about the direction of demand in the marketplace.", "On adjusted EBITDA going through the bridge there $749 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. That\u2019s $5 million better than last year and 49.2% margin, which is 30 basis points better. Volume accounted for $32 million of improvement over last year and then rental rates went against that for about $19 million of declined reflecting the volume and rate environment that we talked about previously.", "Fleet inflation was also a headwind down $12 million year-over-year and used sales, the $5 million declined in used sales profit was a contributor of headwind. A merit impact was the usual roughly $5 million this year and the bonus accrual was also a headwind in the quarter kind of for about $10 million of decline versus last year. When you look at the rest the remaining $24 million is a combination of other cost improvements across the wide variety of cost items and they reflect the impact primarily of our focus on cost through our lean initiatives and other areas. So lumping the cost improvements together including bad debt improvements the little bit of an assurance reserve adjustment and other cost saves the total to about $16 million of improvement versus last year and then that leaves $8 million or so of mix and other.", "Regarding our lean savings and other EBITDA improvement initiatives, we had been targeting as you all know the $100 million run rate of improvement by the end of 2016, pleased to say that we actually ended the year with a run rate of $110 million on that program. So it continues to reflect the effort of a lot of people really focusing on all of our processes across the company to drive improvement. And needless to say that focus will continue. We\u2019ve got a new energized set of initiatives that are part of the Project XL projects that Mike mentioned and we\u2019ll continue to report on progress on those initiatives as we go forward.", "One of the standout measures for our quarter this year was free cash flow $1.182 as Mike said is a record, that $260 million improvement year-over-year roughly really reflects the impact of a couple of key items obviously it was benefited by the reduction in CapEx, but there were benefits in a number of different areas. So it was a very robust free cash flow result and helped us drive a significant reduction in our net debt. Net debt at the end of the year was down $500 million versus the prior year about 6% and it\u2019s very importantly reflected the impact of our free cash flow. That in fact includes the impact of our share repurchase on the year, which was a total of $517 million in the year.", "Speaking of the share repurchase we are in the quarter spend about $40 million to bring that year-to-date program up to 517. And if you look at the program to date number its $627 million, so little over $370 million remains on the program as you all saw during the earnings release. We paused purchases under the program that $40 of purchases happened in the month of October, and obviously we paused as we were considering actually several acquisitions in addition to the NES acquisition that we\u2019ve announced.", "As we complete the NES acquisition, as we start down and get deep into the integration. Our plan is to we evaluate where we are and how we want to approach the share repurchase program. Our intend is to continue to complete the program, but we feel it\u2019s prudent to re-evaluate where we are, see how the cash flow is shaping up as we get later in the year. And then make a separate decision about, when and how quickly we go back at the share repurchase program. So stay tuned on that front.", "We did finish with significant liquidity as we always do at the end of the quarter, $1.2 billion in total liquidity and that includes just little over $800 million of ABL capacity and a little over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet.", "Just real quickly on the capital structure, you\u2019ve all seen the redemptions and new issuance that we\u2019ve done throughout the course of the year in service of the capital structure, just to call out one specific number of the impact of that going forward. We expect that along with the redemptions and restructuring and the reduction in debt that it will have a significant positive impact on our cash interest expense for next year. So we are expecting a reduction in cash interest of about $65 million in 2017 compared to 2016.", "Last two points, the outlook and the NES transactions and then we will get to Q&A. On the outlook, you saw the numbers, I don\u2019t feel compelled to repeat them just a couple of points. First, we have said this before but just to reiterate the outlook removes this time rate and time utilization guidance and that\u2019s consistent with the philosophy that we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of quarters.", "I will note that the EBITDA range that we gave, just to highlight does include some operating expense investments in support of some of the Project XL initiatives that we\u2019ve touched on in other areas, as well as other focused areas like our improvement in digital and marketing efforts and so forth.", "On free cash flow the $650 million to $750 million range there reflects an increase in cash taxes that we\u2019ve been talking about for some time now. We expect 2017 cash tax is to be higher by about $260 million versus 2016, and when you combine that increase with the outflow for roughly $200 million more of CapEx. Those are the two significant drivers of our outlook for free cash flow coming down from the $1.182 billion this year to the $650 million to $750 million range for 2017.", "We also will benefit from the cash interest reduction that I just pointed out, but working against that are the net operating profitability and working capital adjustment. So when you add all that up, you get to our outlook of $650 million to $750 million on free cash flow. The one other point I\u2019ll make on the outlook is that, again, I think we said this in the releases, but none of those numbers include the impact of NES, our plan is to provide combined company guidance for the remainder of the year at the point where we close NES. So stay tuned for that.", "Further on NES, Mike hit the key points, but just to reiterate we think that the impact of NES with the customers that they bring the additional scale that it means for us. The improvement in the density of our network in certain key markets, the cross sell opportunities all are very key parts of the strategic rationale for doing this deal.", "And then you set those alongside the cost synergies and the tax benefits and it makes we\u2019re very powerful financial view of the deal as well. But the cost synergies we are calling out is about $40 million, roughly $30 million of that number is from good old fashioned straight ahead corporate overhead and other sort of obvious operating efficiencies. The remainder is due to operational efficiencies that require a little bit more change in process and analysis before we can call out it specifically where they will come from. But based on our experience with RSC and other acquisitions we\u2019re very confident that the $40 million total of operating cost is very achievable synergy result.", "When you synergies their EBITDA, there are $155 million of EBITDA from last year by the $40 million just to get a measure of the overall value of this deal. That $965 million purchase price divided by that synergised EBITDA comes down to a 4.9 times multiple that\u2019s pretty attractive by almost any standard, especially when you consider the multiple that we are trading at today.", "When you further add in the effect of that tax benefit, which we calculate as a present value of about $125 million that brings the adjusted purchase price multiple down to 4.3 times. That\u2019s very attractive and that shows in the return profile of this acquisition. We expect that from an ROIC perspective it\u2019s going to be ROIC above our cost of capital very quickly in fact within 18 months. And that return perspective is also very powerful if you look at the internal rates of return as another way of thinking about returns.", "So the financial characteristics of this deal are very attractive alongside the strategic rationale that we touched on before. Just regarding our financing plan the $965 million purchase price will be paid in all cash. And our intention is to draw a portion of that purchase price from our ABL and the remainder will go into a new underwritten debt issue. We haven\u2019t yet decided exactly how we might approach either, either the amount of the ABL draw, or whether we\u2019ll issue a new debt issue or reopen an existing issue. So more to come as we get a little bit more in-depth and get closer to close on that transaction.", "Regarding timing, our expectation is that the deal will close in the early part of the second quarter. And obviously that will be driven by getting through certain key milestones like Hart-Scott-Rodino approval. But we don\u2019t see any issue with HSR it\u2019s just a matter of when the timing will come. So for modelling purpose as we\u2019ve been thinking about it as an April, 1 close obviously if we get to the point of closing earlier, we will do that. But for modelling purposes that\u2019s a reasonable place to start.", "So that\u2019s enough of you guys listening to me. Let\u2019s get to Q&A. And hopefully we\u2019ll be able to address any questions that you have, so operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. [Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research. Your question please?", "Neil Frohnapple", "Hi, guys.", "William Plummer", "Hi, Neil.", "Neil Frohnapple", "I believe the implied incremental margin on the midpoint to the sales and EBITDA guidance is around 18% for 2017. And I think you mentioned operating expenses higher to support Project XL. But are there any other notable headwinds on 2017 EBITDA such as incentive comp or \u2013 should I not read too much than the calculations since this based on a fairly small revenue change.", "William Plummer", "Yes, I think it\u2019s an important point that you\u2019ve made right at the end there, it is a small revenue change and so the exact percent that you calculate, you can\u2019t go too far with. But that said, you do have to remember that we do have incremental expenses like normalizing our bonus payout that\u2019s a $27 million impact year-over-year. If we end up paying out 100% in 2017 compared to where we paid out in 2016.", "So pretty significant headwind and you certainly need to keep that in mind, of course, on a year-over-year basis we always have our usual suspect like merit increases, merit accounts or something like $23 million to $25 million of headwind year-over-year as well. So you got to keep that in mind. And then we\u2019ve got the usual inflation on the other lines of cost that we will run hard to offset with the savings and the initiatives from Project XL beyond going mean initiatives and so forth. So those are couple of key things that I would throughout Neil.", "Neil Frohnapple", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then what\u2019s your first blush on NES rentals fleet mix composition including class, age et cetera. I mean we will require a period of higher CapEx to improve their fleet mix. And it does look like their more crane exposure to some larger type cranes like rough train. So this is an opportunity longer-term for United to expand more into yours, more or likely that you guys would deemphasize our products over time. Thank you.", "Matt Flannery", "Thanks, Neil. This is Matt. So the fleet age is a good question and we\u2019re going to find out whether that\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t necessarily go to the point saying that, that\u2019s going to require CapEx. They as a competitor NES is very good customer service and very good customer retention. So we\u2019re going to learn how they have wage that fleet while keeping R&M at a reasonable cost and maybe we\u2019ll learn something there. It is primarily an aerial fleet and we\u2019ve always known if you can [indiscernible] aerial when you need to, but there may be some other trick that\u2019s the great part of all of our acquisitions as we always learn something new from the new team members that we bring on board. As far as the cranes, the cranes is a mix of some cranes that we\u2019re very familiar with like some of the industrial cranes with Broderson Cranes that we use a lot in steel mills and car plant. And they do have some cranes that are not as compatible with our fleet.", "They\u2019re isolated in a few markets and with a couple of customers who are very familiar with. I won\u2019t go as for yet is to say we may grow that in our \u2013 in further in our footprint. But we certainly once again have the opportunity to learn. I think it\u2019s important to note that just about all their cranes are bare rentals, which place pretty well for us. So we probably have a little bit of a concern if they were all mean to rentals. So I think it\u2019s an opportunity once again for us to learn about potential new offerings", "Neil Frohnapple", "Great. Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey George.", "George Tong", "Hi, thanks, good morning. You are targeting costs synergies of about $40 million associated with the NES transaction, a big part of that is coming from operations and operational efficiency, based on your due diligence can you elaborate on the sources of savings, potential savings from operations at NES and also how much potential rental CapEx savings you can generate.", "William Plummer", "Yes. Hey George, it\u2019s Bill. So what I would say is the operational efficiencies are going to come out of just really diving deeper into their processes as well as our processes and looking for ways to improve those processes based on what either side has learned over time. The way I think about it sort of accrued way, they\u2019re operating at about a 42% EBITDA margin, we\u2019re operating at about 48% EBITDA margin. So that GAAP says that we\u2019re doing something that that they are not. Now whether they can do what we can do or not, we\u2019ll find out more detail, but I think as we look deeper into how they do things and how we do things, we\u2019re going to find ways to close that GAAP somewhat.", "And it\u2019s just going to take some time to get to. Regarding other savings, purchasing savings certainly are an opportunity for us I think you saw in the investor deck for the deal that we think that we can find some procurement savings just right off the back just given the greater scale that we have for fleet purchases compared to where we see them. So that\u2019s going to be cash save and we\u2019ll show up immediately release then in operating expenses, but cash save that adds to the value of this deal. So we\u2019ll be looking for other opportunities in addition to the fleet purchases to leverage that aspect as well.", "George Tong", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly the year-over-year improvement in time utilization stepped up pretty meaningfully in December, time it was up and 1.7% in December compared to up 28% October and 0.9% in November. The holidays falling on a weekend was a factor, but can you elaborate on how the strength in rental demand changed as you moved through the quarter?", "William Plummer", "Yes. It really that it \u2013 so you got the profile. I\u2019d say the utilization profile probably mirrors the OEC on rent profile right. So it step-up and you\u2019re right, December was helped by Christmas on a weekend, but that wasn\u2019t the entire story for the month of December. And I\u2019ll let Matt talk about specific areas of demand that we saw, but there was a general move higher as we saw little bit more activity just kind of build as we went through the quarter.", "George Tong", "Anything you want add?", "Matt Flannery", "No. I think Bill covered it, but to reiterate the demand was a bigger driver than just the holiday on weekend and that has been encouraging for us. We didn\u2019t have the drop that we haven\u2019t Thanksgiving as large as we\u2019ve had past years that was encouraging for us. So there are a lot of good things for us and I think, you hear that and see that in our guidance going into 2017.", "George Tong", "Very helpful, thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, George. I think I told a couple of folks that December was 180 basis points year-over-year as 170 is the right number. Thanks for remind me that George.", "George Tong", "Of course, thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes in of Seth Weber from RBC Capital. Your question please.", "Brendon", "Hi, this is Brendon on for Seth. Touching on the oil and gas markets, I was wondering if there was any kind of additional color on metrics that you could provide for a performance in the quarter. And then if you are seeing any kind of revamp in activity and if you are aware?", "William Plummer", "Sure, Brendon. We\u2019ve seen some incremental improvement that would be similar to what you see in the rig count, maybe a little bit less, but I think the important point to know is that this point, the upstream is only a little over 2% of our overall revenue. So if we see a 14%, 15% improvement will \u2013 they\u2019ll have some impact on how much of improvement you are going to see and is it meaningful in the overall organization.", "That being said, if you add in the Canadian part of the business, which gets categorized a little bit in the non-drilling in the midstream, that\u2019s another percent of our business brings the total up to three and some improvement up there would really help the team up in Western Canada. We haven\u2019t seen that yet, most of the improvements in the second part of your question has been out in the Permian and mostly in the drills in the U.S., but not so much in Western Canada yet and we are positioned for when we get tail.", "Brendon", "Okay, great. And then your guidance from the 1.4% to 1.5% growth CapEx, how are you thinking that between \u2013 splitting that between specialty and gen rent and then does the new deal do anything to slow specialty branch openings.", "Michael Kneeland", "On the latter part of your question absolutely not, we are still targeting 14 cold starts and specialty and actually this new customer base that we are gaining from the NES acquisition, we think and enhance our opportunity to cross sell and I think you saw that in the notes that we had. Additionally, I\u2019m sorry, I think I said 14 \u2013 we had 14 this year and 17 planned for 2017. Additionally, when we think about how we are going to spend the CapEx, specialty is still a top priority.", "That seems not only is a very accretive when we grow that business, but they continue to show the ability to grow that business. So that will be a primary source of funding and then Bill touched earlier on the investments we want to make in Project XL and I think that a lot of the rest part CapEx will be to support getting into new verticals, such as continuing to grow our infrastructure business. That might take some unique product, some new product that we think have some great opportunity or the entertainment vertical and while the list could go on, but we do see an opportunity to broaden even our gen rent fleet or non-specialty fleet.", "Brendon", "Okay thanks. That\u2019s it from me.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.", "Steven Ramsey", "Hi guys, this is Steven Ramsey on for Nick.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi.", "Steven Ramsey", "Can you talk about NES time utilization and rate trajectory in the past couple of years and how they would compare to you guys?", "William Plummer", "So I think if you \u2013 we put some revenue NES revenue information in the Investor Day, I don\u2019t remember if we put fleet. I\u2019m just trying to give you some external data that maybe can point you in the right direction. It\u2019s clear that what I\u2019d say on rate is that \u2013 we know that United Rentals is a premium rate company relative to the marketplace. We\u2019ve seen that through a lot of different data sources.", "And so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that our rate performance if you measured by dollar utilization for example is higher than NES. I think that\u2019s about as far as I\u2019d go on that front. On time utilization they are a aerial, a heavy fleet and so it\u2019s hard to compare directly their time utilization experience with ours. They\u2019ve done a nice job in getting their fleet on rent and keeping utilizations attractive. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re pleased to see. And we want to make sure that we can support that if not enhance that going forward. So those are the comments that I offer. Matt or Mike, I don\u2019t know, if you guys would want to add anything else.", "Matt Flannery", "No, I think\u2026", "Michael Kneeland", "No, I think you covered.", "Steven Ramsey", "Excellent. And then on the regional color, you provided which was helpful. Is there a much of a discrepancy and this is for core United. Is there a much of a discrepancy in rates by region of the United States?", "Matt Flannery", "We haven\u2019t gone into that before Steven. I mean there is some discrepancy I would say that the band has tightened over the years. That there\u2019s the big outlier used to be Western Canada. That\u2019s no long, you\u2019ve seen the Canadian rate experience. So that\u2019s tightened up, I think the oil and gas high rate market as we\u2019ve discussed before as part of our headwind. That\u2019s tightening the band overall. And as there is not larger variances there used to be we haven\u2019t discussed in detail but you can imagine the balance of rate and time is what everybody runs in the rental industry. So that is your \u2013 if you\u2019re in severe cold weather markets, you\u2019re going to need to end up in a little bit more rate because your time opportunity is lower, but not anything that I\u2019d call out on the call.", "Steven Ramsey", "Excellent. Thank you, guys.", "William Plummer", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your question please.", "Ross Gilardi", "Good morning. Thanks guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey.", "William Plummer", "Hey, Ross.", "Ross Gilardi", "Hey, I\u2019m sorry if I missed some of this because we\u2019re just jumping between calls. I mean you say that in upfront but clearly\u2026", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, we do hearing\u2026", "Ross Gilardi", "Yes, think I guess. I think it\u2019s a good time. It\u2019s a hard time to have a conference call. But look clearly you guys are very excited about your business right now, lots of optimism on the future. But I guess when I look at it you\u2019re still guiding the flattish EBITDA at the midpoint. So like are you seeing any genuine acceleration in your business yet or we still kind of at this plateau. I\u2019m trying to understand, what the offsetting factors are here, because you guys saw clearly plenty of growth opportunities that you\u2019re excited about?", "William Plummer", "I think we can say, we\u2019ve seen genuine acceleration as we talked about in fourth quarter in the overall demand. And if you dig a little deeper into that demand growth, you can point to new projects that have kicked off or that are ramping up. That we expect will continue into 2017. So that gives us encouragement that\u2019s one of the reasons why we put more CapEx into the plan for this year. For example, so on that regard. Yes, we think that there\u2019s genuine acceleration going out there from a demand perspective. How quickly that translates into top line growth and profitability growth is part of the question that we wrestle with at this time in the year.", "But we think we captured that wrestling in the ranges that we\u2019ve given in our guidance. So I would say don\u2019t just fixate on the midpoint. Think about the full range that we gave you because we think the full range is reflective of that momentum and how it could play out as we go forward.", "Michael Kneeland", "And this is Mike. The only thing I would add to that is \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if you attended our conference in December, Investor Day. But we laid out a very detailed strategy. And that is what we\u2019re following. We understand the industry. We understand the demand factors as Bill mentioned. You know the easiest thing we can do is add capital. But we have a very, very rigorous plan of how we think about things and how we\u2019re going to execute it.", "And that\u2019s where the capital is going to go. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to apply it. We tried to point out the discipline that we\u2019ve put in play are in CapEx last year by increasing the contribution margin, by changing what we\u2019re investing in. And that\u2019s the message I would say as we go forward. Bill is exactly right. We gave a range and that range \u2013 is one that we think is comparison to where the market is and how we see the world.", "Ross Gilardi", "Got it. Thanks guys. And then just question on incremental margins going forward. I mean obviously I can see what you\u2019ve laid out there for 2017 and it\u2019s a pretty type range. But how should we think more broadly about incremental. I mean in the good old days when you guys were raising prices like 3%, 4% a year you had this steady incremental EBITDA flow through like 60% plus. I guess and just like more broadly in an environment where demands up a little bit, your growing fleet 4%, 5% in pricings kind of moving sideways. What kind of incremental margin with that sort of translate into on your view?", "Michael Kneeland", "It makes a little bit more challenging to hit that 60%. I think the wildcard question is how much can some of the Project XL initiatives and sort of the building momentum on our Lean and other cost focus initiatives. How much do those support the flow through that we might otherwise experience. So a hard question, I answer without getting into too many specifics, but what I\u2019d say is if we got to a level of revenue growth that was sort of larger right to get away from the calculation challenge of small levels of revenue growth.", "Ross Gilardi", "Right.", "Michael Kneeland", "I\u2019d like to feel that the initiatives that we\u2019ve got going in the business would keep us around that 60% flow through kind of area. So keep asking that question as we go forward and get a little bit more revenue growth going, but if I remodeling flow through I just start there at least and then build some sensitivities around it.", "Ross Gilardi", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.", "William Plummer", "Yes, thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Pfeffer from Avondale Partners. Your question please.", "Larry Pfeffer", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, good morning.", "William Plummer", "Good morning.", "Larry Pfeffer", "So into your point on, you wish went through on kind of the acceleration is some of the increased CapEx in gen rent going to opportunities that maybe you weren\u2019t able to serve last year.", "William Plummer", "Yes. I think that\u2019s fair, right. I think we climb down pretty hard on CapEx in 2016. And there were certainly numerous cases. I know because every time I went out in the field people accosted me about capital. Numerous cases we\u2019re focused on that, it would be a good idea to invest more capital to go after some of the business that we just couldn\u2019t when we were constraining capital. So if you read that constrain a little bit then you can get that business and you can support the initiatives under Project XL and some of the verticals that we\u2019re going after as Matt mentioned. And so that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish with a little bit more capital in 2017.", "Larry Pfeffer", "Got you. And then just on the acquisition front obviously large deal here with NES. How does that change your thinking if it all on kind of the pipeline as we move through 2017?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. We always have a pipeline. I think that as Bill went through his opening comments, he talked about how our trend \u2013 in the transaction, how we think about our M&A strategy. First start strategically, I mean look at the financial aspects, and then cultural is also another one. It\u2019s very important to learn. This one here happens ahead all of them. And there are numerous deals that we have looked at and we just continue on, they will make the card. And that\u2019s how we \u2013 that\u2019s the discipline in rigor that we put in play. We have a pretty high bar and that\u2019s not going to change. So if they hit all three of those buckets then we are very interested, but much beyond that we have the disciplined at to walk from.", "William Plummer", "And the capacity if we do find one that lines up right, this deal will only take us to little under three times leverage right at the close, by the end of the year that leverage is going to come down, depending on what we end up doing with the share repurchase for example to nicely below three times. So we\u2019ll be in a position where of another deal lines up and it\u2019s available later this year. We\u2019re ready to go.", "Larry Pfeffer", "Got you. Thanks for taking my questions guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes.", "William Plummer", "Right. Thanks, Larry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please.", "Joe Box", "Hey guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey Joe.", "William Plummer", "Hey Joe.", "Joe Box", "So Mike over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve talked about steering the company toward higher returning items like specialty. I know you\u2019ve left the door open for really any deal, but maybe if you could just highlight the top one or two things that really made you comfortable with going with a big gen rent deal.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well. Joe I think I just outlined transaction with NES I think is a way of looking at it strategically. And as you think about it, when I will just check \u2013 go through the check list. It accesses to new customers. It supports growth in attractive markets. And enhances that cross selling that specialty side of the business. And we give market density. From our financial, as Bill outlined, we get growth returns free cash flow without significantly impacting our leverage to getting a cost synergies.", "And then the cultural aspect of when [indiscernible] going back strategically as Matt mentioned, and here\u2019s a company that as older assets, but their churncustomer was relatively low, which is peaks volume about how they focus on the customer. That along with safety is something that both of those items are a part of the United Rentals\u2019 culture.", "So those are things that we look at and those are the things, how we would look at all every one of these. From a timing perspective, you talk about large one. We have to look at leverage. And those are all the components that now we look at and again I can only tell you that we have the courage not to new deals.", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, just from the finance section of this room the tax benefit is no small thing as well. That\u2019s very important value for us as we move into being a pull cash tax payer to be able to realize that $125 million present value, with a pretty high certainty is pretty attractive. So just one more piece of that puzzle that Mike just step through the said a lot of things lined up to make this deal attractive.", "Joe Box", "Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe switching gears, can you guys just give us a feel for maybe how the OEC on rent or the rental rate trajectory seems to be looking into January? I guess I just want to be cognizant of the favorable weather that we saw in 4Q and the timing in the holiday relative to what seems like could be a ramp in overall activity.", "William Plummer", "Yes, Joe. So to be consistent with our approach have not giving guidance or going into too much debt about rate and time utilization, I won\u2019t answer that question directly, all update is that we\u2019ve giving you the guidance for the full year, we haven\u2019t seen anything that would cause us to change that guidance, obviously, because we just gave the last night. So that as far as would ready to go and comment about January.", "Joe Box", "Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.", "William Plummer", "Thank Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Jerry Revich. I know that you won\u2019t comment on pricing and better than in your guidance. But can you way on in your view that is broader pricing cycle, we\u2019ve had a positive about past years. But with your CapEx announcement should that be an indication that you expect for market to return to pricing growths.", "William Plummer", "I won\u2019t directly address pricing other than to say that I do believe \u2013 we do believe that there is a very good argument that the overall cycle is in good shape. And will continue on and upward path for some time to come, whether that manifest itself in rates going back up and sort of the 4%, 5%, 6% a year kind of frame that they did. Earlier in this recovery I leave it to you to put your own estimate on that. But the cycle has legs to go is our view. And so that will support demand and depending on, how the market dynamics respond to that demand, it will have an impact on where rates go.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, and then as you evaluate the NES business model. Can you talk about what you see as the drivers for there, lower dollar utilization and EBITDA to OEC. And then like how much of that GAAP is operational verse requiring equipment refresh to read this might spending?", "Matt Flannery", "So I would this is Matt, I would say that it\u2019s probably when you compare it to our overall dollar utilization. The first of significant driver is the fleet next. So they are primarily an aerial company at doesn\u2019t bring even for us as high dollar utilization as our average, but also doesn\u2019t bring the cost associated with it. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us that help bolster their dollar utilization through our processes and by serving additional products to their customers. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we think we\u2019re a good owner for that business.", "As far as their fleet age, I don\u2019t think that really plays too much into the dollar utilization it may add some incremental cost. But we feel when we put these two companies together in some of these markets we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to get a better net return than we get today.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And one more if I can. On RSC you reduced cost by 16% of the acquired company sales. Here you\u2019re implying that 11% of EMEA sales, what\u2019s driving that difference and is that maybe something just being a little conservative.", "Matt Flannery", "Other than the fact that we\u2019re buying both companies they don\u2019t have that many similarities. RSC was a public company had a lot more overhead costs that we could \u2013 that we\u2019re duplicative immediately. So that was a big driver. At the time of the RSC acquisition a lot of the savings were driven by branch closures, because we both had extra capacity in existing facilities. As a result to the RSC facility \u2013 acquisition, we don\u2019t have a lot of excess capacity in our facilities right now. So store consolidation is not the opportunity it was. We actually see the footprint and the employees and the talent in this acquisition as a potential growth platform. So this is not strictly a cost play here and those would be the significant drivers to why that number is different.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks. Good morning guys and congratulation.", "William Plummer", "Hey, thank you.", "Scott Schneeberger", "In Canada, let\u2019s speak there, its sounds like you had really nice rental revenue growth in the U.S. with Canada dragging and if you could just touch on that. And then going a little deeper, what\u2019s underlying in the guidance for Canada for the upcoming year. It seems like you are optimistic in the industrial area in Canada and the U.S. So if you could just elaborate there please? Thanks.", "Matt Flannery", "Sure. I would say that overall, we\u2019re looking at Canada to be flat to slightly up and that varies greatly by provinces, even our experience in Q4. Six of the 10 provinces did have growth \u2013 did have volume growth and there are some robust markets that are doing well. It\u2019s all dragged down by the big rock in Alberta for us with such great penetration and market share in Alberta and that\u2019s where the country has taken its biggest hit. So it\u2019s a little bit of a balancing act. I will say that we\u2019re positioned well enough in all 10 provinces that whatever opportunity it comes.", "We can exceed what we have planned right now and some of that growth capital could shift up there, should they get any tailwind like what you\u2019re referring to is almost 5% industrial growth forecasted. Those forecast always exchange throughout the year, but if it holds true I would imagine that we\u2019d end up putting some of that growth capital into Canada. We\u2019re also continuing some cold start growth in our specialty business in Canada, so there\u2019s more penetration there as an opportunity. So I would say flat is maybe the implied guide, but if that shifts in the opportunity shifts will accordingly shift fleet up there.", "Scott Schneeberger", "All right, thanks Matt. Bill just a quick follow-up on the CapEx. You address the buckets before, thanks for that and if you want to go maybe to re-magnitude those that will be appreciated. But this question is really more about cadence and what type of pattern we should see through the year as we enter. Thanks.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Scott. I won\u2019t go any further on the buckets but regards cadence, you recall the last year, we clamp down pretty hard in the first quarter. So we won\u2019t be that aggressive in the first quarter relative to the rest of the year. This year, if I remember the number from last year was about $100 million in Q1 with the overall increase and with a little bit of a shift in timing. You could see a spin in the neighbourhood of twice that in Q1 this year.", "The second and third quarters will be up dollar wise. But not dramatically so maybe a little bit more of an increase in the third quarter than the second. And then the fourth quarter will be up just a little bit over fourth quarter of 2016. So that some broad guidelines for you to get started and if that doesn\u2019t help ask again in April on the next call.", "Scott Schneeberger", "All right, great. Thanks guys.", "William Plummer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session in today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for closing comments.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thank you. In closing, I want to remind everyone that there\u2019s a new Investor Presentation on our website. That contains more details about the acquisition, if you haven\u2019t seen it already. You will also find seven decks and a webcast from our Investor Day, including more about Project XL. So there\u2019s a lot going on. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the next 90 days. In the meantime feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, who is in-charge of our IR. And if you have any questions, follow-up and/or would like to see a facility. We welcome that. So thank you very much and look forward to our next quarterly call.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program.

", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer. ", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well thanks, operator, and welcome and good morning everyone. Now I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. So let\u2019s get started with 2014. It was a great year for us and [we\u2019ve got] another strong year in 2015. Our message today is about progress, discipline and consistency. These fourth quarter calls tend to frame the year-end as a hard stop, but in reality our performance is a continuum and that's especially true this year, when we went into 2015 with so much momentum. Now I\u2019ll talk about it in a minute, but first I want to give you the last 12 months that are due, because we turned in some outstanding results. ", "Our rates were up 4.5% in line with our guidance. 2014 was the fourth straight year we moved the rates higher and we still see opportunity for improvement. We had record time utilization of 68.8% for the full year. And our return on invested capital was also a record of 8.8%. Together, they helped drive more than $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA on a rental revenue growth that outpaced the industry growth by nearly two-to-one. And our free cash flow was a homerun for the year. This was due in part to the used equipment margin of 48.5%, another indication of the ongoing recovery. ", "And we set 1.7 billion on fleet and as you saw last night, our CapEx plan for 2015 is approximately the same with even higher expectations for free cash flow. Not only do we meet or beat every target in our outlook, we did it while making fundamental improvements the way we operate. Take safety for an example. In 2014, we had the fewest number of recordable injuries in our history. And we drove our full year recordable rate down below 1.0 for the first time. It was a 9th consecutive year of safety improvement for us. So clearly it\u2019s not just a fluke, it\u2019s a progressive exchange for the better in our culture. ", "Specialty rentals was another great story. We grew our specialty segment very effectively last year with a disciplined mix of [NA] cold starts, new fleet and cross selling. Our full year revenue gain in specialty which includes the acquisition of National Pump in April was approximately 83% and a gross margin of almost 51%. That's nearly 400 basis points higher than the prior year and our fourth quarter margin for specialty was up nearly 500 basis points. Company wide, all but one of our regions had year-over-year rental revenue growth for the quarter with more than half of the region showing double-digit growth. ", "And we had a very solid increase in key account revenue up [16%] year-over-year. National accounts which is a subset of our key accounts grew more than 18%, so from every perspective a very strong year. We demanded a lot of ourselves in 2014, and I am happy to say that we outperformed our own expectations. Now let\u2019s talk about this year. I'm going to start by acknowledging the concern that's out there about the effect of oil prices on our industry. ", "Look, we're not running this business with rose-colored glasses and we don\u2019t plan to be caught by surprise. We\u2019ve dug deep into this issue and while we haven\u2019t seen any significant attrition to date, we do expect some impact as rig counts come down. Now we're constantly pulling the field, not just to measure upstream oil activity, but also to gauge any knock-on effect. And we\u2019ve done a lot of detailed analysis based on conservative assumptions to identify our exposure. And Bill is going to share some of those numbers with you in a moment. But I can tell you where they came out. Yes, we think oil prices will reduce demand for certain types of equipment in a handful of areas. ", "But we disagree very strongly with the idea that our growth is at risk and I\u2019ll give you five good reasons why we feel this way. First, upstream oil and gas accounts for only 6% of our business company wide. That's a very modest exposure given our fleet can be utilized for other types of customers. Even in the battlefield states or a state like Texas, we\u2019ve got deep customer relationships outside of oil. Currently more than 80% of our rental revenue in Texas comes from infrastructure, manufacturing, transportation, commercial building and a host of other industries. ", "Second, we\u2019ve strong systems in place for fleet management, including the relocation and the repurposing of CapEx through used sales. And if circumstances change dramatically, we\u2019ve the flexibility to reduce our CapEx spend for the year. We\u2019ve done this before when warranted and we wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Third, we believe that any drag on demand for upstream oil will be mitigated by the positive effect on other industries. Take chemical manufacturing, one of our key sectors. When oil prices decline, manufacturing costs drop, production is stimulated and consumer purchasing power increases. ", "The current growth rate of the US chemical industry is forecast to accelerate to at least 2016. This is just one of many examples. Fourth, the geography plays to our advantage. Our upstream oil exposure touches just a fraction of our footprint in any meaningful way. Now keep in mind, we serve 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces. That gives us a lot of room to deploy our assets. The reality is the [field] has been asking us for significantly more CapEx than we spend for a few years now. And we\u2019ve been very disciplined in reining in that number. ", "So if we decide to move fleet due to localized weakness, we\u2019ve branches that are eager to take it. And fifth, we know how to outperform our end markets as well as our industry. We\u2019ve shown you that for years. In 2014, our 15% rental revenue growth was more than three times the year-over-year growth in non-res construction in November, thanks in part to secular penetration. And it was nearly twice the revenue growth of our industry overall. Not only is there still a lot of runway ahead in the industry up cycle, the macro economy is also trending in our favor. ", "Many economists predict the US GDP growth will be in a range of 3 to 3.3% for 2015 with lower unemployment, more consumer spending on goods and services and a return to housing starts. And to the degree that any uncertainty still remains in our end markets, that actually works in our favor because we offer an alternative to large capital outlays. So when Global Insight forecast nearly 8% rental industry growth for North America in 2015 and with more growth to follow in 2016, which they did on Sunday you can take that as a starting point. But be assured we\u2019ve bigger plans. ", "Bottom line, this recovery has already its share of bumps, and we think oil prices will be another bump. Given our scale and diversification we do not see this as a road block. In fact, we think the bigger picture is that low oil prices could have a significant upside for us over time. And more immediately, we will keep moving forward in a better than expected fourth-quarter by making disciplined investment to capture profitable business. I\u2019ve already mentioned that our specialty group is on a fast track. Power and HVAC in particular turned in a standout performance with 27% same-store growth and a 61% increase in revenue overall in 2014. ", "For 2015 we\u2019ve earmarked a $170 million or about 30% of our [gross] rental CapEx to meet the increasing demand of our specialty fleet. And we plan to open at least 16 new branches, this includes cold starts for all of our specialty lines, power and HVAC, trench safety, pumps and tools. Our growth in specialty also reflects cross-selling to our broader operations where we're seeing good diversity in large projects. For example, our central US districts are predicting a big year with the wide range of projects underway or with the start dates in the next few months. ", "This includes healthcare, education, hydropower, renewables, bioresearch and transportation to name a few. Further west, we\u2019ve got equipment on mega sites like [LAS] and a queue of major project work lined up. In the southeast are our mixed use developments, sports arenas, theme parks and airports. And in the [northeast] our customers in the high-growth verticals are hungry to stamp up any fleet that comes available, and that's typical to many of our regions. ", "I hope I have given you a substantial insight into our thinking on 2015. Our outlook is positive because the facts support it. If we like what we see, we like what we hear from our customers then every indication is that the equipment rental is going to look at a multi-year up cycle with an ongoing recovery in our end markets and a tailwind from secular penetration. But we're also agile and we are well prepared to respond to any changes in our operating environment. We plan to spend $1.7 billion in rental CapEx this year, because we believe the demand is there. ", "And we can adjust that number either way and regarding to at least $6 billion of revenue and approximately $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA, because we believe that we can hit these marks. We\u2019ve done the math and we are already moving forward on our goals. So now Bill will cover the financial results and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So over to you, Bill. ", "Bill Plummer", "Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll move through the financial results pretty quickly, so we can save some time to talk about the oil and gas analysis Mike mentioned, and the outlook which we wanted to make sure that we get. I\u2019ll start with revenue. Rental Revenue was a pretty strong quarter for us as Mike mentioned. Total rental revenue increased 16.5%, that's a $187 million year-over-year in the quarter. And as usual I\u2019ll bridge that 187 number. Re-rent and Ancillary continue to be nice contributors to revenue growth for us. Re-rent and Ancillary combined were up 26 million year-over-year. ", "But the real driver is Owned Equipment Rental Revenue growth. That was up 16.3% for the quarter or a $161 million year-over-year. Here are the components of that 161. Rental rate up 4.1%, as you saw drives about $40 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. Volume was up 10.7% and that drove a $106 million worth of year-over-year revenue improvement. And that obviously includes the impact of National Pump fleet being added to the volume calculation. Our inflation on the fleet was a headwind. It was 18 million detracting from the year-over-year change and then the [rest], we\u2019ll call it mix and other including FX was a positive 33 million. ", "Within that 33 million, in addition to the volume that Pump brought along, Pump operates at a higher dollar utilization. So they had a positive impact on mix of about $28 million within the 33. And then I would also call out the effect of FX in the quarter was pretty significant as a headwind, about $10 million of FX detraction from our year-over-year revenue performance. The other components were a sum of a whole bunch of other nips and naps in the year-over-year performance. So those were the key drivers of our revenue performance in the quarter. For rental revenue, I would also point out that we had a very robust used equipment sales result for the quarter. ", "Used was up 16% over last year and as importantly, the margin was also very good, 48.7% adjusted gross margin on our used equipment sales in the quarter. Certainly helped by our continued focus on driving as much as we can through our retail channel along with the overall market price environment continues to be pretty solid in the fourth quarter. We also just touched on and had a very good new equipment sales quarter with robust growth in new equipment. ", "On profitability, I\u2019ll bridge the EBITDA performance year-over-year for us. We had a company record for fourth quarter of $775 million of adjusted EBITDA and likewise it was a company record, 49.6% margin in the quarter. So that was a $124 million of increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 100 basis point improvement in our margin over fourth quarter of 13. Here are the components of the $124 million year-over-year improvement. The rental rate improvement that I mentioned earlier for revenue drops through the EBITDA at $39 million. That's just using a 95% flow through on the rental rate revenue dollars. ", "Volume contributed $74 million worth of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. And then we had a couple of other positives here. Ancillary, re-rent I mentioned along with some other small pieces contributed about $16 million. Used equipment sales, I mentioned the improvement in volume and margin there. That contributed about $14 million of improvement and then a pump, the Cat.Class of pumps because of their mixed contribution contributed about $15 million worth of positive mix impact. Working against those positives, we had fleet inflation. That was about an $11 million headwind. ", "Additional incentive comp, we've very strong incentive comp year and quarter and our adjustment to the incentive comp there cost us about $10 million over the prior year. That debt expense cost us about $8 million. We had a strong bad debt expense result in the fourth quarter of 13. We\u2019ve more normalized result in 14 along with a larger AR balance. So that's the driver there for that $8 million headwind. Merit increases were about $6 million and all other was the remaining one. So those are the components of our adjusted EBITDA change for year-over-year. If you look down at EPS, we had an adjusted EPS of $2.19 for the quarter, up very nicely from $1.59 the prior year. So overall a very, very strong profit picture for the quarter as Mike mentioned. ", "Real quickly on cash flow, we had a great free cash flow performance in the quarter as well. $557 million of free cash flow the way we calculated, but I\u2019ll remind everyone that that includes merger-related cash payments of about $17 million in the quarter. So the way we look at free cash flow in the quarter or excuse me, this is full year. The way we look at free cash flow for the full year is a $574 million result. The real driver there and it did come in stronger than we expected. The real driver was better EBITDA performance along with really, really strong collections. We\u2019ve mentioned that before, but our AR collections have been coming in very strong for the last number of months now and that was a big part of the betterment there in free cash flow. ", "Just real briefly to touch on our share repurchase program. We\u2019ve been repurchasing shares. We mentioned that we brought back about a $102 million of shares under the new $750 million authorization in the month of December. We add to that in the month of January. To date in January, we spent an extra $125 million. So we're now at $227 million of repurchases against that $750 million repurchase authorization. So that's the latest update for share repurchase. ", "Also as Mike mentioned, I\u2019ll just reiterate. We had a very nice improvement in our return on invested capital, 8.8% for the full year. And that's a 130 basis point improvement over the prior year with the fourth quarter sequentially improving by 40 basis points. So we feel very good about the return direction that we\u2019ve the company pointed at. Now let\u2019s talk about oil. As Michael mentioned, we\u2019ve done a lot of work assessing possible impacts from low oil prices. And we\u2019ve done it in a variety of different ways. We keep coming up with the same conclusion which is that, we think any reasonable expectation for impact is manageable. ", "Here is one way that we have taken a look at it, we think will resonate with folks. If we look at every branch in our company that has oil and gas revenue, we decided that the best way to look at this was to model that oil and gas revenue taking a significant hit. So in this case, we said any branch that had oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue. The upstream portion of their revenue stream, let\u2019s assume it takes a 35% hit. In addition for any branch that has more than a de minimis amount of oil and gas revenue, upstream oil and gas revenue. ", "Let\u2019s also assume that everything else, all of their other revenue take a 15% hit. So they get hit 35 in oil and gas upstream, they get hit 15 for everything else. If you do that and add it up across our company, the aggregate amount of fleet that would be freed up by those kinds of impacts would total about $400 million of average annual fleet. So 400 million, you know relative to an $8 billion plus fleet, you could you know say hey, let\u2019s dismiss that. That's not significant, but we don\u2019t think about it that way. $400 million is certainly a good amount of fleet to move around. Then we further ask ourselves, what could it mean financially? ", "And we made some assumptions, so the 400 million is the average annual fleet. Will that kind of an impact happen over the full year? We said no. Let\u2019s just evaluate having that impact build over the year and say it\u2019s fully in effect at the second half. So the second half is really where that hit would apply. So that 400 million annual impact really in calendar 2015 would only have the effect of about 200 million on a full-year basis. We ask ourselves, how much of that kind of a downside could we absorb, could we mitigate? ", "And while many of us could argue that we could absorb all of that kind of a hit, we decided to be a conservative in our downside analysis and assume we could only mitigate half of that. So the 200 million annual rate, we cut down to about a $100 million annual impact that represented real exposure to our company. How much of that $100 million of fleet worth, we assumed a dollar utilization on that. That was very high relative to the rest of our company. We used 60% in our analysis, so 60% is at least 5% percentage points higher than the dollar utilizations that we reasonably could expect in the second half for even the highest performing regions in our company. ", "So 60% on that $100 million annual impact gives you a $60 million revenue impact and [indiscernible] through at 60% EBITDA, it\u2019s about a $36 million EBITDA impact. So when you look at it in that light, it doesn\u2019t scare you, right. It\u2019s not the end of the world to say, there is a $36 million [holed up] that, we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to fill. And as we said, we think that the options are fairly conservative. The good news as Mike mentioned in his comments is that we\u2019ve a sense that there is going to be robust demand in other areas outside of oil and gas. ", "And other product types that we think can help address even if this what we\u2019ve believe is a [indiscernible] downside plays out. So that\u2019s the way we're thinking about the risk from oil gas and if you add the $36 million impact that we just walked through to or to subtract that from what we expect for the full year, we still feel like we can deliver the range of adjusted EBITDA that we\u2019ve given in our guidance. Speaking of our guidance for 2015, just to reiterate the key points you have already seen, we expect total revenue in the range of 6 to 6.2 billion. Within that rental revenue will be driven by rates at about 3.5% for year and time utilization of about 69% or twenty basis points improved over the last year. ", "The adjusted EBITDA range of 2.95 to 3.05, again we feel is a range that represents the most likely outcome for the year. We do expect to spend about a 1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx and have that net down to about 1.2 billion for the year. And free cash flow will be a very robust result for us this year, somewhere between 7.25 and 7.75 is what we expect. Obviously that's significantly higher than the about 600 number that we guided to back in our Investor Day in December. And it really reflects the re-enactment of bonus depreciation for calendar 14, that Congress and President Obama signed just recently. ", "So put it all together and it looks like a very robust year for us. We wouldn\u2019t say that, if we didn\u2019t believe that and believe that we had the ability to manage to that, oil and gas certainly is an exposure for us, but it's an opportunity as well. And we're going to look to take advantage of the opportunities that it presents as we always have. And if we can do that, we feel like we\u2019ll be having a good conversation at this time next year. ", "So with that, that ends our prepared comments and we can open up the call for questions and answers. Operator? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question, please? ", "Ted Grace", "I was hoping to ask on 2015 margins. You know I know you give revenue guidance, you give EBITDA guidance. And so we can back into kind of what\u2019s implied on the margin in an incremental basis. But you know Bill, maybe if you could walk through qualitatively some of the key headwinds or tailwinds, we should just think about influencing where we might come out on that range. So you know things like mix, fuel costs, incentive comp, Lean, inflation, just to help kind of give us some guideposts? ", "Bill Plummer", "Sure. So I\u2019ll start, but certainly Michael, please, please chime in. As we think about top line, you know a couple of things that swirl in the background in our thinking. Obviously walk through our oil and gas risk assessment, but you know the question is, did we get it right? Could it be worse than that? Conversely, could it be better than that? So those are the things that surround oil and gas performance, but that may buy us the revenue one way or another. And I\u2019ll leave you to make your own judgment about you know how much risk you think there is. ", "FX is another factor that we certainly need to be aware of. Yeah, the Canadian dollar has been weakening pretty consistently. Average Canadian was down last year by about you know 6 to 7%. And right now as we said, if it flat lined from where it fits right now at about $0.81, that would be another 6% or so year-over-year headwind from the currency going down. So that's a nontrivial amount of revenue that could -- that could erode. The guidance we gave is total revenue. So you\u2019ve to be mindful of used and new as well. ", "And our plan for used equipment sales this year is a reduction over what we achieved in 2014. You know just looking at the difference between gross CapEx and net rental CapEx, you know we're guiding to something like $500 million of used sales proceeds. That compares to 549 this year or in 14. So that will be a little bit of you know an impact to the revenues and maybe keeps the revenue guidance from being higher than it is. And then you know there are other items that might impact at the adjusted EBITDA lines. So for example, we had a very robust incentive compensation this year. ", "And when we [reach] the incentive comp targets for 2015, our [base line] plan assumes that we hit target and only pay out at target. We paid out you know nicely above target this year. So you know that will impact in a positive way, where we might end up on the adjusted EBITDA line. And a host of other issues, you mentioned Lean. The Lean initiatives are still rolling out and building momentum. You know we finished the quarter, still a little bit of [indiscernible] under here. We finished the year at an annualized run rate of about $30 million of Lean impact. That's up from the 23 that we reported at the end of the third quarter. ", "So that's another you know factor that's playing through our expectations for 2015. So I\u2019ll start there and again, Mike I don\u2019t know if you guys want to say anything or if I've have forgotten anything, please jump in. ", "Matt Flannery", "Well, I think you captured it Bill. It\u2019s important to note the difference in used sales is really about what has reached the [indiscernible] in the year. And we don\u2019t have as much fleet that we have [indiscernible], so that's our, why we're guiding lower there. If retail opportunities go over and above that, you know or well we may swing, but I think it\u2019s a good target based on what we want to move out to keep our fleet fresh and to the targets we set, yeah. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah, I would only add that you know everything that Bill and Matt said is spot on. I think that if you look at the projections of the industry at 8% for North America, is a little bit higher than what we experienced or what they projected in \u2018014. So could there be some you know on rate, could it be opportunities. It could be, I don\u2019t know to really, we somewhat tempered it you know as we went into the oil, but that could be an upside for us going forward. ", "Bill Plummer", "Well one other point Ted is that you know, I know where you are going, right. You are looking at the midpoints of revenue and EBITDA, and saying hey flow through there and comes out at you know pretty high level, 68 plus percent. That's you know an artifact of the fact that we're using ranges and the fact that the flow through calculation is very sensitive. If we were asked point blank, we would still say that we think about flow through for 2015 being something like 60% with [indiscernible] toward the upside because of the net effect of all of the things that I mentioned earlier. ", "So if you're modeling I would say, you know get your revenue where you want it, at 60% and then maybe put your thumb up to be a little bit higher you know to reflect some of the net benefits that we expect to accrue over the course of the year. ", "Ted Grace", "That's super helpful. The only follow up I would have is, any willingness to quantify kind of what Lean expectations are? I now you exhibited a run rate of 30, you're targeting a 100+ through the program over a few years. But any sense, could you just calibrate us in what a tailwind might look like this year? ", "Matt Flannery", "Well you could do the trends, the math, Ted. You could do the trends. I mean we would expect it to follow that trend, right. So we\u2019ve said external targets, I mean internal targets above that 14. We put even extra emphasis on it this year, but I feel very comfortable that we're, we will keep at steady pace towards that $100 million by the end of 16. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Jordan from Jefferies. Your question please? ", "Justin Jordan", "I just wanted to talk about the nice problem of having extra free cash flow and what that might mean in terms of changes or the board\u2019s thinking about the capital allocation in calendar 15. Because obviously, relative to the guidance you gave on December 4th, essentially you\u2019ve increased free cash flow guidance by you know 25% overnight. Now I appreciate there\u2019s a tax implication here that's not really, you know that much of a percentage again. But is that changing how you think about potential specialty M&A? Is that changing how you think about you leveraging or potentially changing how you think about the amount of stock repurchasing you might do in 15? ", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. No, that is -- ", "Justin Jordan", "You might like to give a bit more [color] on that. ", "Michael Kneeland", "No, you get one question. I think what we\u2019ve done with M&A is that we're always looking at M&A opportunities. And I'm flipping, but I don't think it changes how we think about M&A. If we found the right M&A opportunity, then we would go ahead and do that, whether we were at you know 600 or 700 or 775 of free cash flow. So M&A wouldn't change. I think it is fair to say that, you know as we look at the share repurchase program, if you got more cash flow and you want to pass the leverage and you know we\u2019ve already said, we expect to be towards the low end of the leverage range that you know that we want to operate in by the end of this year. ", "Right, we\u2019ve called 2.6 as the leverage ratio we expect before the increase in free cash flow. So I think we would be more inclined to say okay let's not go crazy and go below the 2.5 kind of leverage ratio this year now that we\u2019ve got more cash flow coming in. So that may change how we think about the timing of the share repurchase program. And I think that's a sensible way to think about it. So that's all still to be discussed and certainly we will talk about more, when we make more decisions. But I think M&A doesn't change, but everything else we kind of put in the mix and say okay, we got an extra $100 million. What do you want to do with it and we will make that call. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital. Your question please? ", "Seth Weber", "I wanted to talk about your CapEx commentary, specifically you know the comments around flexibility around CapEx. And you know you kept the 1.7 billion gross number for the year. Should we think about cadence this year being similar to how it's been in the prior years of 60-65% in the first half? Or do you hold back some of the spending you know to wait and see how the markets evolve? That's my first question. ", "And then kind of as add-on to that, I mean it sounds like your specialty as a percentage of growth capital is down. You know I think last year, it was something like, I don't know 270-280 something like that and now it's 170, I think you said. Is that reduction primarily focused on the Pump business or how should we think about you know your growth capital going towards the specialty category? Thanks. ", "Matt Flannery", "Sure, Seth. I will answer both questions. The first as far as the cadence, if we plan out to being similar to this year, you know that we have a really strong flexibility as far as we don't need to make a decision if we're going to ship until literally a week before it's going to ship. So the second quarter, by April I think we will get a very good feel of it, the second quarter is going to be more or less and it will all be demand driven. The first quarter is light already which is good for us and right now we are restricting the inflow of CapEx obviously in the markets that we think may have a little bit softening in demand in the back half of the year. ", "So I really think we will get a better picture on how much we adjust from our norm. And I would call last year\u2019s cadence a new norm, depending on what the demand is and where we're getting our returns and where our customers need our services. So that's how we feel about the cadence. As far as the specialty, we spent, we plan on spending over 30% of our growth capital on specialty. You're talking about more of a gross number when you are referring to last year\u2019s number. And a lot of that was, I would say re-fleeting our Pump, right so we need that acquisition to grow. ", "And fleeting up the many cold starts that we have done in our other specialty segments, these specifically power even the year before. So they were now ready to absorb scale. So we really pushed a lot into the cold starts over the last couple of years and we will do some more cold starts this year, but not at the scale that we did over the past few years. ", "Seth Weber", "Okay sorry, Matt. So my, was my math incorrect. I thought that your specialty last year represented, you know like half of the growth capital or something like that of the -- ", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. You are closed down that number. The Matt\u2019s point, if you go back to \u2018013, we had a significant amount of our cold starts stop, that were in the later part of the fourth quarter. That a lot of that CapEx ran into 2014 and then the cold starts that we had through the course of the year, and then treating all of those as we went through the year. So in total numbers, it's down. You are right, but it hasn't changed our view on specialty. We do reserve the right on you know Pump to understand what impact upstream could or could not have as we go through our cost opportunities. ", "And as I mentioned, we will do cold starts with Pump to broaden their reach. And that was one of the key aspects of the acquisition, was making sure that, if you recall 6% of their business was only in our commercial and industrial space. So we see that as a significant opportunity, so it's kind of more of a tempered look if we take a look at it. And as I also mentioned, if there is a need for more growth capital, we\u2019ve got it and we will do it. And flexibility is built into our model. ", "Seth Weber", "Okay and then Matt can you, have you seen anything, can you make any comments on used equipment pricing because I think that\u2019s something that people are increasingly you know nervous about? ", "Matt Flannery", "Well other than that [indiscernible], so we enjoyed a real robust fourth-quarter from a volume, a little bit more than we even expected in the month of December and with margins holding flat. So and flat at a very high level, so we are seeing still a robust used equipment market. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please? ", "David Raso", "Hi, on the oil downside scenario, I was just curious what percent of your entire fleet is captured on what you're considering you know at-risk territories? And then secondarily just trying to think through rental rates in that scenario, just trying to capture if you feel there is any potential knock-on effect to rates and territories where other equipment might be going into or you know essentially just even the rates pressure you may see in those weaker energy sensitive markets? ", "Bill Plummer", "So, I will tackle the rate one first. The 3.5, about 3.5 guidance that we gave is lower than where we were thinking about rates you know, call it a month ago or two months ago. And so in that sense you know we have included some conservatism to you know to a flat effect, that rate could be pressured as that oil and gas dynamic plays out. And yet we still say 3.5, could it be worse than that, obviously it could. But again, we think we have got opportunities to respond and manage it down. I don't remember off the top of my head, the first question of what percent of the fleet. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Well if you just do the math, right. So we said the 35% knock-on, I mean a 35% upstream would net in about 400 million. So it's over a billion, I would say it\u2019s somewhere in the billion and 1.2 billion, I don't have the number right handy in front of me. But I think that, well actually, it\u2019s probably 1.2 billion of fleet that we think will be impacted and those are markets that have oil and gas upstream business today. ", "David Raso", "Okay, I mean I maybe oversimplifying it. Because that's not everything in these states are driven by energy. But I'm just thinking about 29% of your branches and all branches aren\u2019t the same, I know that. But just going with the data we have, 29% of branches are in what I would consider nearly somewhat energy-sensitive states in the oil sands. And in your analysis, you're saying kind of roughly half of that\u2019s at risk, I guess right because 1.2 of the 8.44 billion of fleet is about 14%. Is that the right way to think of it roughly, half of the branches in those states in the oil sands is sort of at risk? I am just trying to understand the analysis. ", "Bill Plummer", "Yeah, it's hard to do the analysis based on branches in states and get anything useful in our opinion. That's why we went to the individual locations and tried to reason from what business they have that\u2019s exposed right here and now. So we didn\u2019t do it, to you know to go to great levels of detail on you know how much fleet that at, you know how many branches or in which states. We have that, I don't know that it's something we want to go through in great detail. But just the $400 million impact, I think really it does capture a pretty good view of what the exposure might be. ", "But if you don't believe it, okay make it a $500 million impact. Let's say we are off by 25% or even a $600 million impact and say we're off by 50%. You know, the end result doesn't change dramatically, right. It\u2019s a still a 35-40-45-$50 million kind of risk, even with conservative assumptions about how far down it goes and how much we can mitigate. I like our chances with that kind of risk scenario.", "David Raso", "Yeah, no I appreciate. I think the issue is, is there more territory at risk than solely branches that happen to have upstream oil and gas in that region? I mean you know it's just, it's obviously just a debate right now about contagion beyond just those direct areas? And also on the rates, I mean you have done a great job this cycle on saying that, well we're not going to throw capital off the fleet just to grow. We're going to focus on better returns. ", "Should I expect if, you know if I'm thinking maybe a little more cautiously about the impact in broader contagion, you are going hold the rate before you try to hold utilization? I mean if I had the model from downside sensitivity, should I be taking it more down on utilization, you would argue or taking down on rates. I'm just trying to get a feel for philosophically if things got weaker than your forecast thing? ", "Matt Flannery", "It will depend right on what the demand is and what we are seeing. But I would say that we are going to have utilization at the levels that it needs to be at because we can do, we can manage that. We can manage how much fleet we put into the market and how much fleet we remove out of the market. So I think we will be very diligent on those rates in time, but time is much more easily manageable. And I think as Bill stated, we built in a little conservatism on the rate because moving the fleet from higher rate areas and you grow fleet into areas that aren\u2019t your top 10% is going to have some knock-on, whether it's a quarter point or half a point, I don't think we really know yet. But I think we captured it in our guidance. ", "Michael Kneeland", "And I guess I will [indiscernible] in that then, as we feel that utilization is coming under some pressure, while you want to hold the rate, it might play with it a bit. But the key is, you also have the outlet [indiscernible]. I mean I guess that's the idea. If used prices hold up, you can manage utilization also by just simply shedding some fleet. And I think that's a key issue of used prices. If they hold up, you can do that relatively profitably, but that's you know obviously a part of the debate. So we should think of let\u2019s just trying to move the fleet, you also can tap you know the retail market the best you can on selling used. ", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital. ", "Joe Box", "I got a question on your construction pipeline on slide 13. And I just want to tie that together maybe with your methodology on guidance. So how should we be thinking about the $370 billion pipeline and how you incorporate that into your guidance? And then maybe just you know to take it one step further, what are your guys on the ground telling you for some of these you know energy sensitive projects that have already started or maybe are just a few months away from breaking ground? Are they concerned about this, or are they you know thinking everything kind of moves forward as planned? ", "Matt Flannery", "So this is Matt, Joe. So we do have some key account managers that specifically just call on oil and gas. So obviously they are hearing the most noise about whether it\u2019s future concerns or some job cancellations. But even in that space, the pipeline was so robust that individually they may have opportunities. I think more importantly the other 90% of our key accounts managers are extremely encouraged. Because we\u2019ve always sent the fleet to the highest return opportunity and oil and gas was pretty hot for a while. You could argue we may have underserved a lot of other opportunities that will give us very good returns and a little bit more geographically diverse. ", "So I think that, what we are hearing on the ground is encouragement and opportunity in markets like the West Coast, even the Northwest, the Southeast, the mid-Atlantic where you could see the map that we have on the investor deck and I think it was slide 14, where you see there\u2019s some real opportunities. So that's what we're hearing, that's why we feel very strong about our guidance, our customers have the demand and our boots on the ground are seeing it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please? ", "Scott Schneeberger", "I will follow up on Joe's question. On slide 14 that is, it's a nice add. It says construction overall, is that non-res construction, could you specify. And then could you speak to the end markets in those six or seven states where you see the double-digit growth? Thanks. ", "Matt Flannery", "So would you want to know about the verticals that are or where the opportunities are in those states or just the specific states? ", "Scott Schneeberger", "No, you would see the states on slide 14. The vertical opportunities in those states and what type of construction specifically? ", "Matt Flannery", "So I think Mike covered a little bit of it in his opening remarks. When I say it\u2019s broad, it\u2019s broad. I mean there is multiple stadiums, multiple car plant expansions, manufacturing. I say the single largest vertical would probably be chemical. Chemical plants have shown robust growth. Even in the state of Texas, right, we talk a lot about the contagion impact in Texas. We have a very large portion of our business in Texas that's chemical related. And that's forecast to be 26% growth in Texas. ", "So we think that there is many verticals that are positive and places that we are going to serve in 2015. And it is that broad base, just why I am not, I mean chemical stands out. It's just how much growth there is, which is why I'm not holding in on the other vertical because it's very broad. ", "Scott Schneeberger", "Okay thanks. Just following up on that, how much of that is forecasted and how much of that do you feel is in hand at this point of the year? Thanks. ", "Matt Flannery", "So I don't have place in front of me right now, but you could think about it as the pipeline through the seasons of the year. And certainly there is less dark right now, although our time [indiscernible] remain very strong. I would say by mid-summer you're going to see at least half of that pipeline materialize in rental opportunity. So and then it's just a matter of how quick things move from it and that's standard with the construction cycle that we have been experiencing throughout my career. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please? ", "Joe O'Dea", "A question just on the potential risk of accelerated fleet growth across the industry with, you know what is a pretty strong backdrop. And really, you know your ability to monitor what your competitors are doing and if there is any particular competitor segment, whether that's by region or size of competitor, that you think would be the largest risk to maybe over accelerating fleet growth and adding some rental rate price pressure? ", "Bill Plummer", "So yeah, I\u2019ll start. You know the ability to monitor is pretty good, right. We're everywhere and we touch I won\u2019t say every customer, but a lot of the market. And so we\u2019ve got real time intelligence on what our competitors are doing. And we feel we\u2019ve the ability to respond if we think responding is appropriate. And that's one of the advantages of being who we are. In terms of you know what competitor might be most at risk. I won\u2019t name names here, I\u2019ll leave you to make your own judgment about that. All we can say is that United Rentals is going to be very conscious about any [CapEx] decision, whether it\u2019s to increase or decrease. And it\u2019s going to be driven by what we\u2019ve taken in from the market. ", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. ", "Jerry Revich", "Can you gentlemen talk about what you are hearing from your refining customers? I think there was one of RSC\u2019s bigger industrial end markets if I remember their disclosure is right. We\u2019ve seen them you know cut back in CapEx, but I think their equipment spend more on the maintenance side of every day type work. Is that right, can you just give us an update for that end market? ", "Matt Flannery", "Certainly, so we\u2019ve heard of some CapEx cutbacks and I would say probably more severe in the oil sands than anywhere else. And there have been a couple of projects in the Gulf that have cancelled. But I would say overall, that pipeline is still robust and you are accurate. The large amount of onsite relationships that we acquired during the merger with RSC really, really gives us a strong base to work from. We're not seeing any slowdown of that maintenance at all. As a matter of fact, our industrial region is showing the highest time utilization we\u2019ve in the company right now, and the highest year-over-year growth. ", "So and they are primarily on-sites and what I would call a downstream oil and gas and chemical plants. And we're just seeing a real strong growth there and I don\u2019t think the maintenance is going to take a hit here. I think it\u2019s mostly capital spend, which if we really wanted to be rosy, you could say there\u2019s an opportunity there for us to get more penetration as capital continues to get cut from some of the end markets. ", "Bill Plummer", "Yeah just, I was going to just say, also on our slide, you know our customer confidence index, you know reaching. We only, only of the 170 key accounts that we reached out to, only 1% saw a slower growth in 2015. We spent an awful lot of time in preparation for this call, reaching out to our customers, reaching out to our employees. You know I know more about oil in the last two weeks than my 35 years in the industry. And you know I would tell you that, you know we haven\u2019t seen any significant impact, talking to our customers, steel erectors. ", "Steel erectors and you take a look at our book of business and bidding. Not one of the projects I saw had any relationship to oil at all. And it was, they would say it\u2019s a record opportunity and year for them coming up on their bidding requirements. So you know that along with Jerry, the feedback that we're getting from ARA and the Global Insight, which by the way you know has been inside this industry for close to 7 years, maybe longer working with our industry, refining the nuances of their model on you know how this industry reacts to things. When they come out with 8%, you know we take that at the heart. And that's not soft, that's not easy, and we think that that's a good indication of where our industry is going. ", "Jerry Revich", "Thank you and Matt, just a clarification if you don't mind. The cancellations that you mentioned, was that ground up projects that you are referring to, or is that just brownfield type work? ", "Matt Flannery", "The ground up projects, and so there were a couple of plants. I mean the pipeline that we went through in our fourth quarter QBRs with our regions, we saw more projects start with a billion than I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years combined. And candidly, if half of those projects cut, I think it will be more robust pipeline than we had over the past few years as far as large projects. And we\u2019ve seen you know maybe 10% of those get cut off the table right now. Because of the concerns that everybody has, so they will hold up on some of these new construction, new capital projects. But and I still feel that the pipeline as Mike stated and we all stated is very robust and the Global Insight survey just kind of supports what we're hearing from our customers and from our boots on the ground. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. ", "Steven Fisher", "How would you guys describe your expectations for Canada overall in 2015 relative to the US? I know you just mentioned some oil sands, a weakness, but just Canada overall. And then how easy is it to reallocate equipment from Canada to the US or would you more envision reallocating amongst the provinces? Thank you. ", "Michael Kneeland", "I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Matt to tie in. But you know as part of the overview with ARA, they are looking at a little over a 3% growth for all of Canada. That combines with the 8.5% they are projecting for the US and it would give them just around 8%, 8.1% of growth for North America. I actually think that Eastern Canada, which you know by the way has been down over the last several years, we\u2019ll see some activity there, and you know come forward. The only headwind we would have as Bill mentioned is the currency exchange from our revenue, but in constant dollars we would expect that to grow. So we see that the Canadian market grow and then probably less growth on Western Canada than we have experienced in the past. ", "Matt Flannery", "Yeah, I would agree Mike. You know we\u2019ll just stay in the same currency right, because that's how I would manage those businesses and judge them. We\u2019ll see growth in both of those, in both Western and Eastern Canada regions next year. And like all of our regions, we do zero growth CapEx budget, so we're going to have to earn their growth as they stack ranked against their peers. And they fared pretty well in the past and I expect them to fare pretty well in the future, specifically Western Canada. ", "Steven Fisher", "And in terms of reallocating equipment between Canada and the US, is that something that you would envision doing and then how easy is that? ", "Michael Kneeland", "I think because we have, when you think about the 1.7 billion of new capital that we spend, you know that's 20% of [8.4] base, if we start with this year\u2019s base. We historically have been able to re-shift geographically by utilizing equipment sales and either not replacing in that market or not putting growth capital in that market. So we\u2019ve been able to geographically remix through that. If we had to put trucks under fleet we do that, and there are some intricacies of doing it from Western Canada. ", "But if it was really dropping, that's not something that we would do. The cost are minimal compared to the opportunity you would have by reallocating. But right now, they are running high time utilization and we're just going to manage the influx into any of these oil and gas markets first. And I think that will prevent them from having to move fleet, but we can react very quickly, whether it\u2019s Canada or somewhere else to move the fleet. ", "Operator", "Thank you and our final question due to time constraints comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? ", "Nicole DeBlase", "So just, most of mine have been answered, but just you know one on utilization. So I was kind of surprising to see that you are guiding for [indiscernible] utilization in 15. Is that also conservatism around oil and gas risk, or are we kind of at the high water mark for utilization, the [cycle]? ", "Bill Plummer", "I wouldn\u2019t say we're at the high water mark. We still feel we\u2019ve got opportunities to continue to drive utilization. We\u2019ve talked in the past, you know of all three of us, probably reading that we can get into the 70s if the market holds and if we do the things that we think we can do. You know the 69% would be up 20 basis points, so I guess you could call that flat if you like. ", "But that is tempered somewhat like the rate discussion, it\u2019s tempered somewhat by our concern about oil and gas and about, while we think we could mitigate, we don\u2019t know that we will be able to mitigate 100% of any oil and gas quite often. And so we backed off a little than where we were a month or two ago when I talk about 2015. But we still think that\u2019s a very robust performance on utilization and Matt\u2019s comments earlier, you know utilization is something that we certainly have a lot to leverage that we can use, right. If it\u2019s falling down, you can\u2019t sell more or you can buy less and as for as the business you do have over [indiscernible] fleet. So you know we think that we can pull all the appropriate levers and deliver that about 59%. And we think that's, you know that's on the way towards better utilization over the next several years. ", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay thanks, Bill, that's really helpful. And then just for my follow-up, I am taking about 1Q, you know as far as what you guys have seen so far quarter to date, shall we expect to see like normal seasonality this quarter? ", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah, I would say so. We're experiencing very similar metrics that we did till last year when you look at the rate in time utilization, maybe up [ahead] in time for a couple of weeks. But it\u2019s early, I think it will fall right in line with our usual cadence. ", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Well thanks, operator. I hope we\u2019ve gone some distance in bringing clarity to what we see as favorable operating environment in 2015.

And welcome to the United Rentals First Quarter 2010 Investor Conference Call. Please the advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, please note that the company\u2019s press release, comments made on today\u2019s call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control and consequently actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release.", "For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, as well as subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company\u2019s website at www.ur.com.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or public release any revisions of forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations. You should also note that today\u2019s call will include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. This morning I went to spend some time on the external environment, also to share with you where we think we\u2019re in the cycle and then update you on the actions that we\u2019re taking for both the short-term and long-term in order to move the needle towards profitable growth.", "Before I get to that, first the quarter is always -- the first quarter is always the weakest period due to seasonality and this period is no different, it\u2019s been pushed down even further by the weather and also the economy.", "However, we\u2019re starting to see some positive indicators, the turn in the industry, as far as our cycle is concerned was always not a question of if, it was more a question of when. And from the first days of the downturn everybody involved here at United Rentals from the senior management team all the way down to our employees in our front lines have been working hard to ensure that we\u2019re in the best position to benefit in the upturn.", "Today we\u2019re looking forward to sharing some of the specifics with you about the positive momentum that we\u2019re seeing. The first quarter results we reported don\u2019t reflect the strategic momentum that we\u2019re gaining in the field.", "Rental revenue was down 15%, now some of that was due to fleet being down up by 6% on a year-over-year basis. The worst of the environment happened in January through mid-February and then we saw a shift late in February continue into March and March came back stronger than we anticipated.", "Time utilization in the quarter was basically flat on a year-over-year basis at 56.2%. Rates however were down 6.5%, not great, it\u2019s not where we want to be, we put a lot of focus on this and a lot of effort and we\u2019re managing this everyday. However, we\u2019re still under pressure but declines are beginning to show signs of leveling off.", "We\u2019ve been -- seen a very clear positive change in used equipment pricing. The used margin in the first quarter was 31.4% versus 11.9% a year ago. Used equipment pricing is a leading indicator of where we\u2019re in the cycle.", "Now turning to cost cutting, obviously it\u2019s a great story to talk about, particularly the first quarter. SG&A down $22 million, cost of rent down an additional $19 million. Bill is going to go into a lot more detail and discuss our decision to raise the financial targets for both SG&A, as well as the free cash flow target for the year.", "So where are we? It\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re more optimistic than we have been for a while. We see a healthy mix of conditions driving our metrics for the first three months in 2010. Some of that\u2019s coming from the external environment, I\u2019ll talk about that next but a lot is being driven by our own efforts. And that will be my second topic that I want to cover this morning with you.", "So first, looking at the operating environment, here is a look at what we\u2019re seeing in the field. It\u2019s still challenging out there but as we move through the first quarter things seem to get a little better and so far in April the positive trend is continuing.", "Now in terms of geographies, Bill and I spent several weeks in the field during business reviews talking to district managers, branch managers and hourly employees. The tones changed, they\u2019re now more cautiously optimistic.", "Canada, we talked about three months ago, was also going to be a bright spot and that\u2019s holding true. In March rental revenue for Canada as a whole was basically flat on a year-over-year basis in local currency and that\u2019s with 6% less fleet. Right now that\u2019s being driven by the activity in Northeast Canada, but we\u2019re also beginning to see Western Canada come back online as oil prices improve.", "Southeast is also picking up in projects like infrastructure, power plants and bridges. The Gulf area, activity is increasing as industrial plants return to a more normalized maintenance schedule, which impacts the local economies.", "California, if you recall was the first to see the weakness back in 2008 and had a terrible track record as it went through the recession. We\u2019re now seeing that level off both in North and Southern California. However, the Midwest is still the weakest and it will be for a while. However, we got some good news yesterday with the ABI index for the region up over 50 for the first time in a long time.", "Now a lot of recent big projects are tied to infrastructure, helping the performance of our trench safety, pump and power operations. I\u2019ll give you an example, revenues were down 7% in the first quarter and rental revenues for that segment were up 10% on a year-over-year basis for March alone. A stimulus money is driving some of that performance but there\u2019s also uptick in underground construction which is also a typical of leading edge of a recovery.", "Now we\u2019ve said that before, we expect public construction and infrastructure to recover first, followed by institutional construction and then, commercial construction being the last to show improvement. But there\u2019s also a historical sequence to the metrics that I\u2019ve experienced in my career with used prices improving, recovering first, then time utilization would improve and lastly, you would see rates improve after that. We believe that will happen in this cycle too.", "And when you look at the first quarter, as I mentioned, used equipment pricing for most categories is the best we\u2019ve seen in over a year. Rates are lagging in the cycle, as we expected but the year-over-year decline is moderating.", "Now to give you some early insight into the first quarter (inaudible) into April, rates have been essentially flat. So when you put the rate trend together with used equipment pricing and time utilization, which is continuing a positive trend as we move through April, it suggests that though we saw the worst part of the cycle in the first quarter.", "So the big question is, where do we go from here? Our opinion hasn\u2019t changed. We expect to see an increasing number of local markets begin to recover as we move through the balance of the year. It\u2019s not going to be an upward trajectory. It\u2019s going to remain choppy. A broader recovery will begin in the back half of 2010 and take hold in 2011. Please feel free to ask us more about the environment in the Q&A.", "Now I want to turn our discussion to operations and talk about actions that we\u2019re taking to transform the way we create long-term value. We\u2019ve been very successful at cutting costs; as you know, we reported last night further cost reductions. It\u2019s becoming part of our culture and we\u2019re committed to doing more, providing a low cost structure going forward.", "Now we\u2019re pivoting towards revenue generation. See -- we\u2019re beginning to see some momentum of our strategy, which is our customer service and customer segmentation to operation of United. Our strategy is not about the economy, it\u2019s about United Rentals and it\u2019s where we intend to take this company and the actions that we\u2019re taking to reach those goals.", "Leveraging our footprint and fleet through our people, focusing our sales efforts on larger more profitable accounts, key accounts, national, strategic, government and local accounts, that have been assigned a single point of contact.", "Also investing in areas to drive growth, for example, our headcount is down in the first quarter year-over-year, but the number of national and strategic account managers is up 27%.", "So the segmentation strategy is working. Numbers show that our larger target customers are the right customers for our long-term growth. They\u2019re more stable in times of economic uncertainty. National account revenue is only down 6% year-over-year in the first quarter.", "We serve these accounts more profitably overtime, there\u2019s more upside in terms of share of wallet and there\u2019s more benefit realized on both sides from servicing these accounts through a single point of contact.", "Today we now have coverage of 50% of our revenue, meaning our reps are assigned directly to customers. Equally as important, complete visibility through our sales force automation, also pursuing industrial business with our goal of 30% of rental revenue, currently for the quarter at 19%, but it continues to make progress. Of the 65 national accounts signed in the first quarter, 25 were industrial with a total wallet estimated to be at $25 million.", "Now within our national accounts team we now have a broad base of managers who are subject matter experts in industrial to help us grow that business. Everything I just mentioned relates to target customers, also paying close attention to the rest of our customer base, our sales initiatives in place and designed to drive revenue generation across all markets.", "One of the examples of that is reactivating dormant accounts. In March, we pushed out through our sales force automation tool 7,000 we call quiet accounts, accounts that revenue was declining over the last trailing 12 months. We generated over $1.3 million of additional revenue in March alone by calling on these customers.", "Our customer care center is taking more proactive call and revenue generation to cold calling. Our center to us is a key differentiator and we believe our center is the only one in the industry with the ability to solve 100% of the customer\u2019s needs with one contact.", "For example, you can take an order and place it anywhere in North America, you can take a unit off rent or just answer a question, it\u2019s multilingual, open 24x7.", "There\u2019s a lot going on with our service initiatives as well in 2010. The customer focused scorecard, our price optimization software or workflow process to drive efficiencies and field automation. We\u2019ve talked about these initiatives before and we\u2019ll have more to say as we move through the year to report our progress. But if you\u2019ve specific questions today we\u2019ll be happy to answer the best we can.", "So, service is where our business is at. It\u2019s the right thing to focus on as a differentiator. It\u2019s also listening and learning from our customers. It\u2019s critically important to revenue generation, exceptional service earns that customer loyalty, it lends to repeat business and referrals and also strengthens that relationship between the company and the customers. And makes it easier to ramp up new business when we open cold starts or warm starts.", "We\u2019re now much more efficient at customer service than we have been in the past, able to handle greater inflow of business at lower cost. In March, we also streamlined our field platform under the leadership of Matt Flannery, an industry veteran with over 20 years of experience.", "We also continued to optimize our footprint by closing and consolidating seven locations in the first quarter without leaving any market. And our business development team is constantly reviewing market opportunities to expect to open some strategic cold and warm starts later this year plus do some selective consolidations. We also continue to repurpose our capital to serve the needs of our targeted customers. An example would be our fleet mix, less aerial, more earthmoving because that\u2019s what our customers need.", "So to summarize, our first quarter results were down year-over-year; we believe that we\u2019ve seen the lowest point in the cycle based on what we\u2019ve experienced in March and now what we\u2019re seeing in April. We\u2019re comfortable that the estimation to recovery will begin in the back half of 2010 and become more universal in 2011.", "The things that we are hearing and seeing in the field support this, we see positive signs, our branches are more optimistic in many trade areas. But more importantly, when we go out there and we talk to our customers, we\u2019re hearing that there\u2019s more bidding activity. It\u2019s competitive, but nonetheless there\u2019s more bidding activity. We\u2019re also in a great place to jump on opportunities presented by the recovery, not indiscriminately but where our efforts can bear the most fruit.", "Everything we just discussed today will be covered in more detail in our new investor presentation. However, we\u2019re doing something different this quarter, it\u2019s not posted on the website yet, it contains a lot of new information.", "However, we want to walk you through it and we\u2019re going to be introducing it this Thursday the 29th, we\u2019re going to webcast it 12:30 Eastern Time. And I urge all of you to join us so that we can walk through this together. We hope you find the information very valuable.", "Now with that I\u2019m going to pass it over to Bill to review our results and then we\u2019ll go into Q&A and we\u2019ll take your questions. Over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Mike. Good morning to everyone. As usual I\u2019ll give more detail on the numbers, but also hope to provide some more color on what made them up. We\u2019ll look at cost revenue and then we\u2019ll update our outlook before I finish up.", "So first turning to revenues, for our rental line of business, our rental revenue, as Mike mentioned was down 15% in the quarter and as you\u2019d expect, that revenue was really a story of rates, fleet size and fleet utilization. Mike touched on the rates, down 6.5% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis.", "But as you delve a little deeper there\u2019s some positive news there in that the year-over-year decline for each month of the quarter was less successively as you went through the quarter. So, March less of a decline then February less than January.", "We\u2019ve seen that momentum continue in April and are heartened by the fact that that is continuing and we hope that portends a better rate environment as we get further into the year.", "Looking forward, in fact, while we\u2019re not going to get too aggressive about -- talking about the rate impact that we\u2019ll see over the full year, we do think that we\u2019ll see a slight modest decline of rates overall for the full year. What we\u2019re talking about is something in the low single digits on a full year basis for rates this year compared to last.", "A bit more context on our fleet. Our fleet size during the year or during the quarter was down versus last year, down 6% at the end of the quarter. And obviously that was a positive in supporting utilization. Utilization, as Mike said was essentially flat. It was up actually 10th of a percentage point compared to the same quarter last year.", "As you look within that, well, the other interesting piece is that we\u2019re seeing some significant gains from certain categories. For example, the earthmoving categories were up significantly, earthmoving categories were up 6.5% on a year-over-year basis in time utilization. As we\u2019ve said before, that\u2019s an early cycle component of our portfolio and so we take that as positive news for utilization of the equipment.", "Turning to used equipment sales, revenues from used equipment this quarter were $35 million for our sales and as Mike mentioned. The margin was 31.4%, that\u2019s up 19.5 percentage points, compared to last year. And within that we\u2019re seeing, as Mike said, improvement in the prices that we realize in our used equipment sales, whether through our retail channel or through auction or other channels.", "That\u2019s good news. We certainly take that as positive news for where the market is overall. The mix of channels that we used this year was also very favorable, that was another significant part of that improvement in margin. So we sold 70% of our sales in the quarter through our own retail channels this year that compares to 34% through retail last year.", "Auction was 17% of our sales this quarter, compared to about 39% last year. So, that certainly was a positive contribution in addition to the improvement in underlying equipment prices.", "Earthmoving in particular was a better performing component of our used sales than other categories. For contractor supplies, another solid story for us even though the revenue was down materially, down 28% year-over-year, the gross margin improved very significantly. Gross margin was up 230 basis points for the quarter to just over 30% in our contractor supplies business.", "So we\u2019re continuing to execute the strategy that we\u2019ve talked about, focusing on the higher margin sales opportunity, making sure that the sales that we do do support our rental line of business and that\u2019s playing out to better margins in that line of business.", "Let me now turn to costs and touch on our SG&A performance for the quarter. We delivered $22 million of SG&A reduction for the quarter, compared to last year. And that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve been focused on for the last number of quarters. We\u2019re looking to take advantage of cost savings in every line of our SG&A and in this quarter virtually every line was, again, a save versus last year.", "Specifically salaries and benefits were a major component and they came down in line with a significant headcount reduction. Professional fees were down materially as well, they came down in line with our greater focus on being careful on where we engage professional service providers.", "Travel and entertainment came down as we focused more on what\u2019s the right travel and what\u2019s the right way to travel to drive savings there. We also saw a modest reduction in bad debt expense for the quarter. So all in all we feel very good about the SG&A performance, good enough in fact to raise our target for SG&A reduction this year to $40 to $50 million for the full year and that compares to our previous target of $25 to $35 million.", "Now because of some discrete items that we had in the quarter, we won\u2019t just annualize the $22 million save that we had in the first quarter. But we\u2019re very confident that we can deliver $40 to $50 million of SG&A reduction and as always, we continue to look for more opportunities.", "On our cost of rent excluding depreciation, that came down $19 million in the quarter and like SG&A we had contributions from most of the lines of our cost of rent. Salaries and benefits again in line with headcount was a significant contributor. But other areas such as R&M, facility costs were also down and we continue to look for opportunities to continue that momentum.", "As we streamline, as we automate, as we really drill into our rental processes we believe there are more opportunities available, things like the fast initiative that Mike mentioned to help optimize our logistics operation we think will contribute to our path on costs in our cost of rent lines.", "We feel comfortable with the outlook that we\u2019ve provided $70 to $90 million. Quite honestly we\u2019re focused on opportune -- greater opportunities there and hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to continue to deliver good results in those areas.", "Put it all together between revenue and cost and you see that we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $115 million for the quarter and that was at a margin of 21.4%. So none of us are satisfied with 21.4% EBITDA margin but for the first quarter, seasonally the weakest quarter and compared to last year we think that represents solid performance in the quarter.", "The EBITDA margin was only three-tenth of a percentage point down versus last year and obviously in light of a 15% rental revenue decline nearly 19%, total revenue decline, we\u2019ll claim that as solid performance and we\u2019ll continue to look to drive it.", "Turning to free cash flow, we generated $99 million of free cash flow for the quarter that included a $55 million cash tax refund that we received in March. That tax refund is consistent with the cash tax impact that we talked about in February.", "As we\u2019ve looked at that cash tax refund and some other tax planning strategies and changes in our estimate we now think that cash taxes will be a greater contribution to free cash flow than we had initially guided to. So it contributes to our increased outlook for free cash flow for the full year.", "We now expect a total of $200 to $225 million of free cash flow for the full year and that\u2019s up, compared to the $175 to $200 million that we gave in February. It\u2019s up primarily because of the SG&A cost reductions which were essentially all cash and with an improved view on what the cash tax benefit will be roughly $10 million more cash tax benefit than we were in February.", "A couple of thoughts on fleet, we continue to drive the fleet strategy, in terms of leveraging our fleet, the best way that we can. Transfers are a key component. We had $1.2 billion of transfers this quarter and that was about 33% of our overall fleet involved in our transfer activities over the quarter.", "When you look at our used sales activity, the age of what we sold from the fleet in our used sales this quarter was 75 months, again consistent with our strategy of selling the oldest fleet first. And within those sales about 60% of the sales were in aerial and reach forklift categories, categories that are lagging a little bit in terms of overall market performance.", "As I mentioned, on a year-over-year basis our overall fleet size is down 6% at the quarter end and this helped us achieve the essentially flat time utilization that we remarked earlier.", "In terms of rental CapEx, we spent $40 million gross in the quarter and we spent that money buying categories that we expect to perform well as we go forward. For instance we\u2019re buying high capacity reach forklifts, we\u2019re buying light towers, compressors, excavators and a host of gen rent and earthmoving products that help us focus on the earlier stage activity that we\u2019re starting to see.", "We\u2019re skewing our buy away from aerial products except for very specific categories that continue to see good demand. Importantly, among that $49 million of spend about $10 million in the quarter was spent for two specific strategic relationships that we have where we had identified needs with the customer that we spent into.", "And that reflects the approach that we\u2019re trying to take with our rental CapEx spend this year. We want to be targeted and focused in trying to support specific customer needs along with our general level of spending needed to keep the fleet fresh.", "Now just a couple of thoughts on our capital structure, last night you noted that we filed an update to our shelf registration and I must admit, I\u2019ve been surprised by the level of questions and energy that we\u2019ve gotten around that filing.", "Recall last year that we had initially filed a $1 billion shelf in the summertime. We drew down on that shelf in November for our issues of senior unsecured and our convert issue. It left us with a shelf that was about a little north of $300 million, that\u2019s not a usable level of shelf capacity from our perspective and so our filing last night was simply to push our shelf registration size back up to $1 billion.", "There\u2019s nothing specific, nothing concrete going on, we don\u2019t have a current plan to issue anything out of the shelf whether debt or equity and I just wanted to take some time to emphasize that point. It is housekeeping and we\u2019ll certainly continue to talk actively about what our thoughts are around the capital structure.", "In the quarter on the capital structure you\u2019ll note that we did redeem the 6.5% senior unsecureds in February that was $435 million of an issue that matured in 2012. So with that redemption our maturity debts are now essentially clear until 2013 when our ABL matures.", "During the quarter we also temporarily moved a large portion of our Canadian cash position down to the U.S. and we carried that intercompany loan position over the quarter end so that explains the significant decline in cash balance that you see on the balance sheet. It was roughly $160 million U.S. and obviously when we moved the cash into the U.S. we used it to pay down the ABL.", "Total debt at the end of the quarter was down by $245 million since the year end and our net debt was down by $96 million.", "On liquidity, we continue to have an exceptional liquidity position. We ended the quarter with about $800 million of total liquidity, that\u2019s made up of $713 million under our ABL facility and another $58 million of capacity under our accounts receivable facility. So continue to be well-positioned in terms of liquidity.", "Those are the key comments that I wanted to make for the quarter. Before we open it up for Q&A, I\u2019d just like to echo the sentiment of Mike\u2019s comments.", "We\u2019re seeing positive momentum in our business and indeed we\u2019re as optimistic as we\u2019ve been in quite some time. Obviously rates are still a challenge, but we\u2019re focusing on managing rates as actively as we can. The uptick that we\u2019ve seen in used equipment pricing, the strength that we\u2019re seeing in time utilization we think will give us a better basis for managing rate and managing our business overall.", "We\u2019re positioning ourselves to take full advantage of it. Too soon to say whether it\u2019s cyclical or seasonal but we certainly feel optimistic and we\u2019re going to go after the businesses as strongly as we can.", "So with that I\u2019ll stop and ask the Operator to open up the call for questions-and-answers. Operator?", " ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Henry Kirn of UBS.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Good morning, guys. [Henry] from Munich.", "Michael Kneeland", "How are you?", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Good. What was the weather impact to the first quarter?", "Michael Kneeland", "What was the weather impact, I mean, obviously\u2026", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Yes, is there any way to quantify it or?", "Michael Kneeland", "It\u2019s hard to break it apart, Henry. You just have to go through it and obviously it affected our time utilization, it affected our cost structure because you just can\u2019t remove cost out because you\u2019ve got snow or bad weather.", "But it\u2019s safe to say that across North America from the Mid-Atlantic all the way up through the Northeast we were impacted by weather. We saw a significant amount of rain and precipitation out on the West Coast as well. But it\u2019s very hard to break it apart and put your finger on it.", "William Plummer", "Yeah. Henry, it\u2019s Bill. I agree with Mike, it\u2019s hard to put a number on it. Qualitatively I guess the way I would say it is January and February were both softer than our forecast had and we update our forecast every month, as you might imagine, March was stronger. And so if you look at that pattern very clearly there was a weather impact. It\u2019s just hard to put a dollar number on it.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "That\u2019s helpful. And I guess on the industrial accounts that you\u2019re going after. Could you chat about maybe how the demand there is trending and maybe some of the internal progress that you made?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. And it\u2019s a great question. We continue to focus on it, Henry, as you know, when you look at the amount that we continue to sign more accounts. If you look on a year-over-year basis, in all of last year of all the national accounts that we signed 27% was industrial, in the first quarter 38% of what we signed were industrial.", "So we\u2019re, it\u2019s a long drawn out process, we go after it. We\u2019re seeing some uptick in some of the clients that we\u2019ve. Obviously petrochemical as oil prices continue to improve and just industry as a general rule continues to see some momentum, positive momentum. So we\u2019re seeing demand in our industrial side of the business and it\u2019s clearly a focus for us and its part of our national account program.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah.", "William Plummer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from [excuse me] from Philip Volpicelli.", "Philip Volpicelli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Thank you very much. Good morning, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Philip Volpicelli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "With regard to the time utilization, is that more of a function of you guys having right sized your fleet or I guess the industry having right sized fleets or is it a pickup in demand that allowed time utilization to be flat year-over-year?", "Michael Kneeland", "You hit the nail on the head. It is part, taking your fleet down and rightsizing it and we did that and we were proactive last year. And just to remind everybody on the phone call, last year we sold $650 million worth of OEC and going into this year and so that as part of it.", "The other part of it is, as Bill mentioned, demand that we saw in the first, January, February impacted by weather but our time utilization is improving. And inside of that there\u2019s some good color to look at. When you look at OEC on rent, the one area where we\u2019re seeing improvement is in earthmoving. Actually OEC, which has nothing to do with the size of your fleet, it\u2019s how much fleet you have out on rent, earthmoving is actually up on a year-over-year basis.", "William Plummer", "And actually our trench business is also up year over year in OEC on rent. And the other categories of our equipment, other than aerial are all either a little better or only slightly worse in terms of the percent OEC on rent year-over-year.", "Philip Volpicelli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Great. And that earthmoving equipment that\u2019s up year-over-year, is that regionally focused? You mentioned southeast and the Gulf Coast being stronger, is that, were that activity is happening?", "Michael Kneeland", "It\u2019s -- there are pockets in other regions but it\u2019s safe to say that, as you can imagine, there\u2019s going to be demand in Canada, there\u2019s going to be demand in the southeast on some of these projects, the Gulf, absolutely. And then there are some pockets in California, quite honestly, that are showing improvements as well.", "Philip Volpicelli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Great. And then in terms of your fleet plans for the rest of the year, is it a question of, you have to reach a certain utilization level for you to add fleet or are you going to continue to shrink the fleet in an effort to try to get rates positive?", "Michael Kneeland", "I\u2019m going to answer the first part and I\u2019m going to ask Bill to answer the second part. We basically said that we\u2019re going to reposition our fleet to serve a broader targeted customer base. As a result of that, we will continue to de-fleet aerial and we\u2019ll be specific in the areas of like 40 foot booms and smaller booms. We\u2019ll also de-fleet in the areas of 6K Reach Forklifts.", "Those are the areas that we\u2019ll continue to migrate away and then we\u2019ll add in more earthmoving in a broad range of earthmoving. The process that we go through and how we determine when do we add that, I\u2019m going to ask Bill to give you what his thoughts are and how we go about that.", "William Plummer", "Certainly. So as we look at opportunities to send fleet and I touched on it in my comments. There are two things that we\u2019re trying to serve. One is just the overall management of the fleet and to manage the fleet consistent with our notion that you can\u2019t starve the fleet, you\u2019ve got to feed the beast at least at a certain level even in very difficult environments like we\u2019re in today.", "And so there will be some general fleet spend to address, components of the fleet that are aging out and that need to be replaced. But we\u2019re also going to be focusing our spend on specific customer needs that fit with our strategy.", "So for large key accounts that are significant to our business today and going forward, if they have projects that have specific needs and we can\u2019t draw the fleet for those projects from our larger portfolio, then we\u2019ll look at spending money to support that. We did it in the first quarter for those two that I mentioned in my comments; we\u2019ll continue to try and support those specific needs with customers throughout the year.", "What does that mean? That means that we expect to be able to do that within the 102 to 2, excuse me $100 to $120 million of net rental CapEx that we have offered as our outlook. If we have more opportunities, we\u2019re not afraid to spend a little more as long as we can justify specific opportunities.", "Philip Volpicelli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Last question. The one and seven are potable back to the company in October. Do you plan to satisfy that put, assuming it comes to you with revolver or with free cash flow?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. Essentially, yeah,  six of one half a dozen of another. As we build free cash flow between now and then we\u2019ll use it to pay down the revolver. On the day of the put I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t have a large cash balance, I\u2019m sure what we\u2019ll do is just draw the revolver for $115 million or whatever the outstanding as.", "Philip Volpicelli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Emily Shanks of Barclays Capital.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Emily.", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "Good morning. It\u2019s actually [Matt Chin] for Emily this morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "All right.", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "Just a couple of housekeeping questions for you. Could you guys give me an exact number on the OEC after the $1 million?", "Michael Kneeland", "For the end of the quarter it was $3.741 billion and the average would be $3.750 billion.", "William Plummer", "And you just ruined Chris Brown\u2019s day, that\u2019s his one moment to shine.", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "I know, I apologize for front running him. And could you just clarify for me, again going back to the tax refund. And I know that on your last call in February you said the net cash tax was around $40 million and then you said you received a benefit of -- a tax benefit of $55 million in 1Q 2010. And then you said you were going to get probably a $10 million more increase is what you\u2019re baking in for your free cash flow guidance. Do I\u2019ve all those?", "William Plummer", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "Data points right? Okay. Great.", "William Plummer", "That\u2019s right.", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "And then the other thing I was noticing was your accounts receivable days seem to have ticked up a little bit year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Could you just give me a couple of drivers on what\u2019s causing this?", "William Plummer", "Obviously revenue\u2019s come down and so the denominator of that calculation is smaller and so that\u2019s a important part of it. We\u2019ve seen a little bit of extension in terms of the receivables that are outstanding, a little bit more relatively speaking going into the longer buckets as well. So, it\u2019s certainly not anything that we\u2019re overly concerned about.", "We monitor our position on a daily basis. We certainly will continue to do so and obviously we\u2019ll just have to flow with the seasonal patterns of our revenue, that was a significant part of the extension that you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter.", "I will add that as we look at write-offs of receivables there, the trend that we\u2019ve seen it through the first quarter is not at all out of line with what we\u2019ve seen previously. So, we continue to be very confident in our ability to collect and that\u2019s one of the great things about this industry. Our lien rights are such that we tend to get paid, sometimes it takes a little longer than we expected but we get paid.", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "Great. And then just one final question. I saw your comments in the 10-Q regarding your RP capacity, still look like you have any. Could you just quantify on the size and particularly where, what buckets those restrictions are coming in?", "William Plummer", "Certainly. So, there are two RP baskets that are important to us, the one that is the most significant issue right now is the limitation at the subordinated debt level. The basket calculation for our sub debt RP limitation right now is negative 500 and change, it\u2019s a big number.", "What that means of course is that we can\u2019t use operating company cash to go below the subordinated debt level of the op co, meaning we can\u2019t use op co cash to buyback stock, we can\u2019t use op co cash to buyback any of the debt of the outstanding hold co issues. So that\u2019s probably the most significant one.", "There is also an RP limitation within the senior unsubordinated debt of the op co and that basket is negative about $70 million or so as we speak and that\u2019s really only -- that\u2019s really only the result of the net losses that we\u2019ve experienced since we issued our issues last year. Does that make sense to you?", "Unidentified Analyst - Barclays Capital", "Perfect. Exactly what I\u2019m looking for. Thanks, guys.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC Capital.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Hey, good morning, guys. If we could just go back to Henry\u2019s question real quick. Is there any, can you give us any color, any drill down a little bit on March versus January, February, just as far as time utilization? Can you frame that with any numbers as to how much better it was in March versus January and February?", "William Plummer", "Give me one second, Seth. Let me see if I\u2019ve got the month breakdown here. So, I\u2019ll just give him the monthly numbers. For 2010 January our time ut was 54.6%, it bumped up a little bit in February to 55.2% and then it jumped to 58.4% in March. So, that gives you a sense of the pattern of the time utilization that we saw. Obviously, you\u2019d have to factor in the path of our fleet size during that period as well to get a sense of what the OEC was.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Right. But was, so that 58.4%, I mean that\u2019s got to be up more than the 0.1% year-over-year, correct?", "William Plummer", "Yes. It was.", "Michael Kneeland", "It was.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay. And you said that that\u2019s continued into April. So is April kind of North of 60, have a six handle in front of it?", "William Plummer", "I won\u2019t be specific about April, but April is continuing -- we\u2019re continuing the trend.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay. And did I hear correctly that you said rates were running flat year-over-year in April?", "Michael Kneeland", "That\u2019s correct. Essentially they\u2019re flat year-over-year.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay.", "William Plummer", "Sequentially.", "Michael Kneeland", "Sequentially from March to April they\u2019re essentially flat.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Sequentially.", "William Plummer", "Yeah.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay.", "William Plummer", "Sequentially.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Not year-over-year?", "Michael Kneeland", "That\u2019s correct.", "William Plummer", "Year-over-year over there.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay. A separate question. Can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re going to balance, as business gets better balancing your cost reduction initiatives versus adding sales staff, adding maintenance people to kind of keep the fleet working as your fleet is getting a little bit older here? How do you think about that?", "Michael Kneeland", "It\u2019s something that we -- it\u2019s ongoing and we think through it. Now, let me just tell you, there are several components of how revenue comes in. Rate doesn\u2019t really cost us anything, so there\u2019s no real cost associated with that other than paying some sort of a commission.", "With regards to the time utilization, as it improves -- our infrastructure is still solid, it\u2019s there, it\u2019s there to support the field that we have or the OEC that we have. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s not going to be challenges in specific areas. But we\u2019ve changed the process as well.", "I mentioned the workflow process. There are a lot of things that we\u2019re doing differently today than we\u2019ve done in the past that will change the outcome in the future. Those things still have to play out. Obviously if we start adding fleet, yeah, we\u2019re going to have to add more people as we go forward. But we still think we\u2019ve got a bandwidth here that we can clearly control and when you look at the cost that we\u2019ve taken out, we\u2019ve said that roughly 55% or more is going to be out permanently\u2026", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Right.", "Michael Kneeland", "\u2026 as we go forward. And obviously in SG&A, that\u2019s one that\u2019s going to fluctuate, it\u2019s going to fluctuate as revenues go up, sales expense will be there. Other things, there are inflationary factors around fuel could go up and have an impact.", "So, on balance we think that we\u2019ve got very good controls in place, our people understand it, our people buy into it and we\u2019re clearly focused after a more profitable customer. So that into itself would help drive the performance.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay. Have you noticed any uptick in maintenance costs on the fleet as it gets older here or do you feel like you still have some, you can age it another four or five months kind of thing?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. Our age is up on a year-over-year basis, that\u2019s correct. The percentage -- repair and maintenance as a percentage of OEC is flat. So, we are taking care of the equipment. We are monitoring it. We are making sure that it\u2019s repaired. So we haven\u2019t seen a significant increase in our repair and maintenance cost.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay. Last question. On the used equipment, is there any way to track, is a lot of that going overseas or is that staying here, the sales, do you think?", "Michael Kneeland", "The retail channel, most of it\u2019s here.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay.", "Michael Kneeland", "Obviously we -- the idea is we really want to push as much as we can through the retail because we get the highest margin there. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on and that\u2019s why we went out and we put -- we updated our website and that\u2019s why we also have a new program out there with financing to get people attracted towards it. So most of the sales that we\u2019ve retail -- 70% of our first quarter sales were retail were here.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay. So nothing, I mean, so there\u2019s a reason why that number shouldn\u2019t be sustainable? There\u2019s nothing unusual in the quarter?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. In terms of overseas shipment nothing unusual. But, I guess, I would caution against just a straight annualization of our used sales margin in the first quarter. We haven\u2019t been at these levels of margin for a couple of years and quite honestly, well over a year we haven\u2019t been at this level of retail -- the retail share of our used sales.", "So those mix factors had an important impact this quarter. As we go quarter to quarter throughout the course of the year we could sell a little bit more at auction, we could sell a little less at retail. That might impact the overall margin that we\u2019ll realize in used sales over the course of the entire year. So, don\u2019t just multiply it by four as the same margin.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Right. I mean, did the age of the fleet that you sold change materially from past quarters?", "William Plummer", "No, it\u2019s 75 months. And I think last year in the quarter it was 77 months or something like that.", "Michael Kneeland", "77.9.", "William Plummer", " It wasn\u2019t a significant change in the age of the fleet. So it was mix and price.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Okay.", "William Plummer", "And that will be the story as we go through the remainder of this year as well.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital", "Great. Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Hi, guys. Pretty good. Thanks. And \u2013 hi, guys. Nice work, by the way, good job. I\u2019m going to follow up on that last question because that margin jump up in used sales was impressive. And the $35 million in the quarter, I guess, the core question I want to get at here -- is that a reasonable run rate for what you might be selling for each of the quarters for the remainder of the year or might that pick up?", "I\u2019m just wondering if some of that what you selectively sold was just of a very higher margin and we would see that deteriorate on higher revenues of used sales going forward?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. No. Let me just say that going back to Bill\u2019s comment, we sold older assets. We weren\u2019t picking newer assets to sell. They are 75-month-old assets. Having said that, our goal is when you look at, when you go to auction you have to get it ready, you then have to transport it and then you also pay a commission on top of that to the auction house.", "We wanted to take a look at it and say is there a better way and a way we can expand retail? So we\u2019re pushing that through and we have some initiatives underway which I already described, that\u2019s one part.", "The other part is that we will ramp up our sales as we go forward and there\u2019s an expectation that we\u2019ll sell more fleet. Obviously as the seasonality comes on you would expect demand from people who want to buy something would increase. That being said, we still want to push it as much as we can through on the retail side.", "Push that all aside, we\u2019re not afraid to use auctions if need be in order for us to achieve what we want to achieve. But we\u2019re very happy with the signs that we\u2019ve seen and the reality of it is if you could look at the auction prices that are out there, those prices are improving as well.", "William Plummer", "And, Scott, I\u2019d only add, so the $35 million was a result of selling $77 million of OEC in the first quarter. That was down significantly from what we did first quarter last year but last year was an epic here in used sales. Our view is that we\u2019re going to have a more normalized used sales year this year, the quarters will breakout however the quarters breakout.", "We don\u2019t feel that we were overly selective in what we sold in the first quarter and as evidenced by the 75-month average age of what we sold. We\u2019ll continue to make decisions based on where the market is as to how much we sell in a given quarter and, in fact, the mix of what we sell in a given quarter and that\u2019s why I threw out the caution about don\u2019t just annualize the first quarter margin.", "As that mix changes, whether it\u2019s channel mix or product mix, we\u2019re going to have different margin results. But you can certainly look for us to sell a more normalized amount of used equipment over the course of the year. And it will just depend on what quarter we\u2019re in as to exact results that come out of used sales activity.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Great. Thanks for that color. Certainly reassuring. Along the same lines kind of flipping it. You mentioned these two specific customers in the quarter that you did spend a bit of CapEx on. I guess, the question here is, are these -- were these industrial long-term customers where, you know you will have utilization for a good long time? What or are you just serving a customer who\u2019s a big customer to keep them happy, just kind of the strategy, the rationalization there? Thanks.", "William Plummer", "It\u2019s all of the above. One was industrial, one was more construction related. In both cases they were very long-term commitments that we made to them and they made to us.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then another big question that you responded, Bill, you didn\u2019t know if it was cyclical or seasonal what you\u2019ve seen so far and that\u2019s fair given where we\u2019re in the year. At what time, at what point do you expect to see or expect to have more confirmation of which or both that it is and just, any thoughts on that topic? Because you sound very, very optimistic and just wondering if it might not just be a seasonal uptick and this could be a head fake, that\u2019s the root of the question?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. And that\u2019s the core question that we wrestle with every day. So, I would hope that when we\u2019re on this call 90 days from now, we\u2019ll be able to say, you know what, it certainly is seasonal but the seasonal was either helped by or hurt by the overall cycle -- point in the cycle that we\u2019re at. I would hope that we\u2019d have some more clarity after we got half the year in our pocket.", "And so that\u2019s sort of the timing where Bill Plummer at least will be making a judgment. But, we\u2019ll just play it however it plays out as aggressively as we can. That\u2019s the strategy we\u2019re taking.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah.", "William Plummer", "Certainly this is more of a seasonal uptick than we saw last year and that may not be saying a lot, but it is certainly more of a seasonal uptick if it\u2019s all seasonal. It\u2019s probably more of a seasonal uptick that we\u2019ve seen in a couple of years if it\u2019s all seasonal. So, maybe there\u2019s some cyclical component to it. Mike?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. I\u2019d just say, that you\u2019re right, everything that Bill said is right on. What we did do is we went out and we actually talked to customers. We wanted to get from them, what are they seeing, what are they experiencing. And these relationships go both ways, it\u2019s just a matter of sitting here and we got their business, we have to earn it every day. But it\u2019s more of a partnership that we try to focus every one of these single point of contacts.", "And we actually went out and we talked to customers and we asked them, what are you seeing? What are you experiencing out there? And they say there\u2019s more bidding activity. To Bill\u2019s point, I think in 90 days we\u2019ll have a better understanding of where things stand because of the weather that we had and we\u2019ll have better clarity.", "But it was refreshing to hear from our customers that the level of bidding activity they\u2019re seeing is increasing. Again as I mentioned in my opening statement, is that it is still competitive. But nonetheless there\u2019s more bidding activity.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks. Two more quickies and I\u2019ll hop off. Could you provide, you gave utilization in the monthly progression through the quarter? Could you offer that on pricing comps? I don\u2019t believe we heard that?", "And then also, any thought, this is a suggestion and a question, any thought to providing enhanced level of guidance next quarter on the assumption that you may have better visibility? Thanks very much for everything.", "William Plummer", "Yes, Scott, give him an inch and he\u2019ll take a yard. I\u2019d rather not, Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to. I\u2019d rather not go down the route of more detail of pricing data. Are you feeling generous today or no?", "Michael Kneeland", "Since we gave out the other one let\u2019s just -- it was down 8.1 in January, 6.9 in February and then 4.5.", "William Plummer", "Those are the year-over-year comparisons by month\u2026", "Michael Kneeland", "Right.", "William Plummer", "\u2026 for rate.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Great. Thanks.", "William Plummer", "And then, I\u2019m sorry, the question about guidance is one again that we talk about a lot. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate it every quarter and make a separate judgment. The reason we\u2019ve stuck with the approach that we\u2019ve is because of visibility.", "And we talked about it again over the course of the last few days. We decided that we didn\u2019t feel confident enough about visibility to be able to go to a more revenue and EBITDA focused guidance. And we\u2019ll make that assessment again as we get ready for the second quarter.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks.", "William Plummer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wells of Thompson Research.", "David Wells - Thompson Research", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. First off, I guess maybe a couple more questions just related to the rate outlook. Given what we saw later in Q4 of \u201809 where you saw your rental rates flat on a sequential basis. How does, if you look at that number relative to what you\u2019re seeing in the late March and early April timeframe? Are we still seeing drops from that or are we flattish with what we saw at the end of the year?", "William Plummer", "So, we did have a, I mean, when you look at sequential declines or we did have sequential declines in the first quarter. Each of the three months of the first quarter on a sequential basis were down. So we\u2019re down from that essentially flat level that we maintained from August through the end of December.", "David Wells - Thompson Research", "Okay. And I guess, I mean, starting, I guess in this quarter and in the second quarter to some extent, you start I guess coming into easier comps somewhat looking back to what we saw last year. Keeping that in mind, I mean, what does it takes for the industry as a whole to see some sort of pricing power return if, here we\u2019re, we\u2019re actually seeing a seasonal uplift in the construction season, which we probably didn\u2019t see to the same extent last year. Is it a matter of the players kind of being more rational collectively or is it a fleet size issue still or what are the puts and takes with regards to that?", "Michael Kneeland", "David, this is Mike. You know, I would say that in some pockets it\u2019s a fleet issue. I think that obviously discipline is part of it. I think the other part of it is the fact that, as I mentioned, sequentially what you want to see is the sequence of events, used prices, the time utilization and time utilization as it starts to improve.", "And as Bill mentioned, we saw it March, we see it continue into April. It has to play itself out probably for another 90 days or so for other companies to start thinking or plus other companies to think we can only talk about what we manage and how we focus. And we\u2019ve systems in place, we look at every deal, we\u2019ve got a hard stop, so we know when we go below a hard stop why, we\u2019ve that question.", "And so it\u2019s challenging, it\u2019s something that we manage every day. It\u2019s something that is near and dear to my heart and it\u2019s my number one priority to make sure because it\u2019s the biggest lever that we\u2019ve in the industry, as a company as well and focusing on that. And but I think time utilization overall as it begins to improve and there are going to be pockets, ups and downs across North America and as I said earlier, it\u2019s going to be a little choppy.", "David Wells - Thompson Research", "On the CapEx front, in terms of the categories of equipment that you\u2019re adding, are you moving up category in terms of particular size or capacity classes as you add in earthmoving equipment? And does that potentially create issues from a maintenance cost if you\u2019re getting into classes where you maybe don\u2019t have the same level of expertise that you would for smaller categories?", "William Plummer", "No. We\u2019re focused on the cat classes that we\u2019ve identified as the best opportunities for the market. We\u2019re reinforcing there. So, I don\u2019t think, I can\u2019t think of any circumstance where we\u2019ve gone somewhere where we haven\u2019t been before in our spend and we\u2019ll continue to think about it that way as we look at the rest of the year. We may emphasize some components but it won\u2019t be anything new.", "David Wells - Thompson Research", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I noticed in the Q that there were some hedges with regards to diesel fuel that were put in place. And maybe if you could kind of walk us through on your thinking with regards to that. And it looked like it wasn\u2019t necessarily a significant benefit in the quarter but is it more just kind of some housekeeping looking at the potentialities out there or is that a new program or a resuscitation of a previously existing program?", "William Plummer", "David, that\u2019s essentially how we\u2019re thinking about it. It\u2019s a new program. We\u2019re just looking down the road and asking ourselves where are the exposures that we\u2019ve on a commodity basis. We\u2019ve obviously over the last couple of years seen, at least at crude oil, the cycle blow up to almost $150 a barrel.", "And we just said, you know what, there\u2019s really not a lot of upside in carrying that fuel risk unhedged. So we put in place a program, it\u2019s roughly a quarter of our fuel exposure over the next two years that we\u2019ve covered so far. We\u2019ll continue to look at it and evaluate what\u2019s the right amount of cover to carry and we\u2019ll continue to report on it through the Q\u2019s but nothing unusual there.", "Operator", "Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to you, Mr. Kneeland, for closing remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. Just as a final reminder, as I mentioned at the end of my opening comments. Our investor presentation webcast is going to be on Thursday the 29th at 12.30 Eastern Time. We also set aside some time for Q&A as well on that call.", "So until then, if you have any additional questions on anything we discussed today, please give us a call here in Greenwich and we\u2019ll look forward to seeing you all or hearing from you on the 29th. Thank you very much.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, folks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded and is copyrighted by United Rentals Inc.", "Before we begin, the Company has asked me to remind you that many of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions will contain forward-looking statements. United Rental's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, any of which are beyond its control and consequently actual results may differ materially from those projected by any such forward-looking statements.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the company's fourth quarter and full year 2007 earnings release. For a fuller description of these and other possible uncertainties, please refer to the company's annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31st 2007, as well as to the subsequent filings with the SEC.", "You can access the company's press releases as well as its SEC filings on the company's web site at www.unitedrentals.com using the link captioned access Investor Relations.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances, or changes in expectations.", "During the conference call, references will be made to free cash flow and the EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term. Speaking today for United Rentals is; Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; and Marty Welch, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me is Marty Welch, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of senior management team. Now I will open the call today with two words, focus and plan. These two words are the heart of our message. They are the driving force behind the solid numbers we reported last night.", "Marty will go over the results with you in a minute, but first I'd like to pull back the curtain and full look at the powerful plan behind the results. Our strategy gets equal billing with our results today because we believe our record EPS for 2007, and our record EBITDA are just a beginning of what we can achieve.", "Last month on our guidance call, I spoke briefly about the strategic plan we initiated last June. Essentially we did a complete recalibration of the business to take the emphasis of top line growth and we place it with an overwriting objective of achieving profitable growth. It really was a fresh start for our company. Our new strategy calls for stringent cost controls, more profitable management of our equipment fleet, and a refocus on our core equipment rental business. This is absolutely the right strategy for our company.", "Equipment rental is what we do best, it is and always has been a high margin business for us. It's where we have numerous competitive advantages, including serving more than 900,000 customers each year. It's an important point because we are in a repeat business, where customer retention is key.", "Our employees know that they have to earn their business everyday and show our customers why we are better option on every rental. In 2007, 93% of our rental revenues came from existing customers. This year, I think it's fair to say that we are cautiously optimistic about our end-markets. We used a number of external sources for forecasting and they largely predict flat to modest growth in non-residential construction spending in 2008.", "We have our ear to the ground and we are hearing the same kind of things from our customers and our branch managers. That's on a national level. Regionally we are seeing some sizeable variations between markets. Demand for construction equipment in the Southeast and Southwest regions remained soft throughout 2007, and it looks like it will stay that way for at least the first half of 2008.", "South Florida and California are particularly weak. We are deliberately reducing our fleet levels in these areas. By contrast our Rocky Mountain region and both aerial regions realized the greatest year-over-year improvement in time utilization and the highest percentage of OEC on rent.", "We have good project diversity right now in aerial including long-term jobs and energy infrastructure, and the entertainment sectors. Our Gulf regions is another area where demand improved in 2007, and so far the Gulf seems to be on track for more of the same this year.", "Canada as a whole continues to be success story for us. Our Canadian business accounted for 11% of our rental revenues in 2007, which equates to 14% growth rate for the year on a constant currency basis. Western Canada is particularly strong which contributes to the performance of our Rocky Mountain and our Northwest regions. If we see the market begin to soften in 2008, we'll make adjustments, but right now all signs point towards continued strong demand in Western Canada.", "Now I want to mention residential construction since the subject always comes up on these calls. When home building is down as it is now, we feel it more sharply in California and our trench safety business. That was the case in 2007 and continues to be that case in our current quarter. But, overall residential construction accounts for only 10% of our business, so the effect is marginalized in most of our regions.", "Looking at our trench safety, pump and power segment, we achieved 2.8 percentage increase in revenues, and 25.6% operating margin. Now some of that came from cold starts, but the bigger picture is that our trench business, which gets most of its revenue from infrastructure projects was able to tap into more of this business in 2007, and we are expecting another year of moderate growth in this segment.", "While look at the full scope of our business, we are simply not seeing any signs of broad based slowdown yet. That said, we are watching the situation very closely, but everything we've heard and experienced up to this point tells us the construction experts are correct. We believe like they do, that non-residential construction will continue to show flat to moderate growth in 2008, and if it doesn't we are prepared to deal with that. We spent the last six months establishing excellent platform from, which we pursue profitable business at any market environment.", "Now I would like to take the next few minutes to give you some insight into our strategic process. We started early last year that's when we took a hard look at our business and decided we could do better. As you know United Rentals had an explosive first decade and a rapid rush at the top of our industry.", "Our primary focus was on driving growth and creating critical mass. Over the last several years we tried our hand at some revenue building initiatives like contractor supplies and became somewhat distracted from our core business. Our business model simply was not operating at full potential. To remedy that we put our entire operation under a microscope, nothing was off the table, when it was over, we knew exactly what had to be done to accelerate our earning power.", "We communicated that to our employees and gave them a target to take put our hands around. $500 million of incremental annual EBITDA within five years. We wanted our employees to see cost control and fleet management, and the rental business focus as mean to this end. This entire process involves some very difficult, but necessary decisions. We reduced our headcount by 1,100 employees which is about 9% of our workforce. We are in service business and we don't take workforce reduction lightly. We made the cuts with the full involvement of our fleet operators, and our corporate mangers.", "The people most knowledgeable of our customer expectations. Now as a result the process was largely invisible to our customers, service levels remains high and internally we maintained our standards for safety and quality of work. In fact, in 2007 was the safest year on record for our company with the lowest recordable rate in our history.", "We also undertook 360 degree optimization of our branch network. We evaluated all our branches every year, but this time our yardstick was reconfigured to EBITDA among other benchmarks. We closed 19 branches by the end of March, and put most of those assets to more profitable use, and we continue to watch for chronically weak links in our network.", "Our branch managers understand our goals. Last month, we introduced new compensation plans that align management incentives more closely with building shareholder value. These new comp plans are important reinforcement for the strategy that's already in place. In fact, we are tearing down the walls to constrain fleet utilizations.", "Our rental fleet will be managed as pull of asset available to drive all branches instead of all customers. Branch managers are looking now beyond their four walls to share equipment. Our sales people are no longer diverted to selling contractor suppliers, instead they are focus on growing our rental business. Our goal is to make these rentals as profitable as possible. We expect to loose about one point of rate this year, as the construction environment tightens, time utilization should more than offset any rate decline as it did this last year.", "In 2007, time utilization our larger fleet increased 2.5 percentage points to 64% for the year. Our rates decline by 1.1%. Let me tell you some of these actions we took to achieve these results. First we leveraged our technology and developed new analytics related to our fleet, this helped our districts and branches allocated implement to areas working, work harder for us.", "In 2007, on an average, we transferred 58% more fleet per quarter to branches in high demand, and areas where we are at high margins. For our current quarter, we are on pace to double our equipment transfers compared to 2007. Second we are very focused on turning equipment or around more quickly when it comes to our frame. We are not clearly as productive as we could be on this, but we made strides in certain areas. Our PM currency rate, which measures how much of our fleet is in compliance will required maintenance task, improved significantly and we are now running over 90%.", "A third way, we are managing our fleet is to CapEx allocations. We plan to buy about $630 million of fleet this year. This includes $100 million of growth capital for our strongest markets balanced by $85 million of defleeting and markets that don't justify their asset levels. In the past, our branch managers have submitted CapEx request on yearly basis. For 2008, we've moved to a quarterly system to allow us to respond more quickly to market opportunities.", "All of these activities are taking place in the field right now, with district over site and corporate support. Internally, we've got a dedicated team focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. Our SG&A ratio is under intense scrutiny. Out sourcing initiatives, which Marty will talk about in a minute has significantly brought down the price of non-fleet purchases over the past 16 months, and is on track for an estimate $23 million of incremental savings this year.", "We've made great moves, but this is just a beginning. Many of the gains we made in 2007 came late in year, when we have a lot on our plate with the service deal. Nevertheless we remain focused on our plan and we delivered one initiative after another.", "We emerged from 2007 as a stronger, more energized company with renewed emphasis on operations. We are running more efficient, more profitable business today. We are managing our fleet better. We are listening to our customers and responding to their needs. I can assure you that we will continue to execute this plan from this platform of strength for the foreseeable future.", "Now, before I ask Marty to review our financials, let me mention a couple of things. Our Board of Directors is currently fulfilling it fiduciary responsibility on two fronts. First, as noted in our earnings release, the Board is engaged an outside firm to perform a search for the CEO. This is clearly the right time to identify the best possible executive to lead United Rentals. I am pleased to be among the candidates on the consideration at the Board's request.", "Now, on a more fundamental issue of shareholder value, our company just came off an excellent year in a very good position. Nevertheless, our stock continues to be seriously undervalued by the market and the Board is considering all viable means of enhancing shareholder value. Regardless of any conclusions the Board may reach, the strategic focus of United Rentals remained on our equipment rental business. We are all on the same page on this. That being said, we don't intend to comment further on the Board activities on this call. So please keep that in mind when you ask your questions.", "And with that, I will now turn the microphone over to Marty for the financial review, and then we'll take some questions. Marty.", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you Michael and good morning everyone. Michael has discussed some of our highlights for this year, as well as the new strategy we put in place. This strategy which includes an intense focus on our core business of equipment rentals, more profitable management of our rental fleet and continued execution of our cost containment initiatives, contributed to our record fourth quarter and full year EPS and EBITDA performance in 2007. Looking forward to 2008, we expect the continued execution of this strategy to deliver another strong year.", "Now, I will discuss our results for the quarter and full year and review our outlook for 2008. Before I get into the details, let me say that my remarks this morning exclude the benefit related to the $100 million we received following the recent termination of our merger agreement with Cerberus. We are pleased with our progress on several fronts, which are focus areas for our business and yardsticks we use to objectively assess our effectiveness in executing our new strategy and delivering on our target to generate 500 million in incremental annual EBITDA within five years.", "First, equipment rentals, rental revenue increased 4.1% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year 2007, as improved time utilization on a larger fleet more than offset rental rate declines. For the full year, time utilization improved 250 basis points to a record 64%. Additionally, same store rental revenues increased 3.7% for the fourth quarter and 3.1% for the full year. Looking forward to 2008, we expect time utilization to improve another 200 basis points, again more than offsetting an expected 1% decline in rental rates.", "Second, SG&A, our SG&A rate improved 80 basis points to 16.2% for the fourth quarter and 90 basis points to 15.9% for the full year 2007. I will talk more about this in a moment, but our targeted SG&A rate which we think is achievable within five years is about 13%.", "Third, EBITDA. EBITDA increased 9.3% to a record $318 million for the fourth quarter and increased 8% to a record 1.17 billion for the full year. Additionally, our EBITDA margin improved 320 basis points to 34.2% for the fourth quarter, and 160 basis points to 31.4% for the full year. We expect continued expansion of our full year EBITDA margin in 2008, as we further improve time utilization, and continue to focus on rationalizing our cost structure.", "Now, looking at consolidated profitability, full year equipment rental gross margins of 38.7% decreased 20 basis points compared to the prior year, as the impact of increased rental costs and lower rates were only partially offset by improved time utilization. Looking forward to 2008, we expect our rental gross margins to improve about 70 basis points compared to 2007.", "Contractor supplies gross margin were 19% on the year, down 260 basis points compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects pricing pressure as well as a shift in mix as we sold a higher proportion of lower margin commodity type products in 2007, in line with our strategy to reduce our inventory levels. year-over-year, we have reduced our inventory levels by $37 million or 38%.", "For 2008, even though we expect total contractor supply sales to decrease by about 40%, our actual gross profit dollars will decline only modestly. This is because we expect our gross margins in this business to increase as we focus on higher margin products that are complementary to our core equipment rental business and further consolidate, and also we further consolidate our distribution network.", "Turning to used equipment sales. Our used equipment sales were down about 5% year-over-year and our gross margins declined by 300 basis points. The declining gross margin primarily reflects the sales of certain distressed and underutilized assets in the fourth quarter. For 2008, as we improve our fleet management, focus on maximizing cash flows over the life of an asset and more efficiently manage our CapEx budget, we expect used equipment sales to decline by about one-third.", "SG&A of $595 million was 15.9% of revenue for the year, an improvement of 90 basis points compared to 2006. On an absolute dollar basis, SG&A expenses actually decreased $18 million, reflecting reduced professional fees, the initial benefits of our cost savings initiatives and reduced incentive compensation. During the fourth quarter, SG&A of $151 million was 16.2% of revenue, an improvement of 80 basis points year-over-year, and on an absolute dollar basis, expenses declined by $9 million for the quarter.", "As Michael mentioned earlier, we put our operations under a microscope in 2007, and I am proud to say we emerged from that process with very specific plans to reduce our cost levels. I would like to spend a little time here to discuss those initiatives. We have a strategic sourcing initiative, which will lower our non-equipment related spent, a headcount reduction program, and other discrete projects, all of which are designed to reduce our cost.", "First, let me discuss SSI. We realized about $22 million of cumulative savings in 2007, and expect to realize an additional $23 million in 2008 and another $27 million in 2009. Let me give you an example. We recently renegotiated our network in long distance rates and consolidated them with one vendor. As part of this new plan, we will be upgrading our T-1 lines and still realized annual company-wide savings of about $2 million.", "Another example, we have implemented a new wireless program with our career, where we now pool all of our minutes and save about $24 per month on each of our thousands of wireless devices. Another example is our shipping spend. Our small package volume is over 600,000 packages a year. By consolidating the spend with one vendor, we were able to negotiate better rates and saved about $6 on each and every package set, representing about $3.6 million in the aggregate, and we also have better controls. Now, when our part suppliers send packages to our branches, they insist that they use our preferred vendor.", "I can go on, but the point is we are focused and recognized there is significant opportunity to leverage our non-equipment spend the way we have already leveraged our equipment spend. Of the $70 million of total SSI savings, about two-thirds relates to cost of goods sold and the balance relates to SG&A.", "In terms of headcount reductions, as Michael noted, we conducted an exhaustive review of our operations and reduced our workforce by 9% or about 1,100 people. And just as importantly, we eliminated these costs without impacting customer service. We expect this reduction to contribute about $55 million to $59 million of annual savings. Of this figure approximately 20% relates to SG&A and the balance will be reflected in the cost of goods sold.", "In terms of other cost saving initiatives, we have identified about 120 individual projects. In the aggregate, we expect these projects to deliver about $70 million in savings over the next three years. For each of these items, we have identified a project owner, who is accountable for delivering these savings, and a number of these actions have already taken place. For instance in 2007, we eliminated our corporate jet fleet, contributing over $2 million in annual savings.", "Other items include the in-sourcing of our SOX compliance work, eliminating our NHL sponsorship, and reducing our T&E spend by implementing better controls in spending limit. Of these initiatives, approximately 90% relates to SG&A and the balance to cost of goods sold.", "Looking forward to 2008, we expect both our SG&A rate and our absolute level of SG&A spend to continue to decline. Our forecast for 2008 reflects a reduction of over $15 million and the absolute level of SG&A spend at an SG&A rate of 15.3%, as we realized further savings from these cost cutting initiatives. Beyond next year, we are driving toward continued improvement in this area with target SG&A rate of about 13%.", "Our continuing operations diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.76 of on a share account of about a 114 million shares, compared with $2.28 on the same share count in 2006. These earnings which excluded the $.50 per share merger benefit represent an improvement of 21% versus 2006. We believe the strategy we outlined will further drive EPS expansion in 2008.", "Looking at our consolidated cash flow for the year, our 2007 cash flow from operations, which includes the $91 million merger termination benefit was $859 million, compared $834 million in 2006. Excluding this item, our year-over-year decline is largely the result of a $67 million increase in cash taxes paid as we burn through our federal NOLs.", "Turning to capital expenditures for the year, we invested $870 million in our rental fleet compared with $873 million in 2006. Our non-rental CapEx for the year was $120 million, $42 million increase versus last year. Excluding the merger benefit, free cash flow for the year was $151 million as compared to $235 million last year. The decline largely realized to the increasing cash taxes paid. In addition to achieving strong free cash flow during the year, our EBITDA margins also improved. Our EBITDA margin of 31.4% for the year represents a 160 basis point improvement versus 2006.", "Now let's take a movement to review the balance sheet. Total assets were $5.8 billion, including the net book value of our rental equipment of $2.8 billion. Our total debt, including the subordinator convertible debentures at year end 2007 was $2.7 billion essentially unchanged from the prior year end. Our net debt however, decreased by $248 million or about 10% reflecting our strong liquidity position.", "Our current borrowing capacity under our revolver and accounts receivable securitization facility is about $810 million. Now before we open up the call for Q&A, let me summarize our expectations for 2008.", "Our EPS range is $2.80 to $3 per share. This is based on anticipated full year diluted share count of the same 114 million shares. This range does not reflect any provision relating to regulatory issues and related matters.", "Our revenue EBITDA and free cash flow guidance is as follows; rental revenue growth of 3% to $2.71 billion and total revenue of $3.53 billion. Our rental revenue expectations reflecting an improvement in time utilization partially offset by 1% rate decline, virtually no growth capital and modest growth in our end-markets. EBITDA of $1.17 billion to $1.21 billion representing an EBITDA margin of about 33.7%. We are forecasting a tax rate of 38% and approximately $325 million to $375 million of free cash flow after investing about $715 million in CapEx.", "In terms of our free cash flow guidance, we are in a process of reviewing the potential opportunity associated with the bonus depreciation provisions of the recently passed federal stimulus package, and we will update you in that matter during our first quarter call.", "So that summarizes our outlook. And now I would like to turn it back to the operator, Chris if you could begin the Q&A session.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", ": Thank you very much sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment is from the line of Christina Woo with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Thanks so much for adding the color that you did on the call. I was wondering with regard to pricing you are expecting pricing to be down 1% year-over-year, why take the pricing decline instead of just adjusting your fleet mix to tighten the fleet a bit more and keep pricing at least constant if not up a bit?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Christina, this is Michael, we do our budgets from the ground up to all of our branches, in fact we are taking and we are defleeting in specific market areas the ones I outlined as weak, and we are shifting the capital around and... but its built from the ground up, keep in mind we are also looking at going from more to a monthly mix, a larger monthly mix expanding that and as you do that you actually get some price compression.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Actually can you give me a little more color on why you get the price compression shifting it to the monthly mix?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Because when you go for longer term contracts, if you can imagine larger projects --", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Especially in the industrial clients for example.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes industrial clients as well as larger projects you will get some pricing pressure on that. But, it's the right thing for the company that the contracts are out longer, there is less touch points so less cost control or less cost associated.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Right so what would you estimate then I know your revenue mix now is at 10% residential, maybe you got 20% in the infrastructure industrial type of work?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Right now the way in which we measure industrial, we measure industrial by SIC codes, so for actually doing business with a plant directly not building a plant or doing maintenance since or doing construction inside the plant.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Right.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Is running at 12% industrial, 10% is residential and the remainder would be related to non-residential construction.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "So for 2008, what do you see that revenue mix shifting to?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's really hard to predict, but we are going to be focusing more on industrial customers, because of our broad footprint. We think we see that as an opportunity for us, and really just going after our still... our larger accounts we have got a national counts program out there, and a lot of our larger counts are still seeing '08 equal to '07 and we are...we want to go after more of the share of the wall.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. What sort of estimates or what's your estimates assume in terms of the number of store locations for next year or 2008 versus '07 are you growing or shrinking location?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well it will be down on a year-over-year basis, so we just announced that we are taking 19 stores out of the first quarter. We have not announced any cold starts in our plan, we have we have no cold starts estimated it's not part of our strategy, that's not to say if there is an opportunity, we may do one our two, but the net number will come down.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. But, you have comfortable giving us any sense for the full year then what we can expect to see?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "It's too early to tell; as we go through the year we keep everybody updated.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Christina Woo - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you Ms. Woo. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Joel Tiss with Lehman Brothers. Your line is open.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Joel.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, Scott, I am standing in for Joel, had to step out, I apologize. Just quickly on the quarterly run rate for the pricing, how does that progress through the year?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "It went from the third quarter I believe it was 2.1, 2.2, if you hang on, one second I will pull the numbers up.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi, this is Chris Brown just responding to the rate question there. So they were down 1.7%, they were up 1.7% in the first quarter and down 1.2 in the second quarter, down 2% in the third quarter, and as we disclosed in our earnings release for the fourth quarter our rental rates were down 2.1% as Michael mentioned earlier. We are forecasting them to be down at 1% in '08.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then as far as SG&A margin, I know the longer-term goal as we get those to 13% and it looks like you add about 16% and in 2007 I mean are you kind of on a year-to-year progression, do you think this year is close to the 15 or is it 13.5, how do we get to that 13% margin build over the next five years, if you could just outline that for us?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I think we said we expect '08 to be about 53.The 13 is I think is a longer term goal and it will require us to have growth in our top line and it's unclear when there be a down turn here, so I would be uncomfortable say exactly when that's going to happen, but I definitely do think but we can see how accretive to that as I said over the next 5 years.", "Unidentified Analyst", ": Okay great. And then just lastly on the end-market. So you are looking for those flow throughout the year or you kind of think, don't hang in there throughout the whole year?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "We agree with the experts I mean we have double-digit growth throughout 2007, no one is projecting the end-market to grow and in fact we are actually seeing it come down and we are estimating somewhere between 3% to 4%.", "Unidentified Analyst", ": Thanks a lot.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", ": Thank you, Mr. Tiss. Our next question or comment is from the line of Matt Vitorioso Barclays Capital. Your line is open.", "Matthew Vitorioso - Barclays Capital", "Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some color on the used equipment market, I think you said you expected the sale of equipment for you guys to be down 35% in '08. Does that assume any deterioration in the prices for used equipment that you guys are getting?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "No, it's not that really just, our fleet management, our life cycle process, identifying the essence that we want to sell for the business. So that has nothing to do with the market. Relative to the market, over the last four months, prices did have come down, however, having said that the most recent report published by Ross Associates [ph] actually saw a slight uptick and a results that we have seen form the most recent auctions in Florida, have suggested the prices were actually better than expected.", "Matthew Vitorioso - Barclays Capital", "So then if utilization doesn't trended exactly how you'd like throughout the year, you could probably continue that kind of lower the size of the fleet by selling into that market?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Sure that's one of the levers we have in these businesses. If we see the market go down significantly, do we want labors we can fall, is sell our fleet, but as we stand right now in our projections we are very comfortable with our fleet sales.", "Matthew Vitorioso - Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And just to hit the pricing again I mean it clearly looks like its trending down through out '07, your assumption over 1% decline in '08 I guess that means you are expecting it to turn positive maybe in the second half or what's the expectations there?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well we don't give quarterly guidance on rates, but what I can tell you is there is markets where there's opportunity and we are going to expand in that area and we are going to defleeting in the markets where we seeing softness.", "Matthew Vitorioso - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And lastly just on the contractor supply business, it looks like you are going to be down to the four distributions centers by the second half of '08, I mean what's the longer term mean, is this business just, are you going to keep those four distributions centers, you think this business will be around in a couple of years or what do expect there?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well we are going down just the four distributions centers and we will recalibrate the business at that point, if in fact will probably we can drive some more efficiencies out of the business, we may take it down to one or two more. But, a real driver for the organization is not on contractor supplies. Our driver for the organization is focusing on our rental fleet and focusing on the rental business and that's going to be our main stay, that's where we are going to be focusing on as organization. And contractor supplies will be just an add-on, and will not be a significant portion of our business.", "Matthew Vitorioso - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question or comment is from the line of Chris Doherty [ph] with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Chris.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, Marty.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Mike.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sorry, Michael. A question for Marty, and I think you have already sort of spoke about this. You might have thrown a little kink in my question, but you mentioned deferred taxes, and potentially depreciation from a stimulus plan. Given that you plan to keep the fleet where it is or grow slightly, it actually seems to be down recently. What could we expect from the timing differences in depreciation? Do you expect to work through the differed tax increase on the balance sheet in this last quarter?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. What's happening is that we constantly have deferred taxes that are generated from new assets. Remember that even though we are not increasing the size of the fleet in '08, we are going to spend $700 million in CapEx. And so, those new assets will qualify for the bonus depreciation provisions in the stimulus act, which will give us a larger than normal, the tax to book depreciation advantage which will beef up deferred tax in '08 that we would not have otherwise expected.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then Michael, a question for you. In terms of rental rate, I know your largest customer if you sort of aggregated all the government agencies together would be your largest customer. Do you have long-term rental rates with them, or those market based?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "They are market based, but it is a... we have a contractual. Obviously, we have a GSA contract with them. It is market based, but we have a set formula that we work for them.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Alright. That's it. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Doherty. Our next question or comment is from the line from of Alvin Leo [ph] with Citigroup. Your line is open sir.", "David Raso - Citigroup", "Yes.Hi, it's actually David Raso here. Good morning. Quick question, in the channel, it seems, and correct me if I am wrong, that you are backing way a little bit from some of your at least within the mix of your historical fleet, your larger earthmoving equipment. Is that something I am picking up that's correct and I would think that might help alleviate some rental rate pressure for you, if... I mean you are running a big aerial fleet, but is there a conscious decision in '08 to move away from some of the larger earth moving, which might make your mix of rates better with how you're configuring the fleet?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well David, that is two things. One, we have on numerous calls been saying that we have been de-fleeting in that large arena. Yes, there is a lot of rate pressure that associates with the larger earthmoving equipment. We are going to be de-fleeting, but it's not going to be significantly. We did see about 2 percentage point decline in earthmoving, larger earthmoving on a year-over-year basis. Earthmoving is still going to be part of our product mix that we will offer, but we are not going to offer the large product mix that we've had in the past. It will be more of the smaller items.", "David Raso - Citigroup", "And when it comes to your rate projections for '08, can you give us a... I know it's a big generalization between all the portable compressors to earthmoving. But aerials versus non-aerials, when you look at our rate projection for the year?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "We would expect to see aerial actually improve slightly on the year-over-year basis, just due to the fact that time utilization has been so high.", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. David, this is Martin. The 1% write down that we are talking about is actually the sum of our 11 regions, and we have a certain areas where we are expecting 3% to 4% rate improvement and other areas where we are expecting more than 1% rate decline, and the 1% decline is the net of all that, as built up for the ground up.", "David Raso - Citigroup", "Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer [ph]. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hi Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets Corp", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Could guys talk a little bit about what you are seeing geography to geography, and I am kind of curious about Canada. We saw you had a positive on currency. How are things up in the oilsands? How big is that now? And then if you could just touch on the regions in where things may be stronger or weaker? Thanks.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Let me just start with the weakest area, is obviously in the Southeast in the Southwest. It comes down to really two states, Florida and California, as I mentioned earlier on the call. And when you take a look at the areas where you see pockets of strength, it's the Gulf, it's the Rocky Mountain, it is the Northwest, it's all of Canada. And then we are seeing improvements both in the Midwest and then also in the Northeast.", "The Southeast, you have got our Southeast region goes all the way up to the Maryland border, all the way down to the Florida, and Florida is a large market. But having said that, and to answer your question, there is still a significant upside in Canada, and Canada as a whole was really a tale of few stories. Historically, we saw the western half much stronger and the east was not as strong. However, having said that, the energy-related projects that we are seeing in the pickups, Canada will be strong for all of '08. And then Alberta talking about the Rocky.... tar sands projects there still about over $200 billion worth of work up there.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets Corp", "Okay, thanks. And then just metric, I don't know how you track it, but fleet downtime things that are coming upfront and the time that takes to get back out on rent. Do you track that can just give us an idea of how you are tracking relative to your particular goals there? Thanks.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we were, historically we were... last year we were at 11, we are now at 10.7, it's an improvement, but it's not where we wanted to be. We wanted to be at 9%. We are not there yet, and we'll march towards that.", "Scott Schneeberger - CIBC World Markets Corp", "All right, guys. Thanks a lot.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from the line of Philip Volpicelli with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Just with regard to the CEO search, is there a timeframe that must be completed by?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "I have no comment, I don't know how longer it will take, Philip, this is Michael. We just announced it, obviously, it will take some time regard to the candidates but that's really up to the board.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then with regard to the planning as laid out which sounds very good and attractive. What has been buy end from each of the different district leaders and is the managers of the branches?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "The direction of the organization is focusing on the rental business, as caution ally it went over, it is very positive. That's where all of us including myself, I have been in the industry since 1978. And rental was always our core business it's what we focused on. And that the other items such as new sales used sales was just an offshoot of our rental business. So it's really going back to our basics going back to what we know, and it has been received very positively throughout the field.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "That's great. In terms of the restricted payment capacity last call, I think you mentioned it was 970, and you had about $150 million of net income so are we at about a 1.50 billion now in terms of restricted payment capacity?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, this is Marty that's in the ballpark I wouldn't have said around $1 billion probably slightly above that and just to remind you that there are sub limits there are threshold payment levels contained in the indentures for our C and D preferred which would essentially limit payments to around a $100 million.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, meaning you have to take those out before you could access the total $10.50 billion or--", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No it would have to be some kind of an accommodation with the others of the C and D preferred.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And have you begun conversation if I remember correctly those are tightly held I mean you have begun conversations with them or is that's something that's in the in plans?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That is something that's in the preview of our board and I am sure they are working as diligently as they can to increase shareholder value.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Understood and then with regard to the class action law suit that have been filed. Can you give us any update on where we are in that process? I know you can't comment on the results, but have you guys started discovery, have you sorted negotiations with, where do we stand on that?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, we really don't comment to the level of the stages, I mean I think that the news, the cases are fairly new and as event occur that we think warrant disclosure would certainly do it.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then specifically with can you... I don't know if you are willing to do this or you want to do this, how bad the rate pressure was in your two weaker markets South Florida and California, can you just give it to us in numbers or just how much worse it was then what you saw what you recorded?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well we don't give that numbers out for other regions, we don't give that type of granularity out for various reasons obviously there are some competitors on the phone calls. We can take this offline.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", ": Thank you very much. Our next question or comment is from the line of Matthew Oronsky [ph] with Citigroup. Your line is open sir.", "Unidentified Analyst", ": My question is already answered. Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", ": Thank you sir. We have a follow-up question or comment from the line of Joel Tiss. Your line is open again sir.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Joel, how is it going?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good. All right, do you have any sort of target on your age fleet or anything that you can give us just the guidance and the direction say by the end of '08 or end of '09?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "End of '08, Joel, we plan on being an up 40 months. Historically, we have always said we are very comfortable between 35 and 45 and we don't, we are not going to move from that, we are very comfortable within that range, so obviously if the market was to go down, we can age it out further put 40 months is what we are projecting for '08.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, and to follow up on what David was asking about before, can you talk a little bit about what are the sources of strength in the area work platform business, what are some of the end mark that you would highlights that are driving the strength in that business for the next twelve months?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "While the energy sector is very active. Larger projects, the entertainment industry, casinos, stadiums, large projects also some manufacturing, we have some manufacturing coming in from foreign investment. Those are the likely projects that we... large projects that we are actively on.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And are you seeing any trend changes on the municipal side, it seems that the municipalities are having a little bit more difficulty raising funds and maybe collecting as higher level of taxes as they were recently. Are you seeing any trends there that you can talk about?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "No, we haven't seen any, the latest report I saw from the government was projecting the infrastructures spending in that space to be up about 2.8 percentage points.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And last, can you give us some maybe like body language I would say on the CapEx because now you have added in this flexibility, and maybe you are going in a monthly ordering or quarterly ordering. And could you just give us any sense you are leaning toward, beating your CapEx, but spending more or spending less than where you are more on that not asking for forecast just sort of like body language a little bit, flexing with what's happening in the end market? Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think what the Marty said, on the raise also goes back to the comment on CapEx. We build on ground offering that's with all the branches; they are projecting the anticipated work levels. We are probably seen movements with inside the company or we are not going to see a significant movement of for our CapEx other than we projected.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Phil.", "Philip Gresh - JP Morgan", "Hey, guys. Quick question on the used equipment sales, can you talked about sales of distressed assets in the fourth quarter. So it is pretty margin there. How much did that affect the quarter and what you are looking at your margin in that business in '08?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. The decline in the fourth quarter year-over-year was entirely due to our stepping up to some distressed assets that we had. If you were to strip those sales out we would had a used margin rate that was comparable to our trend line. And as Michael mentioned we don't expect to see deterioration in that margin. We are moving forward to manage our fleet in accordance with our age and condition requirements.", "Philip Gresh - JP Morgan", "Okay. So you think you are pretty much through that that sales of distressed assets at this point?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You know, we continuously look at our fleet, but I think we were doing kind of special effort there at year end.", "Philip Gresh - JP Morgan", "Okay. And then just interims of the 500 million in incremental EBITDA over five years, appreciate the additional color in the cost side, but in '08 it looks like there going to be 20 million or so incremental according to your guidance. I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about maybe the trajectory that and how much was that based on cost cutting versus revenue growth etcetera?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.I think it's more than 20 million in '08. But the labor savings and loan is worth 50 million, but the point is that there is another price increases that we constantly face that are netted against that. I think directionally of the 500 million, roughly half of that we would kind of view as under our control, specific cost cutting initiatives that we have, and the remainder of it is going to require some top line growth and which we would then continue to maintain our cost at a controlled level and realized the reduction in rate as a result.", "Philip Gresh - JP Morgan", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Ana Recinos with UBS. Your line is open.", "Ana Carolina Recinos - UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, how are you?", "Martin E. Welch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "How are you?", "Ana Carolina Recinos - UBS", "Fine, how are you?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "Ana Carolina Recinos - UBS", "One last question I guess on the CapEx, just wondering, what types of price increases are declines you are expecting to pay on your new equipment purchases this year?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Each year our fleet management team negotiates vigorously with our vendors. We are projecting this year, our prices to be flat on a year-over-year basis.", "Ana Carolina Recinos - UBS", "And what was the number last year?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "That was up about two points.", "Ana Carolina Recinos - UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", ": Thank you. Our final question or comment comes from the line of Seth Weber with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America Securities", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America Securities", "Just real quick, on the used equipment, I am going back to that, have you guys started to exploit the opportunity of selling used equipment overseas or into some of the emerging markets and if not is that something that you think could hit the rate over this year?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well Seth, this is Mike. We participate in that arena through the auction houses. They are clearly set up for that, they do advertising across all of the other markets that you just mentioned. And that was the result of we saw the activity at Ritchie Auction and the out sign [ph] auction, the large auction down in Florida, where there was a tremendous amount of foreign investment and foreign buyers. So we really leave it up them. That's their strength and I'll go back to say what I said earlier. We are a rental company and we really need to focus on our rental and those experts who can sell the equipment that's what we are going to leave up to them to do.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America Securities", "Okay and would you say, just unbalanced that there is more tolerance to take older equipment in those markets I mean if you have a view on it?", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Well what I can tell you is the results that we have seen out of the most recent auction, where as we anticipated that the prices are actually came in much better than we anticipated. I mean a large impact of that was the influx of foreign buyers.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", ": Thank you very much. I would like to turn the presentation back over to Mr. Kneeland for any closing remarks.", "Michael J. Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, operator. Before we close, I want to leave you with this thought. In my 10 years at United Rentals I have seen firsthand how this company can do anything it sets its mind too. We have great people in place with our braches, and we have a powerful plan regarding our progress. We know we can capitalize and substantial upsize to our business in any market environment by making continued improvements in our cost structure and by harnessing the full earning power of the largest equipment rental fleet in North America. As we stand hear today we have excellent momentum and results to show for it. And you can expect this year more good news from us as the year progresses. So I want to close off by saying thank you for participating in this call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We again thank you or your participation.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, Operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me is Marty Welch, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team.", " ", "I want to open today\u2019s call by saying how pleased we were to announce the election of Jenne Britell as Chairman of our Board of Directors earlier this month. Jenne has been an invaluable member of our Board since 2006. I can say with certainty, that she shares our excitement about the future of United Rentals, and I look forward to working closely with her as we move forward.", "We would like to discuss with you this morning, starting with our recent share repurchases and our second quarter results. Marty will cover both of these topics in detail with you in the call. I also want to address our strategy in operating environment, specifically what the second quarter told us about our end markets and how they may perform in the balance of 2008.", "But first, let\u2019s start with the repurchases. As you know, in June we repurchased all of our outstanding C and D preferred stock in preparation for launching a tender offer. We have now completed the tender and brought back 27 million shares of common stock at a price of $22 per share. These repurchases give us greater flexibility in many respects earning the best interest of our company and shareholders. The net result is, that with the share repurchases complete, we expect the company\u2019s fully diluted share count to decrease by approximately 39% to 70 million shares in 2009.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our operating results for the second quarter. And we continue to focus on driving profitable growth in our core rental business, managing our fleet and controlling our costs.", "The construction [stocks] environment which was robust at the start of the year began to falter in the second quarter, impacting our topline numbers. Rental revenue was $620 million, down about 6% year-over-year, due primarily to a 1.4% decline in rental rates and a 0.8 percentage point decline in time utilization.", "Total revenue was $831 million, down 13.6% year-over-year. Our decision to de-emphasize our contractor supplies business in favor of more profitable revenue [for] our top line down by about $52 million in the quarter as we expected.", "Our pro forma EBITDA of $266 million for the quarter tracked about 10% less than last year. However, our pro forma EBITDA margin grew 1.3 percentage points to 32%. So even though our revenues were down, we operated our business more profitably. Our stronger EBITDA margin is a sign that our strategy is working and that right dynamics are in place. Let me give you a few examples:", "On the sourcing side alone, we saved incremental $8 million in non-rental purchases through the first six months. We've targeted about $20 million incremental savings this year, which will give us about $40 million in savings towards our goal of $70 million by the end of 2009.", "We\u2019re operating at the business more efficiently, with a workforce that is down by 1787 FTEs at the end of June 30. That\u2019s 15% lower than last year, and we managed the adjustment without impacting our customer service.", "Our contractor supply business has been retooled to be a support function for our rental operations and is on track to become more profitable. Contractor supplies generated 24% gross margin in the second quarter.", "Our fleet management initiatives are hitting their stride. Fleet transfers are mechanisms we use to enhance customer service, and we purpose our capital. In the second quarter, transfers were four times higher than 2007 on OEC basis. While our OEC was up slightly, our fleet was basically flat on a unit basis as of June 30, and we expect to sell off more of our older assets between now and year end. ", "We\u2019ve already adjusted our fleet plan to slow down our spending rental CapEx by $167 million versus last year, leading to a $269 million improvement in free cash year-to date. We've a lot of additional flexibility to CapEx and we won\u2019t hesitate to exercise it if we need to.", "Now our decision to slow CapEx spending was triggered in part by our operating environment. We believe that the back-end of 2008 will be weaker than the first six months, particularly for non-residential construction. This is supported by several key industry forecasts, as well as our own market intelligence.", "Now I\u2019d like to share some of that information with you. We had some disappointments in the second quarter. A large number of our large projects were delayed in our Aerial East region in our Canadian markets. Our performance in Aerial East in particular fell short of its plan, based on its timing. And we\u2019re seeing some large parts come back on stream there. In addition, a few regional economies have been affected by the housing slump, particularly in the northwest, southwest and Florida. And we had some weather delays in the Gulf which impacted our quarter.", "By contrast, Aerial East and Midwest were bright spots for us, with the infrastructure projects; and our Rocky Mountain region which stretches from Arizona to Alberta is continuing to turn in some strong numbers. We continue to deliver on our promise to weed out underperforming branches, closing another six locations in the second quarter, which makes 29 so far this year.", "Now in terms of our customer base, our national class program\u2019s on the front burner, including the industrial accounts factor. Our size and scope gives us a competitive advantage with large accounts and we know from experience that these customers are capable of delivering long-term profitability. And that gives you a view of the inside in United Rentals. Now I want to share what we\u2019re seeing on a macro level.", "While non-residential construction spending year-over-year was up in the quarter overall, indications are that the construction starts have declined. The Dodge forecast estimates non-residential starts at $57.1 billion in the second quarter, a decrease of nearly 14% from last year. Our own customers are telling us that while they currently have work on the books; the landscape is becoming more competitive as fewer projects are being put out to bid. We watch these leading indicators very closely and very carefully, and the second quarter was a definite cautious sign for our industry.", "As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are seeing the start of what will be a slow but steady downturn to the balance of 2008. The turning point came earlier than anticipated, but the scenario is exactly what we've been preparing for since late last year. We expect 2009 to continue to be challenging, and we have a lot of levers that we can pull if the environment worsens. They include, further reducing our CapEx, increasing our used equipment sales, aging our fleet by several months on average while staying within our optimum range to 35 to 45 months, and in addition, we have the option of making further adjustments to our headcount branch network.", "The net result is that we're in a strong position to weather the cycles in our end markets. The updated guidance we released last night based on our share repurchases is for full year pro forma earnings per share in a range of $3.15 to $3.25. This assumes a 1.5% decline of rental rates for the year and a slight decline in time utilization. Operationally, this outlook ties to our previous guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 per share. So you can see that it is entirely with our rationale for doing these share repurchases.", "As far as other elements of our guidance, it's important to remember that our pro forma EBITDA range remains unchanged at $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion, and our free cash flow is expected to be strong at $350 million to $400 million, and we intend to use some of that cash to pay down debt. The important thing is, nothing about 2008 has taken us by surprise. We've made dramatic moves over the past year to prepare for exactly this kind of macro environment, and we continue to be vigilant and proactive. ", "Instead of pulling in our horns, our focus has been turned outward on driving EBITDA and incremental gains of EBITDA margins and free cash flow. Our business model is capable of delivering profitable growth even when revenues are down, and our strategy is now well established with a relatively short but solid track record with plenty of upside untapped.", "As we move to what is historically our strongest quarter, we intend to use as many operating levers at our disposal to continue to build [singular] value for our shareholders.", "Now before I turn the microphone over to Marty, I want to officially welcome Joe Dixon, who recently joined us as Vice President Sales as part of our initiative to improve our sales force effectiveness. You may know Joe from Hertz and Home Depot, but most recently at JLG where was in charge of global services. We're very pleased to have someone of Joe's caliber and industry experience to head our sales organization.", "And with that, I'll ask Marty to go in to more detail with our share repurchases and second quarter numbers. And then we'll go into Q&A and we'll take questions. Marty?", "Marty Welch", "Thank you Michael and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Michael's discussed some of our highlights for the quarter, and now I'd like to get into some of the details of the recently completed share repurchases, and our second quarter performance including the progress we are making on our cost saving initiatives, and then I'll review the outlook for the year.", "First, the share repurchases. As Michael mentioned, in the second quarter we repurchased all of our outstanding Series C and D preferred stock for $679 million. The removal of the preferred stock from our capital structure was a necessary step in proceeding with the tender offer, and will give us greater flexibility going forward.", "The preferred stock repurchase was funded with $254 million of cash and the issuance of $425 million principal amount of new 14% HoldCo notes due 2014. It's important to point out that the reason we issued the HoldCo notes was not for liquidity reasons. Rather, we were careful to protect the restricted payments basket contained in the indentures for our existing notes which have very attractive low coupon rates.", "I should also point out that the most important feature of the new 14% HoldCo notes is that there is no call protection, which means we can prepay them at any time without penalty. In fact, as we pointed out in our earnings release last night, we've already given notice of our intent to repay 125 million of these notes at the end of the third quarter. After this payment, the restricted payment basket will be approximately $200 million.", "Our tender offer closed and funded last week. In the tender, we repurchased 27.16 million of our common stock at a price of $22 per share for a total cost of $598 million. The tender offer was funded primarily through borrowings under our new $1.25 billion ABL facility and our existing accounts receivable securitization facility.", "Now let me discuss what these transactions mean in terms of leverage and accretion. First, with respect to leverage, since the company's inception, on a debt-to-EBITDA basis, United Rentals has operated at an average leverage ratio of 3.4 times. Following the completion of the tender, we're at 3.1 times, and we expect the ratio to be 2.9 times by year end, a level that is within our comfort zone. This means that the share repurchases have added less than one turn of leverage as compared to our pre-repurchase ratio of 2.3 times, and significantly below the historic high for the company of 5 times.", "From an accretion perspective, the repurchase of the common and preferred shares will reduce our 2009 fully diluted share account by about 39% to 70 million shares. And as Michael mentioned and as our outlook for 2008 illustrates, these repurchases represent an opportunity for us to achieve significantly more accretion and to capture it more quickly than through any other means.", "Before I turn to our second quarter performance, let me just touch on one more point. We've consistently talked about how this business can generate significant free cash flow in any environment. Our ability is secure financing under the ABL, the size we did - 1.25 billion at attractive prices and in the middle of one of the most challenging credit markets seen in recent history, is a testament to the resilience of our business model and to the credibility of the strategy we have put in place.", "I'd like to turn next to the second quarter performance. First let's talk about equipment rentals. Our rental revenue decreased 6%, reflecting a decline of 1.4% in rental rates and 0.8% in time utilization. The balance of the decline primarily relates to a shift in mix towards monthly contracts.", "Second, our SG&A of $126 million was 15.2% of revenue for the quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to 2007, reflecting lower rental revenue and the ongoing benefits of our cost-saving initiatives. On an absolute dollar basis, SG&A decreased by $21 million.", "Third; earnings per share. On a pro forma basis, our EPS for the quarter was $0.62 on a share count of 97 million, compared with $0.60 on a share count of 115 million shares in 2007, and a GAAP loss per share of $2.33. Our pro forma EPS essentially adjusts our GAAP EPS to reflect our new capital structure and to exclude the impact of the $14 million provision relating to the SEC inquiry.", "As I discussed earlier, the share repurchase will reduce our 2009 share count by about 39%. For these reasons, we believe pro forma EPS is a meaningful measure of our future profitability. And finally; EBITDA. Pro forma EBITDA margin, which excludes the impact of the SEC provision, increased 130 basis points to 32%, reflecting the success of our cost initiatives.", "Turning to our contractor supplies business; our second quarter contractor supplies margin of 23.7% improved 390 basis points versus the prior year. These results are consistent with our strategy of repositioning the supplies business and reducing the number of SKUs, especially in lower-margin commodity categories.", "In terms of our cost saving initiatives and in line with our goal of generating $500 million of incremental annual EBITDA within five years, we believe we can generate about $200 million of that improvement from the execution of our cost saving plans.", "During the second quarter, where we saw a pro forma EBITDA margin improve 130 basis points, we realized $34 million in cost savings. These savings came from a number of initiatives including our strategic sourcing initiative and our headcount reductions. To put it in perspective, our work force at June 30, 2008 is lower by about 1800 FTEs, which is the equivalent of 15% of our work force, as compared to last year at this time. And importantly, we believe these reductions remain without impacting customer service.", "Now let's take a moment to review our expectations for 2008. Our pro forma EPS range is $3.15 to $3.25, reflecting the benefits of a lower share count. From an operational perspective, this outlook is in line with our previous guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 per share. ", "Our revenue EBITDA and free cash flow guidance is as follows: We expect total revenue of between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, including rental revenue of about $2.5 billion. Our pro forma EBITDA guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion is unchanged, and represents a pro forma EBITDA margin of 34.1%.", "We're forecasting a full year tax rate before discrete items of about 37.6%, and approximately $350 million to $400 million of free cash flow. We were pleased with our DSO performance, which has improved from 53.9 days in the prior period to 53.1 days currently. Our free cash flow guidance which reflects total CapEx of about $715 million has decreased by about $50 million, primarily because of additional interest expense following the share repurchases.", "That summarizes our outlook. And now we'd like to turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A session. Chris, if you can start the Q&A.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). And our first question or comment comes from the line of Manish Somaiya with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Good morning, Marty and Michael and everyone else. Couple of questions. Michael, you talked about a mixed shift in the second quarter to more monthly rates which resulted in lower rental revenue. Is that something we're likely to see in the second half as well?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well the lower rental revenue was caused by timing. We did shift away from our -- we're doing more, monthly business is up one percentage point, so that's almost 68% of our revenue, it's generated -- our transactions are monthly. We will continue to see the trend go towards monthly revenue transactions, but the real significant second quarter does two things, I'll give you two data points, Manish: One was timing of our projects as I stated, and also continuous decline that we saw in the weaker markets, particularly in Florida and California. If you will take those two states away, in fact our rental revenue would have only saw a decline of 2.7%.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "I see. So basically what you're implying is that markets in Florida and California are actually getting worse. They haven't stabilized.", "Michael Kneeland", "Through the second quarter they got worse on a year-over-year basis, yes; however, we are starting to see at this point in time kind of level off. Still early to tell yet.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Okay, fair enough. And then just secondly, on EBITDA, I mean I have been looking at the EBITDA distribution first half versus second half. Generally the second half has accounted for about 60% of full year EBITDA. Obviously with visibility what it is, and your guidance implies that you'll do about 60% of your EBITDA in the second half, how are you getting comfortable with that?", "Marty Welch", "Manish, this is Marty. The third quarter and into October is always the busiest part of the year for United Rentals. So there is some seasonality in the business. We've got pretty good visibility to the third quarter at this point, and so I think we are comfortable in essentially reaffirming the guidance that we had put out previously.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Okay. And then just lastly, update on my used equipment prices, any changes since you last spoke on it?", "Michael Kneeland", "Manish this is Mike again. We see actually improved margins in our retail sector where we're selling or where we have seen some declines is in the auction arena, and that's mostly around the earth-moving equipment. But by and large when you take a look at the general survey put out by [Ralphs], I think last month it was only down about 0.6 and about 1.5% full year.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Okay. I appreciate. Thank you so much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our next question or comment is from the line of Matt Vitorioso with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Matt.", "Matt Vitorioso - Barclays", "Hi, good morning. Just wondering if you could comment on the fact that you kept the fleet size basically flat as far as the number of units, despite the slowdown in utilization? Did the slowdown in utilization catch you by surprise, and will you just compensate for that by, like you said selling off more used equipment in the second half or just some more color on that would be helpful.", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. We target the level of CapEx to begin with - of the 2007 - again the 2007 going into 2008; and we anticipated a decline towards the back half of the year. As I said earlier, there was a timing issue, we review our needs very carefully and we believe that the level of capital investment that we have right now is prudent and obviously it's an operating lever that we can pull. But during the back half of the year, we will continue to sell older fleet and more of it.", "Matt Vitorioso - Barclays", "Okay. And then just on the free cash flow and the possibility of debt repayment. Is it safe to assume that for the time being any free cash flow will be used to help reduce the level of those 14% at the HoldCo, would there be any [OpCo] debt repayment ahead of those 14?", "Marty Welch", "Mike, this is Marty. The 14% debt is a priority for us, because of obviously of the cost. I think that if we have short-term free cash flow the ABL is a 100% revolver and we can very easily pay down the ABL and reborrow as we need. The decision to repay the HoldCo notes is a more significant decision because it's permanent and it also affects the restricted payment basket. So, we will take that in a more measured way as we feel comfortable that we have the ability to do it. By the way, we've mapped out over the next few years, and we're very comfortable that we can fully pay off the HoldCo notes in the next four years or so, without any additional refinancing just from operations.", "Matt Vitorioso - Barclays", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Our next question or comment is from the line of [Henry Turn] with UBS. Your line is open.", "Marty Welch", "Hi Henry.", "Henry Turn - UBS", "Good morning guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Henry Turn - UBS", "Quick question on the competitive response to the weaker markets. Have you seen anything different out of your competitors? How has the landscape changed?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, the landscape obviously has become more competitive in specific markets. I mentioned two of those in Florida and California. I don't comment on what the competitors -- they will announce their own rates and what they're doing as far as new business mode. But what we're hearing from our sales reps and from our customers, they're being very responsive. Are there pockets where we see some competitive nature? Absolutely. But I think that overall the industry is acting prudent right now. They're taking down their fleets and doing the right things.", "Henry Turn - UBS", "Okay. And on the shift in mix to the monthly contracts. How does that affect your ability to plan the fleet going forward?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, we plan our fleet -- we review our fleet quarterly. And towards the -- in the fourth quarter we do a deep dive all the way down to branch level and build our way up. It's with the input from all of our branches or branch managers, sales rep, customer input, but really the driver is our customers. What type of jobs are they seeing? What type of equipment will they require as we go forward? So it's very much a ground-up approach. So it's too early to tell. But we continually shift our fleet and I think that the biggest data point is our ability to shift fleet today between our branches and districts which, I'm happy to report, is up four times over the last year this time.", "Henry Turn - UBS", "Thanks. And if can just squeeze one more in here, a quick modeling question on the share count for the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Is it possible to give a little bit of guidance around what the third quarter share count might wind up being?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. I'm going to ask [Chris Brown], Vice President and Assistant Controller to answer that.", "Chris Brown", "Sure. In terms of for Q3 we're forecasting a GAAP in the pro forma share count of 70 million shares. The GAAP in the pro forma share counts are the same as the preferred securities are excluded from the GAAP share count and no adjustments necessary. The 5 million difference between Q3 and Q4, essentially weights to the weighted average impact of the tender which closed in mid-July.", "Henry Turn - UBS", "Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). Our next question or comment is from the line of ", "Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, sir.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks, good morning guys. Just focusing a little bit more on pricing, I think you guys answered this in a different way, but can I ask it in the sense of how much of the percent drop year-over-year in pricing was competitive versus some of the other drivers?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, again I can't report on what the competitors will report coming out, but there's two factors, one of which is we're going after monthly and longer term which comes down - will affect our price. And then we have seen some competitive pressure in specifically the markets where we see a significant decline. But to answer your question directly, it's very hard, because we don't have that type of information.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Fair enough. Now you had mentioned, I think and correct me if I'm wrong, 68% of revenue is now monthly transactions?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. And can you just give us, kind of how does that compare historically and then maybe year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, on a quarter-over-quarter from '07 it's up 1.4 percentage points. ", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay.", "Michael Kneeland", "If you want more detail, Scott, we can do that offline and give you some more details.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Sure. Fair enough. And just one more on the pricing or what occurred rental revenue in the quarter. The timing of projects; were these things that you feel you're going to get back in the third quarter, they were just pushed back or did they result in cancellation?", "Michael Kneeland", "We have not seen any of our large projects of any magnitude be cancelled, what we did see was and particularly in the Canadian marketplace it was held up by the lack of engineering drawings. With regards to the Aerial East and our larger projects here was related to steel and weather getting the jobs up and running.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. So you do feel that it's just a pushback.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, that's why -- that's part of the reason why we brought the fleet in to man those jobs.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay, thanks. And following up on an earlier question on used equipment sales, I know first quarter's a big auction quarter. Could you and you've given good color on what you're seeing in auction and retail? Could you give us an idea of the mix of retail versus auction in the first quarter relative to the second quarter?", "Marty Welch", "I don't think we've got quarterly numbers, but in general about 75% of our used sales are at retail and others one by one. And then another significant piece is a trade back to the manufacturers, particularly in large Aerial, so our auction has historically been less than 10% of our total used sales.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. I'm sorry I'm going to go back to a pricing question just by Aerial versus earthmoving, any additional color you guys can give on that? Is it all earthmoving or\u2026", "Michael Kneeland", "With regards to auction prices?", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Just by pricing in general what you're seeing out there. I'm sorry, I'm jumping back, not in used equipment anymore, but now I'm talking just in the rental space.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well we have demand, our Aerial regions, their rental rates have been holding firm. We don't give specific categories of equipment other than the fact that the Aerial as we manage our rates with a lot of rigor and we have the reports and visibility, but so far, to date obviously the areas we saw the biggest declines, and would also affect some of the aerial equipment with the markets in particular.", "Marty Welch", "Yes, you know Scott, our biggest weapon here is the ability to reposition this fleet as a national company. So in the weak markets such as California and Florida, we have moved very large amounts for us [fully] out of those markets and re-purposed that as Michael said, to markets where we have better demand. That is a very big weapon in terms of responding to pricing pressure.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks. A couple quick more, I'm sorry for being a hog here. The industrial, has that crept up as a percent of revenues I think we were at 17% last quarter?", "Michael Kneeland", "On a year-over-year basis it's up, but it hasn\u2019t moved significantly. It's our focus. It takes a longer term, turnaround time. The ones you have to negotiate, you have to keep yourself in the game. We are being proactive in that arena. It's a large market, the market is we only have about 4% of the total industrial market, so we see that as a very unique opportunity for us to leverage our size.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Great, thanks. And one final on the margin front. Within contractor supplies do you have a target margin you're shooting for that you would share, looks like you're making progress there just any parameters you're thinking about there?", "Michael Kneeland", "I think longer term we are looking at getting upwards of the 30% margin, that's the area that we're focusing on. Obviously the 24% is stuff in the right direction, and we'll continue to focus on as we go forward.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Alright. Thanks very much guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you sir. Our next question or comment is from the line of Joel Tiss with Buckingham. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Joel.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "Hello, how's it going?", "Michael Kneeland", "Good.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "That's good. I wonder just sort of a little bit more on what some of the things Scott was asking about. Are you changing your CapEx plans more towards monthly to match your contracts, or you're going to keep it on a quarterly basis?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, right now our total outlook has not changed. We have $750 million in total capital. Let me give you some breakdown -- let me break that down for you in a little more detail. About $85 million is non-rental, which is associated with real estate. We have about $32 million of leases that we are buying out, so effectively we are paying down debt; and then we've got about $20 million of refurb, refurbishing equipment; that leaves about $580 million. And what I did say is, as we go back to the back half of the year, we will increase our used sales. So at the end of the year, we'll be below our fleet levels on a year-over-year basis.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "And then can you talk at all like just color-wise about the mix of your CapEx? Are you shifting a little bit away from Aerial work platforms or you are continuing to keep most of the downward pressure on the earthmoving side?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, we haven\u2019t said we were shifting away from Aerial. In fact, our aerial purchases, and I announced this in our last quarter, we were going to have increases and in fact we have increased our aerial fleet. And in particular one of the areas is the large [brooms] for the power plants, which has that demand. Most of our purchases really come from customer demands.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "Okay. And then just two other ones. Marty can you talk a little bit about, I saw there was a big increase in the accounts payable in the quarter or year-to-date, can you just talk about maybe what's behind that or how sustainable is that direction, and that's what I'm trying to get at.", "Marty Welch", "Yes. There's nothing unusual there. Must have just been the [cork] of when the check runs went out or something. We are moving, as everyone is, trying to move our AP more toward 60 day terms as a general standard, so we make progress on that as time goes on. But there is nothing unusual there.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "Okay. And then last, I wonder Mike if you can just talk about your comments about the gradual decline in non-res spending. What gives you confidence there? Can you give us some of the puts and takes? We obviously know California, Florida sink, what are some of the highlights on what's still growing and they're breaking ground on enough new things that gradual decline would continue, say, into 2010 as well?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, obviously some of the sectors you're relating to is the industrial sector, industrial will continue to be a focus in growth opportunity. All of the refineries are working at full capacity to produce gasoline, oils and other industry, the power plants getting their EPA compliance by 2010, the health area is another area that we're going to see continuous strength as we see in aging population. ", "And then infrastructure, there's a need for infrastructure and a compelling need for infrastructure; however, it will be tempered by the fact of the municipal governments' being able to fund it. But infrastructure will be at some point a growth opportunity. And it's a very large portion of non-building construction as well.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "But it's still kind of flattish to down right now, though, right?", "Michael Kneeland", "That's correct.", "Joel Tiss - Buckingham", "Yes. Okay. Alright, thank you so much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Philip Volpicelli with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Phil.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. How are you today?", "Michael Kneeland", "Great.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "With regard to the daily, weekly, eight-monthly, I guess there might be another category, can you give us the rest of the breakout? You said monthly was 68%. Can you give us the other pieces?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. Our daily business is 13, that's down a point. Our weekly is flat, it's at 19. And then you've got 68 that's the monthly which is up.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And you don't have like an other category for longer than that?", "Michael Kneeland", "No, we don't.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. An as it's logical to think that your daily is probably your most profitable and as you move further along it gets less profitable?", "Michael Kneeland", "No. That's not the case at all. Obviously when you have daily business, there's a lot more touches to it. You have to bring the equipment in, you have to service it, you have to check it over and it goes back out. The longer term in the monthly contracts is a profitable growth opportunity for us, we're focused on.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So rates might go down but because there's less touches it actually might be more profitable for you as a business?", "Michael Kneeland", "Absolutely.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Got you. And then with regard to your outlook, I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly, I think you mentioned that your guidance includes a 1.5% decrease in rates. And in the second quarter here we saw 1.4%, yet I think we all agree that the market is starting to soften. So how confident are you in that 1.5% rate decline in your guidance? Is it something that you're going to have to reassess as you go forward?", "Michael Kneeland", "No. we've built in what we believe the market will be. Obviously year-to-date we're down 0.6%, and in the back half of the year we'll be down by about two points.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Alright, that's interesting. And I think in the past we've talked a point of rating it was about $25 million EBITDA, does that still hold or is that changing with you guys doing all the cost savings?", "Michael Kneeland", "No. That's great. That's a good number. ", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. With regard to the closures, were they in Florida and California, and are there other closures that might occur before the end of the year?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. Some of the closures were there, and we don't talk about where potential closures would be, obviously because of our employee base. But we continually look at all of our branches on a monthly basis, and make the appropriate changes where necessary. That's why in fact we closed six more in the last quarter. And if we continue and see opportunities to repurpose our fleet in other areas and take down our underperformance, we'll do that.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And with regard to the restricted payments basket, I think Chris you and I had talked about a number of around 165 pro forma the two transactions for C and D and the stock, and I think Marty you said there would be 200 million pro forma taking out 125 million of the [fourteens], and I only see about $37 million of net income in the second. I know there's going to be some in the third. So can you guys walk me through how we get from where we were pro forma the transactions of $200 million at the end of the third quarter?", "Marty Welch", "Yes. A big factor of course is the we only paid $22 a share for the common and not $25. That's probably the biggest difference. I think rather than take up time on the call if you want to give Chris a call he can kind of walk you through the map on that. ", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "That sounds great. Thank you. And then finally, obviously the market's going to get tougher, there might be some acquisition opportunities out there. One; are you guys interested in looking at acquisitions; and two, what size would that be upto; and three, do you have a leverage target that you don't want to go above?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. We obviously were very opportunistic and we're going to take a look at the market. Obviously as we go through the climb, we're going to be making sure that if we can grow through profitable growth, we'll take a look at any one of the acquisitions and size is something that we don't necessarily pinpoint on. We take a look at does it accent our current model, while we grow on market share to profitable growth in that format. ", "Obviously when you take a look at where our stock is right now and where it's trailing at a multiple of EBITDA, we will not want to go above that as a guideline. And again opportunistic we'll look at it, we don't really comment and talk about them because that's the nature of the business, but we are very opportunistic. And I would also point out that this is an area that's a core competency for this company because of our background, it's not only doing acquisitions but integrating them very well.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much guys. Good luck.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Yvonne Varano with Jeffries. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Yvonne.", "Yvonne Varano - Jeffries", "Hi. Thanks. I think most of my questions have been answered. Just on a housekeeping, you ran through the share account Q3 and 4Q, could you do something similar for the interest expense and maybe what the run rate you're anticipating coming out of the year is going to be?", "Marty Welch", "Yes. What we can do, we can follow up with you offline in terms of modeling the interest expense.", "Yvonne Varano - Jeffries", "Okay. Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Varadarajan Sundar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Varadarajan Sundar - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, couple of housekeeping questions. On the debt side, as you repay this $125 million [cold], do you expect to use the revolver or do you expect to pay that down with free cash flow? And could you give us what the pro forma debt number is going to be following the $125 million call that you're doing on the 14% notes?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. The company is at its maximum use of working capital in the third quarter, so we will use the revolver for this specific transaction, however we do generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. So we have a longer-term outlook here that says that we are not just substituting one form of debt for another but in fact we're going to pay down.", "Varadarajan Sundar - Deutsche Bank", "And then, on that working capital front, somebody asked the question of on accounts payable, and you were up about $110 million or $112 million on the accounts payable front in the first half of the year. As you look at the back half and given that your CapEx number in the back half is going to be somewhat lower on a year-over-year basis as well as on a first half to second half basis, do you expect that accounts payable to go down a little bit more than what you've seen in the past? How do you see that number accounts payable playing out in the back half of the year?", "Michael Kneeland", "Right. I don't expect anything unusual in accounts payable. To be honest we haven\u2019t even focused on that. We do have an initiative to - as we do strategic sourcing and as we work with our vendors to generally move our vendors to 60 days. We have made some progress on that. There's really nothing unusual going on in accounts payable this quarter and I would not think it would act differently at the end of this year than it has at the end of other years.", "Varadarajan Sundar - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thank you. And finally, going back to this back half EBITDA number. At the mid-point of your guidance seems like your EBITDA will have to grow about 35% in the second half compared to the first half. Last year it was only up about 26% in the back half. Do you expect pricing to be down 2% in the back half of the year, compared to the first half, or are you seeing your proportion of monthly sales is higher? What gives you the better visibility to expect this second half to perform as well as it has on a seasonal basis and in fact better when conditions are actually getting a little softer?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. Well the biggest factor there of course is our continuing focus on cost reductions. We are down absolutely $21 million less spending SG&A in the first half, and we can expect that to continue. And though the pricing and utilization outlook that we talk about includes the shift, the monthlies, if you will, these are not added as factors, we're just trying to give you a little color about why this is occurring. ", "As the fleet shifts a little bit more towards aerial and away from earth, the aerial business tends to be more monthly. That's really what's driving that, but it doesn't necessarily mean we're deteriorating incrementally as long as you're getting pricing and utilization and shift monthly, we're just trying to give you a little bit more color.", "Varadarajan Sundar - Deutsche Bank", "Alright. And finally, the expense side seems to be the opportunity here, and you had SG&A of about $126 million this quarter, how should we think about that on an absolute dollar basis for the back half of the year?", "Michael Kneeland", "Specifically for SG&A?", "Varadarajan Sundar - Deutsche Bank", "Yes.", "Michael Kneeland", "We don't give line item by quarter kind of forecasting, but we are going to continue to make continued progress in these areas. We're working on very hard. It's one of our primary areas of focus.", "Varadarajan Sundar - Deutsche Bank", "Alright. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of [Chris Daugherty] with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Chris.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "Good morning Michael and Marty. Michael, you mentioned a dodge number down, starts down 14%. Was that both non-res and residential or just non-res?", "Michael Kneeland", "I believe it's the non-res number that they got forward in June.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "And then do they have an estimate for the '08 and '09?", "Michael Kneeland", "They have some estimates that are out there. I think when you take a look at the consensus, it's coming down. '08 it's going to come down 1.2 points on year-over-year basis and next year 6.7.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "And then can you just talk about the mix of your fleet and how you would expect that to sort of lag there? I mean, if we've seen starts increase up until now, are we talking six months, a year lag between when you might see your aerial being used or earthmoving, is there some sort of effect there?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, obviously when you start to see starts, the first thing that goes in is earthmoving equipment. And our earthmoving fleet has not, although it's down hasn't had dramatic shift. The area that we have fleeted up in 2008 is in the aerials sector. And aerial has still a lot of end markets that they can serve - not only construction but maintenance and also the industrial sector, which I mentioned is an opportunity for us.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "And then just lastly, a housekeeping number. Dollar utilization for the quarter?", "Michael Kneeland", "For the quarter it was", "Marty Welch", "It was 56.8% for the quarter.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "And what was the average fleet to the millions for the quarter?", "Marty Welch", "The OEC at the end of the quarter was 4325.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "Right. Thanks Chris. Take care.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question or comment comes from the line of Seth Weber with Banc of America. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Seth.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. On the used equipment, can you give us an idea, who's buying the stuff? Is this still largely international customers that are stepping in and buying a lot of the used equipment, and then I have a quick follow up question.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, obviously from the auction we're seeing more and more offshore international players coming in and buying our equipment, but the vast majority of our fleet is still being sold retail here and North America. Keep in mind that only about 35% of everything that's manufactured goes to the rental industry, there's still a very viable market out there for selling fleet.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Okay, thanks. And then conceptually, Mike, maybe you've been in this business awhile, can you compare how this downturn feels to the previous ones and how the operating environment compares and what you're seeing from a rationality among your competitors?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thank you, Seth, I'm not going to give out my age here, but I've been in the industry for 30 years, and you're right, I have seen different markets, I think that I take a look at 1991, the last downturn and then I put a lot comparison to that, to where we are today. ", "Having said that, the differences between our most recent downturn of 2000-2002 is really we're a different industry, and we're more professional. And I've talked about this one-on-ones and to the investment community, and I do believe that. I do believe that we're a different industry today. I know that this company is a different company today than they were back in 2000-2001. ", "We're focused on rates, we're focused on driving profitable growth, and we're doing the right things going into a downturn, we're selling off the fleet and producing cash flow, and at the same timeframe improving our EBITDA. So I think overall we're doing all the right things here, and I do think that the industry overall is being prudent and focusing this downturn just like they did the last.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Weber. Mr. Kneeland, I turn the conference back over to you, Sir.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well thanks, operator. Now before we sign off, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. And this is an opportunity for us to express how strongly we feel about the future in United Rentals and our company's ability to create value. ", "Now our results show that we're doing all the right things, and that we will continue to be vigilant as we move through the busiest period of our year in the third quarter. And with that, that concludes our remarks for today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We again thank you for your participation.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me is Marty Welch, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. In a minute, Marty will review our third quarter results. But first I think it's important to tell you what we're seeing out there in the marketplace and what we expect our operating environment to be as we move in through 2009.", "I also want to discuss some of the many operational and financial actions we are taking to navigate through these waters while positioning the company for continued growth in the future. I'm going to give you more detail than we typically provide on these calls, because we know the environment is of paramount concern, and we want to address it as directly as possible.", "I will also note that we want to provide as much visibility as we can today regarding our outlook for 2009. Further details and former guidance, we'll have to wait until we complete our planning process.", "As you all are aware, we are in the midst of an economy whose volatility has reached historic levels. Many of the contributing factors such as the credit crisis have a direct impact on our end markets. Unquestionably, as we expected at the start of the year, construction activity is slowing, but I wouldn't describe it as universal.", "Let me explain what we're seeing out there right now. Business clearly continues to clearly be challenging, particularly in Florida and California, where we have a big presence. These two states together account for more than 60% of the decline in our US. rental revenues for the quarter.", "By contrast, business remains steady in a number of markets, particularly the Rocky Mountains, Midwest and Texas, where we're supplying equipment to projects like to Dallas Cowboys Stadium in Texas and at Holcomb, Concrete Plant outside of St. Louis. And Canada continues to be strong.", "Looking at the landscape overall, we're most optimistic about the big projects, where funding is already in place and we have a presence onsite. In many cases, we've contracted for the lion's share of the rental needs on these job sites.", "The outlook for the smaller jobs is weaker, both residential and nonresidential. A number of these projects are subject to discretionary spending, and we're seeing some delays due to the economy. Some of you may be aware of the latest Architectural Billing Index that came out last week.", "It predicts the level of commercial building, 6 to 12 months into the future. The ABI was 47.6 for August, and is down sharply to 41.4 for September. Now, anything below 50 indicates a decrease in billing, so that the trend is down.", "Now, whether we see the same degree of weakness in our own markets remains to be seen, but we're well prepared for this, and I will discuss in detail. Specifically we are prepared for our primary end market, nonresidential construction spending to decline for the rest of 2008 and 2009.", "As we continue our budget process for 2009, we are planning on the basis of an overall GDP in construction environment that is substantially weaker than 2008. That's obviously not a great scenario, and I would prefer to have the events prove me wrong, but we have been and we are prepared for the challenge.", "United Rentals is a very strong company weathering a weak cycle, that requires difficult decisions, and we've repeatedly shown that we're willing to make those decisions and take decisive actions. It helps that we've been there before, and we know what to do. In fact, I personally steered rental companies through more of these cycles than I care to count.", "We expect to make steady progress each day, month and quarter until we lead the industry to a recovery. The many actions we've taken this year and continue to take are designed to position our company head the pack in recovery, both from a strategic and financial perspective. And by that, not just the up turn, but the long-term prospects for our industry, which are very good.", "Now I want to revisit the strategy that defines our business and where you can see the results of the actions we have taken at every front and while remaining optimistic for the future.", "I'll begin with our core operating strategy. First focusing on our core competency of equipment rental, second a greater control of our cost structure and third, a continuous improvement in fleet management. Then I will discuss the financial implications of these strategies and outlook. In particular, cash flow generation, EBITDA margin improvement. That's what we said we would do at the start of the year and we're doing it.", "First there is our focus on equipment rental. Our rental revenues are down year-to-date due to the cycle, but revenues are up due as a percent of total revenues, exactly as planned. In the third quarter, rental revenues were 78% of total revenues, up 5 percentage points from last year. Our core business, the focus of driving our EBITDA margin higher up 1.9 percentage points in the third quarter to 36.4%.", "We're also making excellent headway in our contractor supplies margin. In the third quarter, we grew our contractor supply gross margin by 5.3 percentage points, to more than 24%. By the end of the year, we will close all the two of our original nine distribution centers.", "As we execute our strategy, our customers will remain our top priority, as they have in good times and bad. We recently completed an intense program of customer research that will help guide our sales and service efforts in the coming year.", "In addition, over the next year, we expect to see an acceleration of the secular shift toward renting in a way from owning equipment, especially if credit continues to remain an issue. Our customers who were in the past purchased a piece of equipment may now be more likely to rent. This is particularly true in the current downturn, where customers are not only cash-strapped, but also find it difficult to finance capital purchases.", "Next is cost control. As I mentioned in January, we entered 2008 having made a number of moves in anticipation of the downturn. We made significant headcount reductions, renegotiated our sourcing agreements and conducted a head-to-toe evaluation of our branch network.", "I want to emphasize that we're every bit as stringent now as we were at the start of the year. In the first nine months of the year, we closed 31 branches. In the fourth quarter, we will close or consolidate at least 30 more branches and absorb both the cost savings and the impact on revenue.", "The cost of these closings is reflected in our revised 2008 guidance. 61 branches is a significant reduction. It represents nearly 10% of our entire network. Of our 20% branches that we're closing, will be sold off and about 80% will be repurposed, which will help keep our CapEx down in 2009. I want to emphasize that even with these branch closings, our footprint is still significantly larger than any of our competitors.", "We are continuing to address SG&A costs. SG&A expense decreased $17 million in the third quarter. We're also running the business more efficiently overall, with more success of leveraging our size. For example, we'll be able to cut administrative costs in many markets where branch density supports a more centralized support. And the actions that we have taken so far this year, translate into a headcount reduction of approximately 12% through the third quarter.", "Our entire organization is focused on proactively taking costs out of the business to align our expenses with revenue. We will continue to cut operating costs in ways to protect our customer service standards and without putting any of our long-term growth initiatives at risk.", "Fleet management is the third arm of our strategy. We get high marks on this one. In the third quarter, we moved a record amount of equipment among branches where we can expect to get higher returns. $1.5 billion of our fleet, based on OEC was physically transferred from weaker locations to those where we see demand, most typically within the same district. It's a very effective device that no other [equivalent] company can employ on the same scale.", "Fleet transfers are one of the key reasons where our condolization stayed constant at 68% in the third quarter. Rental rates is a more complex issue, and I want to keep the rates in perspective. On our last call, we told you that we expected to see rate decline of 1.5 percentage points for the full year. In the third quarter, our rates slipped 3.4%, but sequentially were down less than 1%. The current environmental points to our rates being down about 2.5% for the year overall.", "Our rate change isn't happening in a vacuum. Rates are one of the means we use to balance utilization, profitability and market share. Given the current environment, we will do our best to manage rates in a way that is consistent with our goals for long-term EBITDA growth and shareholders value.", "Given a chance to sustain utilization and track new business, we made a decision to delay some of our used equipment sales until latter in the year. We expect to see our year-end OEC at about $4 billion with an average age of 39 months to 40 months. Right now, we're down about 6% of our fleet on a unit basis count and more to come.", "In 2009, we'll significantly reduce our rental capital spending and continue to defleet. I can tell you that we expect our net rental CapEx, which we defined as purchases of rental equipment, less the proceeds of the sale of rental equipment to be about $100 million dollars in 2009. That's a dramatic drop from this year, when net rental CapEx will come in at about $350 million, and even more of a drop in 2007 when net rental CapEx was $551 million. Our 2009 plan will have an effect of aging our fleet while still cooping within our targeted range.", "From our customers' perspective, United Rentals will continue to address the number one need. We offer the best availability on the largest rental fleet in North America, and that won't change in 2009. When we talk about the fleet size and branch footprint and flexibility, we're talking about tangible, competitive advantages derived from size. These competitive strengths of size and scale are meaningful components of long-term value creation.", "For example, we're in a strong position to gain industrial market share because of our footprint. Industrial rentals are a multi-billion dollar market that is less cyclical than construction with far less rental penetration. Year-to-date through September, our industrial customers have accounted for 16.2% of our rental revenues this year, up from 14.3% last year. And this market continues to be a strategic focus for us.", "As one example, we recently acquired an industrial rental company in Corpus Christi to expand our presence in the sector. We also use our size to expand our national counts in government sales businesses. Our company's ability to serve large accounts is a major competitive advantage, and we haven't taken full advantage of that yet, but that's on the front burner now.", "In this context, we expect to continue to deliver strong cash flow to provide ample financial flexibility. Our experience in 2008, clearly demonstrates the cash flow generation potential of this business and the flexibility we have.", "Finally, we expect to pursue EBITDA in 2009 with the same single-minded focus that we're showing in 2008. Our branch compensation plans now use EBITDA as a target metric with a focus on profitable growth, and we will continue to do so.", "As I mentioned earlier, further details of our coming year will have to wait until we complete our planning and give you our 2009 guidance. That's a quick look under the hood of our strategy that's being applied at every level of our organization. We're making all the right moves, not only for the near term, but for the ongoing financial performance.", "We have stress-tested our financial model well beyond the expectations of this cycle, and we feel very confident with the results. The key point I want you to leave with is this, we are in choppy waters, but we are navigating the waters with a powerful strategy for profitable growth and rock solid liquidity. These strengths are serving us well in 2008, just as they will in 2009 and for the foreseeable future.", "With that, I'll ask Marty to go into more detail on our balance sheet and third quarter numbers, and then we'll go into Q&A, and we'll take your questions. Marty?", "Marty Welch", "Thank you, Michael. And let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on the call this morning. Michael has discussed some of our highlights for the quarter, and the actions we're taking to execute our strategy. I plan on reviewing our third quarter performance in greater detail, including the progress we're making on cost-saving initiatives, as well as our outlook for the year.", "Before I review the quarter, though, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our capital structure and liquidity position. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. This means that in a softer market, we will focused not only on the cost cutting and fleet management initiatives that Michael discussed, but also on generating significant free cash flow, which will allow us to delever when appropriate.", "Turning to our capital structure, as many of you are aware in the second and third quarters of this year, we repurchased all of our outstanding series C and D preferred stock, as well as 27.2 million shares of common stock, in a series of transactions that were accretive for the quarter, and will continue to be accretive next year.", "These stock repurchases, which will reduce our 2009 share count by about 39%, were funded with existing cash balances, borrowings under our accounts receivable facility, the issuance of HoldCo notes, and borrowings under our new and recently up sized 1.285 billion ABL facility.", "At September 30th, following the completion of the share repurchases, our debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times, an amount that is well within our comfort zone. Further we expect this amount, which is both below our historic average of 3.4 times, and significantly below our historic high of five times to be about 3.0 times by year end.", "The overall economic environment also provides important context for these actions. As we have discussed in the past, and as our results reflect, our business is counter cyclical from a cash perspective. Therefore, in a softer environment, the one we're experiencing now, we have the ability to generate even more free cash flow.", "Last year, we generated over $150 million of free cash flow, and this year we expect to generate about $375 million, including $240 million in the fourth quarter. And you can expect more free cash flow next year as we further reduce our CapEx, and defleet.", "In terms of liquidity, at the end of the third quarter, which marks the seasonally high point of our working capital usage, we had over $450 million of liquidity based on availability under our ABL and accounts receivable facilities, as well as cash on hand. Another measure of our financial health is our DSO. Our day sales outstanding, which improved from 53.6 days in the prior period to 52.9 days currently.", "Looking forward, if the market continues to remain soft, which we expect that it will, we will use this free cash flow to further delever. And when the cycle turns up, which it will do, we will redirect this cash to growing our fleet and further increasing share.", "Now normally I wouldn't do this, but given the current economic environment, I think it would be useful if we review the covenants underlying our new ABL facility. I'll focus on the ABL, because the covenants underlying our existing high yield indentures are in current space.", "There are two financial covenants associated with the ABL, a fixed charge coverage ratio and a senior secured leverage ratio. At the end of the third quarter, our fixed charge ratio was about 3.1 times, which is significantly more than the minimum threshold of 1.1 times. In terms of the senior debt ratio, it was about 0.9 times at the end of the quarter, which is significantly less than the maximum threshold of 1.75 times.", "So as you can see we had significant cushion in both of these covenants and looking ahead we're very comfortable, even under increasingly challenging economic conditions that we will be in compliance. In other words, we've stressed our models, and we were comfortable and confident that we have the flexibility and liquidity to manage through the downturn.", "It's also important to point out that these covenants will spring off next June on the one year anniversary of the ABL, provided our availability exceeds $257 million, or 20% of the facility, which is fully our expectation. That gives you an overview of our capital structure and liquidity and now let's turn to the third quarter performance.", "First our revenues. Our rental revenue decreased 6%, reflecting a 3.4% decline in rental rates, as well as particular softness as Michael mentioned in California and Florida. Although rates were down slightly more than we liked, our time utilization of 68% was flat year-over-year, driven by fleet transfers and a greater proportion of monthly rentals.", "In terms of contractor supplies, our revenues were down about 44%, but our gross margin improved 530 basis points versus the prior year. In line with our strategy of repositioning this business.", "Second, our SG&A of $133 million decreased $17 million dollars, reflecting our continued focus and disciplined approach to right sizing our cost structure. Third, our EPS for the quarter was $0.98 cents on a share count of 77 million shares, compared with $0.97 cents on a share count of 115 million shares in 2007. As I mentioned earlier, the share repurchases will reduce our 2009 share count by about 39%, so we expect continued accretion from the transactions next year.", "And finally EBITDA. Our EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points to 36.4%, also reflecting the success of our cost initiatives. While we were especially pleased that we generated this margin expansion when total revenue was down 12%, we are not complacent. There is much more work to be done, and savings to be realized.", "In terms of our cost saving initiatives, we believe we can generate about $200 million of savings over the next five years from the execution of these plans. During the quarter, where we saw our EBITDA margin improve 190 basis points, we realizes $39 million in cost savings.", "These savings come from a number of initiatives including our strategic sourcing initiative and headcount reductions. To put it in perspective, our workforce, at September 30, 2008 is lower by about 1,400 FTEs year-over-year. This is the equivalent of about 12% of our workforce.", "While we're pleased with our progress on these initiatives, we realize there is more opportunity. That's why we have taken action to close an additional 30 branches in the fourth quarter, bringing our full-year count to about 60 branches or around 10% of our total. Besides these anticipated closures, we've also recently completed the outsourcing of our accounts payable function, which will not only improve cost, but also controls.", "Now, let's take a moment to review our revised expectations for full year 2008. Our pro forma EPS guidance has been revised to a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share from a previous range of $3.15 to 3.25 per share. This outlook, which reflects the acceleration of softness in our end markets includes an estimated fourth quarter charge of about $0.13 per share, principally related to the closing of approximately 30 branches.", "Our revenue, EBITDA and free cash-flow guidance is as follows: We expect total revenue of between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion including rental revenue of about $2.5 billion. Our pro forma EBITDA guidance, which excludes the impact of the SEC settlement is $1.07 billion to $1.1 billion and represents a pro forma EBITDA margin of 32.6 %, which is up 110 basis points year-over-year. We're forecasting a full-year tax rate of about 37.7% before discrete items, and approximately $350 million to 400 million of free cash flow after total CapEx of about $715 million.", "That summarizes our outlook, and now I think we'll turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A. Chris, if you can start the Q&A session?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question or comment is from the line of Alex Blanton with Ingalls & Snyder. Your line is open.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "Just a question on your rental CapEx for this year and next year, which is down 33%, by the way, for the nine months, according to the cash flow statement. This is the gross, not the net. You gave the net figures earlier, but we haven't talked, and I don't think about the gross rental CapEx for this year or next year. What's forecast?", "Michael Kneeland", "I'm going to ask [Chris Brown] to answer that question. He's our Assistant Controller.", "Chris Brown", "Hi. How are you? In terms of 2009, I think Michael mentioned directionally it would be down, but we wait until the first quarter to give additional guidance. In terms of 2008, our full-year outlook for rental CapEx is $630 million, which contemplates no growth capital, and that will be down from the $770 million of gross rental CapEx last year.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. So that's only $40 million then in the quarter because you did 590 through the nine months?", "Chris Brown", "That's correct. We do substantially all of our CapEx purchases by the second quarter to get them ready for the traditionally busy third quarter.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "Well, now you forecast a decline in the net for next year, so you must have a forecast of the gross rental CapEx. You're just not sharing them with us? I mean, you said $100 million would be the net figure for 2009. So you don't want to share the gross figure with us?", "Chris Brown", "I think as Michael mentioned right now we're going through the planning process. I think the message we were trying to deliver is that from a net perspective, our net rental CapEx will be down significantly from a level in 2007 of $550 million to an '08 level of about $350 million.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "For next year, you said $100 million.", "Chris Brown", "The net figure, that's correct.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "So that's a decline of 250. Can we look for a similar 250 decline in the gross, or are the sales of rental equipment going to change?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike, Alex. Basically the message is we're going be defleeting next year, and we're going to be taking, one of the levers that we've always talked about is our capital spending, and we will be aging our fleet out, as we go into what we believe. And all industry resources are telling us that next year will be a much softer year. So are going to be defleeting. It's too early to tell. We do plan to give guidance in early 2009.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. Any idea how much you're going to age the fleet?", "Michael Kneeland", "It's too early until we go through. Our range has always been 35and 45 months, and we'll still been within that range.", "Alex Blanton - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. In that range and then finally AWPs, versus in the dirt equipment, would you comment on that for '09, both going down the same amount, or one less than the other?", "Michael Kneeland", "I think that one is market-driven. Our plan process is very much all the way down to the branch level. They build it up. It's too early to tell if you're asking for my professional opinion, we will probably continue to hold some of our dirt. We've defleeted a lot of dirt this year, and we'll probably defleet some of our aerial business as we go through '09.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue is from the line of [Henry Kirn] with UBS. Your line is open.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "If you look at prices in the used equipment today, you held off on some of the sales in the quarter. Looking at the fleet, what are you seeing in the market today? How are used equipment prices trend?", "Michael Kneeland", "Let me break that down into several buckets. First and foremost, our utilization was high. It was 68%. That's one of the reasons why we kept it. On the top of that, the used prices specifically, we reported 32% margins. The vast majority of our sales are retail, but if you're talking specifically about the auction, some of the auction prices, we have seen some softness, particularly in the area of the dirt equipment.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Okay. And as you look at the runway on SG&A going forward, how much more do you think you can take that down overtime to offset some of the negative cyclicality right now?", "Michael Kneeland", "Again, we're going through our planned process. We made a commitment to reduce our SG&A and our cost overall. That's something that we started out in 2008. Very happy to report that we continue the focus on that $17 million, as we still want to knock our range down, and we have a lot more to go.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Okay. One last one. Have you seen any changes in the pricing of new equipment from OEMs to you to get you to buy a little more than you otherwise would?", "Michael Kneeland", "No. We don't buy based on the pricing they give us. We have a history of being very aggressive of negotiating, partnering up with our vendors. We are going through that process. It's too early to tell. We do work with them over the course of the year to find ways in which we can both take cost out of the business.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "That makes sense. Thanks a lot.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Scott Schneeberge with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Schneeberge - Oppenheimer", "Could we focus a little bit on the pricing? Was it just a matter of the high exposure to California and Florida? Obviously you had a great quarter of moving fleet around, but could you just delve in a little bit deeper on what you think impacted you versus your expectation there?", "Marty Welch", "That's a great analogy. When you take away California and California, they are depressed. As I mentioned 60% of our revenue in the third quarter, the decline we saw in rental revenue was attributable to those two states.", "When you look at the rental revenue, the rental rates specifically, they accounted for about 25% of the decline, as we went through. We are defleeting in both of those areas. As a matter of fact, we have done a very good job. We're down almost $80 million on a year-over-year basis of defleeting and repurposing that capital, but there is still good customers there that we need to wrap our arms around and focus.", "Scott Schneeberge - Oppenheimer", "Great, thanks. Shifting gears a little bit, contract supply sales, a nice year-over-year margin move there. You mentioned on the call, you're down to two distribution centers left. Are you going to go to a pure outsourcing model? Are you going keep the two DC's into '09, just strategic thoughts there.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would say right now we are very comfortable where they stand today. We reserve the right to always focus on them and to the extent that they're not performing or we can find an alternative. We will look at that, but we will continue to focus on improving our margins. We've made progress, we're not done yet.", "Marty Welch", "Scott this is Marty. The two DCs that we have are outsourced. So we can change our mind on those on very short notice.", "Scott Schneeberge - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Great thanks for the (inaudible). Marty, just real quick. The leverage at the end of the year, I believe you said on this call 3.0. I realize I'm being nit-picky; because it's a good level, but I think the company line before was 2.9. Is there anything that we should read into that? Just a little bit of less that reduction. Just if you could elaborate there, even if that is if I am even accurate on that?", "Marty Welch", "You are accurate. It's just really rounding the EBITDAs down a little bit. And I don't think we've changed our mind at all about the cash generation that the company is going to have.", "Scott Schneeberge - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Seth Weber from Banc Of America Securities. Your line is open.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Just going back to the rental pricing discussion for a minute. One of your competitors, I think, this week announced a pretty robust increase in floor pricing, which contradicts the number you have put up. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace? Is it rational out there? Are you seeing anybody, off the reservation at this point?", "Michael Kneeland", "That's a great question; I am going to address it this way. One of which is, we proactively manage our rates and we will continue to do so. 25% of our rate decline occurred in two areas of the country we were having a strong presence are down significantly.", "With regards to our competitor's one, I don't know how they calculate rates. We're seeing good discipline out there, obviously there are regional areas where we do bump into things, but if you want to quantify it for national level, we're not seeing anything that is dramatic, and I think that the industry overall is being very responsive.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, thank you. A separate question . On just the math here, you kept your revenue guidance I think intact, and lowered your EBITDA forecast a little bit, which implicitly brings your EBITDA margin forecast down. Is there something we should be thinking about that's kind of just a temporary pressure on the EBITDA margin, or is there something that I'm missing here?", "Michael Kneeland", "", "I'll try to answer it, and if I don't answer it we can probably take it offline. But our focus has been on improving our EBITDA margins. Our EBITDA margin is actually up, but one of the biggest impacts that we're having currently going into the fourth quarter is obviously closing our locations. But we think that is the prudent thing to do for the long-term value of our shareholders. We will continue to focus on EBITDA and even to our improvement.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Maybe we can take it offline. And just like last clarification, was the $0.03 charge in the quarter, was that in your previous guidance for the, I think it was what 3.25.", "Michael Kneeland", "Chris is going to answer that question.", "Chris Brown", "Yes. I think what you're referring to is the charge. It was a non-cash charge that we took at the end of September.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Right.", "Chris Brown", "In anticipation of paying down an additional $125 million of the HoldCo. So when we gave our guidance at the end of the second quarter, the 3.15 to the 3.25, it did contemplate that charge.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "It did, okay.", "Chris Brown", "Yes.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Actually just lastly, is there a dollar utilization for the quarter?", "Michael Kneeland", "It was 60%.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Sixty?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Christina Woo with Soleil Securities. Ms. Woo your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Christina.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "I was hoping that you could provide some color on your acquisition during the quarter, the Corpus Christi industrials acquisition, may be providing us with some information on the number of locations you acquired. The age of the equipment, value of the equipment, [multiple] paid?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, we don't give that level of detail other than the fact it was a small acquisition of $11 million. Had three branch locations, located in Corpus Christi. One of the advantages that we have is being able to bring that into our organization. These are independents that have a good line of business in the industrial. 60% of their business was industrial related, and we wanted to leverage our size with our fleet to grow that business.", "So we think it was a smart move, and gets us in the door towards the industrial side of the business.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "That's great. I also noticed, in the quarter, that your new equipment sales continue to be quite robust, particularly in light of the weakening macro environment. Can you give us some information on what type of equipment you're selling, if it's more aerial or dirt and who is buying this equipment?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, it's a De minimis portion of our business, as far as the way we track it. But what I will tell you is that there is still a market out there where people want to own equipment. There is a market, and some of our customers, some of our largest rental customers will also buy equipment. But it's a little bit of everything, from aerial equipment to material handling devices, to some small dirt equipment. There is no one area that sticks out.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Okay, last question. I was hoping you could give us some rule of thumb that maybe you use with regard to pricing. We have talked about pricing quite a bit, but an increase in pricing by 1% would lead to what sort of EBITDA impact?", "Michael Kneeland", "It's $23 million, EBITDA impact.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Perfect. Thanks so much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of [Phillip Paselli] with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "I just wanted to get some more clarification on the OEC. Can you give us some more decimal points than 4.3 billion.", "Chris Brown", "Phil this is Chris. At the end of the second quarter it was 4340, at the end of the third quarter it was 4348.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And do you expect that to come down?. Obviously as you guys defleet do you have a target for the end of the year?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. I mentioned we're going to come back down about 4.1 billion.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, flat 4.100.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. Somewhere in that range. We have to go to the back half of the fourth quarter, and we'll give that number out. But that's our target.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Great. And when I look at the cost savings, I think Marty you mentioned $39 million in the quarter. If I look back at my notes, about $23 million was supposed to be strategic sourcing initiative. So the rest is headcount, but it sounds like you have cut more heads than originally thought.", "So can you give us the 200 million number, sounds like it might be a little low, considering you've done more action. Are we going to come above that. Is that something you're holding back for 2009 to give us some more guidance on how much cost savings you can come out?", "Marty Welch", "Right. One of the things that happens with strategic sourcing obviously is if the business is a little smaller, than we buy less things, and so we have less savings from SSI. The headcount is a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be as well. So it's a mix. We said before, we have a five-year goal of $500 million of incremental annual EBITDA. I still think that's a good goal.", "We said $200 million of that comes out of the cost cutting. We're sticking with that. And then the rest of it will come as we grow top-line and hold our cost in [bailout]. So, all of that is still part of our master plan. The individual mix of items does move around a little bit, but all of these initiatives are moving forward.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's great. Then you repurchased 125 million of the 14% notes in the third quarter. You're going to generate $240 million of cash in the fourth quarter. Will you give us any guidance as to how much of the 14% notes you plan the buyback in the fourth quarter? What the restricted payments basket is before and after any such transaction.", "Marty Welch", "", "Sure. We look at all of the options for the use of our cash opportunistically. In the last year, we bought back HoldCo notes, we bought back stock, we bought in the preferred, we've done an acquisition. So as we look at all of our alternatives and consult with our board, we'll continue to hopefully make smart choices.", "We've set a goal that will never let the restricted payments basket go much below $100 million dollars. And I think that's a good goal. So, whatever actions we take that impact the basket, we would try the keep it in. I think to bailout in restricted payments basket right now is around 200.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So you are not willing yet to tell us if you're going to or not going to buyback 14% in the fourth quarter.", "Marty Welch", "", "Most people talk about that after they do the actions, so I think we'll leave it at that.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. In terms of the acquisition outlook, clearly this was a nice acquisition for you. Are there many more in the [hopper] or was this a kind of one-off for you?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. We're going to be opportunistic; we are going to take a look at what's out there. I think that given the current business environment may provide us some opportunities, and we want to make sure that we review those and analyze them and see how they would fit in.", "This one we did in Corpus Christi fit everything that we were looking for and directionally goes after the business that we want to focus on. So, we will continue to look at the horizon with our eyes wide open. We don't have anything we're going to announce.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then just last question. In the past you've given us your 2008 outlook for time utilization and rates. I believe you mentioned that rates are going to be down; I think it's 1.2% if I'm not mistaken. And then what's your estimate for time utilization for the 2008?", "Michael Kneeland", "Go ahead, Chris. You want to answer that?", "Chris Brown", "Just to confirm in terms of the rate, I think what Michael had mentioned, we forecasted to be down about 4% in the fourth quarter, which will be 2.5% for the full year. I think in terms of time utilization, full year they will be down slightly year-over-year.", "Phillip Paselli - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thanks guys. Good luck.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of [Emily Shanks] with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.", "Jason Tuhio - Barclays Capital", "Hi good morning. This is actually [Jason Tuhio] in for Emily.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Jason", "Marty Welch", "", "Hey. You don't sound much like Emily.", "Jason Tuhio - Barclays Capital (representing Emily)", "My first question relates to your revised full-year guidance. Specifically which end markets are the biggest drivers for the guidance cut? Was it Florida and California?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. That's part of it. There was also a delay. We are seeing some delays in some of our smaller-end projects that we're looking at, but we go through a process of looking at all of our branches and our districts to put forward a quarterly review that we go through. It was a collection of things. It was also looking at the branch reductions and taking down our fleet. Although our fleet is relatively flat. It's important to note that our unit count is down by 6%. So, all those things go into our numbers, our calculation.", "Jason Tuhio - Barclays Capital", "All right, great. That's very helpful. And then secondly, what percent of the fleet at quarter end was earthmoving, and what percent was aerial, if you can provide that?", "Marty Welch", "", "Just aerial specifically is about 51%, and dirt is about 13, and then forklifts is 18%. Those are the big buckets.", "Jason Tuhio - Barclays Capital", "All right, Great. And then, just lastly, is the plan around the 14% Hold Co notes, still to pay those down within four years?", "Marty Welch", "", "Yes. We will work those off as we think it's economic to do that.", "Jason Tuhio - Barclays Capital", "All right. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Chris Daugherty with on Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "", " Just talking about the rates a little bit and your dollar utilization, I mean it looks like your dollar utilization was down roughly over 4%, but your time utilization was flat and your build rate was down only 3.4%. Can you just describe the way you calculate the change in rental rates? Is that a mix-adjusted number? Is it a build number? Is it just a new contract rate? How is that calculated?", "Marty Welch", "", "It's a weighted average between day, week and month, and everything is calculated accordingly, and that's how we put it forward.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "And then can you just talk about your philosophy on time utilization versus rental rates? I mean, is your priority to hold a target utilization rate, and then sort of how the rental rates move around or is it to hold rates.", "Marty Welch", "It's a combination of things depending upon the market that you're serving and the type of equipment. We try to maximize and get the highest rate we possibly can in any given market, and we have a robust system that we put in place and to go after that. The biggest areas that we saw weakness and that was challenging was in Florida and California. And then we have some other markets that were also like that, but then we had some offsetting. It's market-by-market and it's product-by-product. And we go through an evaluation.", "We look at the returns that we're getting collectively across the company; and to the extent you can get something at a higher rate or higher return in one market and they have demand for it, and we've got another market that may have high demand, but not getting the return. Then we're more prone to move that asset over to where we can get a better return. And now that we've changed our compensation system to more of an EBITDA driven, our branches are the result of our fleet movement is moving in that direction.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "Michael, I know you said that there are differences in rates geographically. Can you tell us what the rates were down in Florida and California, or just relatively how much more they were done?", "Michael Kneeland", "We don't have that, but we can do that offline and give you that data.", "Marty Welch", "Let me just add that, when rates are down severely, then we respond by significant defleeting. So, I mean, one of the real advantage of a national network is the ability to move fleet around.", "Chris Daugherty - Oppenheimer", "All right. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of [Joseph Baumeister with Blackstone]. Your line is open.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "Hi, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Joseph.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "The game plan for next year, is being driven by an outlook for the operating environment. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing and what you're most worried about?", "Michael Kneeland", "At the beginning of the year, I stated that we were anticipating a downturn in the back half. I don't think anyone could have forecast, the current course of events that's happened over the last 90 days and also the credit crisis.", "Having said that, the industry resources that are put out there kind of give you two goal posts. They go from 4% down to all the way down to 9% down. Global insight, which works closely with ARA, is projecting roughly around 5.5%-5.6% down on a year-over-year.", "So we look at that level, that's at a macro level, and then we go through our planning process and we build everything up from the branches. As Marty mentioned, there are different markets. There are markets where we have, even in California, that are very strong. But, you know, we have a strong presence there.", "So everything's from a grassroots. We build it up, and that's how we'll analyze the market going into next year. What worries me the most is, the question on everyone's mind is what happens to the credit. The credit crisis, how long and how deep will it be?", "Marty Welch", "I think we definitely have a bias to our conservatism when it comes to the fleet for '09.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "What cost reductions are currently in place, and what do you expect to accomplish for the rest of this year and next year?", "Marty Welch", "I think the branch closing program is one of our bigger cost initiatives, because it takes overhead out, allows us the ability to move fleet around more aggressively. We've talked about headcount. We've talked about strategic sourcing. We really are looking there as we talked about on previous calls literally over a hundred line items that we track. We have a meeting every couple of weeks. There's a name next to every initiative, and we're trying to execute on all of them as we go forward.", "Michael Kneeland", "To expand on that a little bit, there is a laundry list that we go through. We started out with a 122 items. Some fall off as we successfully complete those and some we add back on. The list is still in a 100 range, and we still focus on that. And the point is that there's nothing that we're not looking at. We're looking at everything inside the organization from the executives all the way down to the field.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "But SG&A is still high as a percentage of sales relative to some industry benchmarks?", "Michael Kneeland", "That's correct. And we are focused on that. We are continuing to take costs out of the business and as I stated we're not done yet. We're going to continue to focus on that as we go forward.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "Do you have a goal?", "Marty Welch", "Joe on previous calls, I've said that I think something in the 13 range, SG&A as percent of revenue is achievable here. I think that's going to require some recovery on the top line, but certainly I think we can look to that over a multi-year period.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "RSC is currently below 10. Is there a reason why you don't think you can't get there?", "Marty Welch", "I think we're they're moving in our direction. As they experience being a public company and what that means and other costs, I think we're both working hard on our costs and they are certainly a well run company.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "Do you expect to be able to offset the impact of the economic decline on your business with cost cuts more or less?", "Michael Kneeland", "Not entirely. I think it's unrealistic to think that you can take cuts in the top line that are severe, particularly on rates. The flow through on rates to the bottom line is virtually 100%. The only thing we don't pay on a rate decline is the commission. I think we're going continue to work hard on this; but it's not entirely within our control to offset big declines.", "Michael Kneeland", "I also want to point out that we don't have a high concentration of our business in industrial and we do know that's profitable. So we will focus on that, until we go through the planning process, it's too early to determine what '09 will actually look like.", "Joseph Baumeister - Blackstone", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question or comment from the line of [Cynthia Marinos] with Lloyds TSB Bank. Your line is open", "Cynthia Marinos - Lloyds TSB Bank", "Hi, good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Cynthia Marinos - Lloyds TSB Bank", "I actually have two questions. My first question is, can we expect liquidity to tighten in the form of increased utilization under the revolver given this softness?", "Marty Welch", "No. It's actually the opposite. As long as we're continuing to be in a defleeting mode, liquidity will continue to increase significantly. The stress point in this industry comes at the point in time when the economy turns, and we want to [pour] back a lot of the fleet into the field.", "Cynthia Marinos - Lloyds TSB Bank", "I see. Okay. My second question is, the 60 branches that you're going to look to have closed by the end of the year, what will be the impact on EBITDA?", "Marty Welch", "30 branches were closed in the first quarter, Cynthia, and the other 30 we plan to close in the fourth quarter here. We've said it's a charge of about 0.13 per share. A lot of that is reserved for future rent payments. Chris, do you have anything to add to that?", "Chris Brown", "That's correct. As Marty mentioned, 30 branch closers hit in the first half of the year. So that's already been absorbed into the first half EBITDA. The additional charge associated with the fourth quarter closings is about $0.13 on a pro forma share count.", "Cynthia Marinos - Lloyds TSB Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question or comment is from the line of Yvonne Varano with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Yvonne Varano - Jefferies", "Thanks. I just want to clarify what you said earlier in regard to the gross capital spending. The 630 that you gave for '08, is that purely rental, or does that include other property equipment as well?", "Marty Welch", "If you'll recall it is total rental. Our CapEx guidance that we reaffirmed was $715 million that includes $630 million of rental CapEx, all of which is maintenance, and then $85 million of non-rental CapEx.", "Yvonne Varano - Jefferies", "Okay. And then, when you gave the net, that includes the other outside of rental as well.", "Marty Welch", "No. That was a pure net rental CapEx.", "Yvonne Varano - Jefferies", "That's net rental CapEx because if you do the math, then you're implying a pretty significant jump in sales of used equipment in 4Q?", "Marty Welch", "That's correct. I mean, we'll have to see what the pricing we actually realize in the fourth quarter, but that does imply $280 million used equipment sales for the full year?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is, Mike. It's important to note that it's not unlike any other year; it's typically in the fourth quarter when we have most of our used sales. With 68% time utilization, which is all-time high for us in comparison to last year, the best use of our fleet is on rent. That's where we get the highest profitability and typically as we go through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter is when we do most of our sales.", "Yvonne Varano - Jefferies", "Okay. It's just $90 million 4Q number, and it just sounded a bit high. I see that includes some of the sales of the equipment out at the branches as well?", "Michael Kneeland", "As I said, we're closing locations, and a portion of those assets will be sold off.", "Yvonne Varano - Jefferies", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Operator, I think this is a good time to wrap up the Q&A. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We've covered a lot of important ground. I'm glad we had the opportunity to see while our confidence in United Rentals is [rooted] in a company that is rock solid, both financially and operationally. I can point to a lot of reasons for that. The determination of our people, particularly in the field, our proven ability to generate free cash flow, the groundwork that we've laid in advance of the cycle, willingness to pull all of the levers at our disposal, and the all important loyalty of our customers. When our end markets recover, we expect that more equipment will be rented more than ever before, and United Rentals will continue to be on the leading edge of that opportunity.", "This concludes our remarks for today, and operator you can now end the call.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded and is copyrighted by United Rentals Inc.", "Before we begin, the company has asked me to remind you that many of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions, will contain forward-looking statements. United Rentals' businesses and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected by any such forward-looking statements.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the company's fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings release. For a fuller description of these and other possible uncertainties, please refer to the company's Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which has just been filed with the SEC.

During the conference call, references will be made to free cash flow, pro forma EPS, EBITDA, and pro forma EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer, and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team.", "As you know, Bill joined us in December following an executive position with Dow Jones, Alcoa and GE and I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome him in front of the investment community. Bill is a very strong addition to our executive team and we are extremely pleased to have him on board.", "He will review our results with you later in the call. I also want to welcome Jonathan Gottsegen, who's with us here today as our new general counsel. Jonathan is the most recent addition to our leadership team, following the appointment of three new directors to our boards in January. There are Jose Alvarez, Bobby Griffin and Filippo Passerini and like Jonathan, they are highly seasoned executives who's expertise will be instrumental in helping us to obtain our strategic goals.", "I want to use my time today to address three topics, the current construction environment, and our perspective on 2009, and our long-term goals for the business. But, before I begin, I want to be clear about something, some aspects of our 2008 performance were disappointing to the company, and to me personally.", "We did what we could do to forecast results in a very challenging economy, but nevertheless we end up missing the mark. As it turned out, there was almost no visibility as we progressed through the fourth quarter, and there appears to be even less in 2009.", "Consequently, we have chosen not to provide a formal outlook. We will rather focus on giving you meaningful information about our strategy and markets, and our financial position.", "We have an excellent plan in place, one that keeps our priorities firmly on cash generation, liquidity, cost control, and customer service. We are executing that plan in every area of our business that is within our control. As a result, there are a number of accomplishments that we can point to for 2008.", "We generated $3.3 billion of revenue and over a billion dollars of EBITDA despite a construction market that became substantially weaker in the second half of the year. Our rental revenue increased to 76% of total revenue reflecting our strategic re-focus on our core business of equipment rental.", "Our gross margin on contractor supplies improved 460 basis points to 23.6% for the year, as we continued to retool our merchandise range. And we held time utilization nearly constant year-over-year at 63.6. However we lost some ground on rates in the process. And I want to talk more about that in a minute.", "We closed or consolidated 43 branches in the fourth quarter, that's 13 more than we had originally estimated. In total, we reduced our branch count by 75 locations in 2008, without exiting any state or province. And we reduced our head count by approximately 1,000 employees. But bear in mind, we'd already reduced our workforce by about 1,100 in 2007, so the total over two years comes to more than 21 employees. Bill will discuss some additional improvements, including free cash flow when he reviews our results.", "All of this was accomplished within an operating environment that that deteriorated as the year progressed. Commercial and industrial construction took an unprecedented double hit from the economy and the credit crisis.", "This contributed to a rapid decline in non-residential construction starts in the fourth quarter. For customers who can't get jobs or finance, it has a domino effect on equipment demand for months to come. When the banks stop lending, jobs started to dry up.", "Now that we're in 2009, and with two months under our belt, I can tell you that that scenario that we saw in the fourth quarter is still playing out. The weakness that we saw in Southwest, Southeast and Northwest regions last year, has now extended to all of our operating regions in varying degrees.", "California and Florida remain our weakest markets. 20% of the branches we closed or consolidated in 2008 were in those two states alone. There are still some bright spots out there. These tend to be based on a size of the project or the type of construction rather than on geography.", "Construction of warehouses, hotels, and retail stores, slowed down considerably in January, while some energy projects and manufacturing plants are moving ahead. As two examples, we have the lion share of assets on rent at a wind turbine plant in Colorado and a power plant in Nebraska.", "Unfortunately, for every project that has a green light, I could probably name several that have been postponed or canceled. The immediate climate for commercial building is still very weak, but there will be a recovery, but at this time, it's still off everyone's radar.", "In 2009, we're prepared for a year over decline in non-residential construction spending somewhere in the upper teens and possibly more to follow in 2010. You've heard me say many times that we went into this downturn with our eyes wide open to the challenges ahead. And, as you will hear from us today, we are continuing to confront the situation head-on, aggressively, realistically and with discipline.", "We're being realistic about the fact that there's very little clarity in our operating environment this time. Internally, however, we have extreme clarity into the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we have a very disciplined plan in place, that allows us to navigate to a softening market in 2009 and 2010, one that keeps our priorities firmly on cash generation, liquidity, cost control, and customer service.", "I want to touch on some of these key leaders of that plan. First, I can confirm our earlier estimate that net rental CapEx will be roughly $100 million in 2009. Now, we expect this result, with an average age of our fleet about 43 months, which is still within optimum range.", "Our intention is to continue to de-fleet by reducing underperforming categories in older units. We took an aggressive stance with de-fleeting in the last three months of 2008, selling off $209 million of OEC, at lower than historical margins, although these sales are still profitable for us. Our primary goal for used equipment sales in this or any environment is to properly manage the size and age of our fleet and our free cash flow.", "I also want to put some detail on SG&A, rates, and fleet management. As reported last night, we achieved a significant decrease of $84 million in SG&A expense in 2008. In 2009 we want to drive down our SG&A number by another $40 million to $50 million.", "Our commitment to cost control is not a temporary reaction to the economy. It is a cornerstone of the strategy that we put in place nearly two years ago. Our strategy defines United Rentals first and foremost an equipment rental company. It mandates that we are continuously improving our cost structure and our fleet management.", "We've made great strides in rationalizing our cost structure, but there's still a lot more that we can do. This year, we're looking at a number of ways to control the cost, including business process improvements, new efficiencies in our IT infrastructure and sales force productivity tools.", "We are continuing to negotiate new supplier agreements through our strategic sourcing initiative. This saved us another $22 million in 2008. And while the incremental benefit of strategic souring will lessen over time, we expect to realize at least $15 million in additional savings this year", "Rates are a more complicated issue. Our rates ended down 3.1% year-over-year, which included a 6.4% drop in the fourth quarter. Some of that decline comes from competitive pressure in the marketplace. Our sales -- our salespeople are focused on our most profitable customers, rather than chasing every rock-bottom deal that's out there, but there's still a large area of business that falls in the middle ground and no one in our industry is immune from rate pressure.", "In addition, some of the decline is attributable to our emphasis on national account agreements. National accounts typically transact at lower rates but higher volumes and are more efficient to service. As a result, they tend to be more profitable over time. In 2008, the majority of our new national account agreements were added in the second half of the year, which impacted rates without the benefit of volume.", "One of our goals in managing rates is to grow our market share with larger accounts and industrial companies. We also want to serve our local customer base as profitably as possible, even though our branches are seeing a lot of pressure on pricing.", "Now given the severity in duration of the recession we expect rates to continue to be challenging this year. As I've noted before, rates and time utilization are a complex balancing act, one that is directly related to the positioning of our fleet. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we transferred a record $1.4 billion of fleet among our branches.", "That's more than 30% of our total investment in fleet redeployed to areas where we saw potential for greater demand. As we continue to de-fleet in 2009, we see transfers playing an important roll in asset management.", "Fleet transfers, are just one example of how the size of our branch footprint gives us a lot of room to leverage of our leadership position. We also have the advantage of size for pursuing national accounts and industrial rentals. These two sectors will help make our business less sensitive to commercial construction cycles in the future.", "Our renewed emphasis on national accounts, while still less than a year old has all the hallmarks of a home run. In 2008, we put more than 15 new agreements in place, with customers that are strong, well-respected companies in their own right and our branches understand the importance of earning their loyalty.", "This group also includes government sales program where we increased our rental revenues by more than 11% in the fourth quarter. The industrial revenue is another promising target. The industrial market generates an estimated $12 billion of rental activity annually, and we serve about 4% of that right now and we can handle a lot more.", "Industrial rental is a highly profitable business for us and over time we will make a strategic shift and a number of branches tailored to serve industrial customers and add more of these companies to our national account program. Externally, the new economic stimulus package should benefit our US operations, although not until the second half of the year at the earliest.", "There is similar legislation on a drawing board in Canada. The stimulus package includes a total of $135 billion of new infrastructure spending, which is good news to most of our end markets. A lot of it is earmarked for projects that will require underground construction, such as $7.2 billion to expand broadband networks and $4 billion for sewer work.", "As a leading trench safety rental company in North America, we could expect to benefit at the leading edge of these expenditures. Every lever I just described to you, the branch network, headcount, CapEx, cost control, fleet management and customer mix has the ability to be a stabilizing force in these turbulent times, as well as a trigger for future growth.", "We are definitely focused on navigating the recession with every lever at our disposal. But we're also focused on our longer-term objectives of EBITDA growth, market share, and customer service leadership.", "I'm happy to say, that there's huge energy around customer service this year at United Rentals. We recently launched operation United, a massive company wide program designed to earn and retain customer loyalty. Independent research shows that no equipment rental company in North America has succeeded in differentiating itself on the basis of customer service. And we are committed to capturing that advantage.", "Our branches have adopted a no excuses attitude toward each transaction. They understand that this opportunity is entirely within their control. Customers are going to experience a higher level of service and greater consistency of service whether you rent from us from Miami or Vancouver.", "Now as part of operation United, we are changing our sales compensation system, our account service structure, and benchmarking to reflect our goals. We have a plan in place to leverage our scale, win new accounts, increase our share of wallet with existing accounts, and entrench our brand as the first choice for equipment rental.", "This is an exciting mission and it received an incredible reaction from our branch managers in January. They are really fired up and to see that kind of enthusiasm for customer service made me very proud to be part of this company.", "Now before I hand over the microphone to Bill, I want to make you aware of a new investor presentation that can be downloaded from our website. It covers many of the topics you'll hear today from us, and provides further detail about our strategy and business model.", "Now, in closing, I want to return to the statement I made earlier in this call. We are continuing to confront an extremely challenging situation head on; aggressively, realistically and with discipline. There are no rose colored glasses here. We know what we're up against and we're advancing to it with a strong, well formulated plan of action.", "We have ample liquidity, as Bill will review with you in a moment. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in a challenging year just as we did in 2008. And we're continuing to bring down our costs, and we have a clearly defined strategy for long-term growth.", "Furthermore, our company is guided by a leadership team that brings a powerful mix of rental industry experience and business expertise to every strategic decision we make. We will continue to build on this dynamic, bringing the best people on board to make sure that United Rentals continues to capitalize on every opportunity.", "And with that, I\u2019ll ask Bill to review our balance sheet and our 2008 results and then we'll go to Q&A and take your questions. Bill?", "William Plummer", "", "Thank you Michael, and good morning to everyone. Michael has provided an overview of our 2008 performance, the current construction market, and our long-term goals for the business.", "I plan on reviewing our 2008 performance in greater detail including the progress that we're making on cost savings initiatives. I'll also give some more detail to our objectives for 2009. But first, I'd like to take a few minutes to focus on our liquidity and capital structure.", "Before I joined the company last December, I spent a good deal of time analyzing the company's strength and its capacity to weather this economic downturn. I looked at the company's free cash flow, liquidity, debt structure and financial covenants. After this review, I asked myself one simple question: Can this company survive a prolonged economic downturn? Obviously, my answer was yes, and here's why.", "First, the company generates significant free cash flow. Over the past two years for example, we've generated about $575 million of free cash flow, including $335 million in 2008. And looking ahead to 2009 we expect to expect to generate another roughly $300 million of free cash flow.", "That means that over a three-year period, we would expect to generate just under $1 billion of free cash flow. This is not surprising, because this business is counter cyclical from a cash perspective.", "Second, the company is in a strong liquidity position. At the end of December, we had over $600 million of liquidity, including availability under our ABL, and our accounts receivable facilities.", "The third factor I considered was the company's financial flexibility. Regarding our covenants, the most restrictive covenants we face are in our ABL. There we have two financial covenants, a fixed charge coverage ratio and a senior secured leverage ratio. At the end of the year, our fixed charge coverage covered ratio was at 2.62 times and that's significantly more than the minimum threshold ratio of 1.1 times.", "Meanwhile the senior leverage ratio was at 0.95 times at the end of the year and that's significantly less than the maximum threshold ratio of 1.75 times. So as you can see, we had significant cushion in both these covenants at the year-end.", "Looking ahead, we expect these covenants to become even less restrictive since the terms of the facility allowed them to spring off in June of this year if we maintain availability in the facility of at least 20%. And that's a level we expect to easily exceed.", "Debt maturities also figure in our financial flexibility. The company has no significant debt maturities until 2012, when our 6.5% senior notes mature. And even though investors have a put right where they could put up to $144 million of our 1.875 convertible debentures back to us in 2010.", "Our capital structure provides us with a great deal of flexibility. Because of this flexibility and because of our strong free cash flow generation, we're able to retire $125 million of the 14% HoldCo notes in the third quarter. And we're also able to repurchase a $130 million principal amount of our high yield notes in the fourth quarter.", "Looking at all these metrics and recognizing our ability to reduce CapEx, de-fleet and optimize our branch network and headcount, I'm very confident that we will weather these turbulent times. Having said that and recognizing the current construction environment and the seasonal nature of our business, we are expecting a net loss in the first quarter.", "Now let's turn to your 2008 performance. First our revenues; our rental revenue decreased 6% in 2008. And that reflects a 3.1% decline in rental rates. Although rates were down significantly, our time utilization is 53.6% was basically flat year-over-year, reflecting our focus on fleet transfers, targeted used equipment sales and a greater proportion of monthly rentals.", "In our contractor supplies business, although our revenues were down 44%, our gross margin improved 460 basis points versus the prior year. And that was in line with our strategy of repositioning the business.", "Second, SG&A. In 2008, our SG&A decreased by $84 million as Michael mentioned. And our SG&A as a percent of revenue improved by 40 basis points. This improvement which directly relates to headcount actions as Michael mentioned as well as the success of our SSI strategic sourcing initiative includes $65 million of savings from salaries, benefits and P&E.", "Third EPS; our pro forma EPS for the year was $2.62 on a share count of 85 million shares. That's compared to $2.67 on a share count of 114 million shares in 2007.", "And finally EBITDA, our pro forma EBITDA margin increased by 120 basis points to 32.4% also reflecting the success of our cost initiatives. While we were especially pleased that we generated that we generated this margin expansion in the face of revenue being down 12%, we are not complacent. There is much more work to be done and savings to be realized.", "Now let's take a moment to review our objectives for 2009. As Michael mentioned, given our lack of visibility into the operating environment, we will not be providing a formal outlook. Having said that, what I can talk about are certain aspects of our business that are firmly within our control.", "For example with respect to SG&A, although SG&A as a percent of revenue will be under pressure this year, we do expect to reduce the absolute level of SG&A spends by $40 million to $50 million.", "Looking at our CapEx as Michael mentioned we're forecasting net rental CapEx for 2009 of about $100 million. This represents a significant reduction versus the $360 million for 2008. And it illustrates the capacity of this business to generate significant free cash in challenging markets. And although reducing CapEx will cause our fleet to age in 2009, we believe it is the right decision for the business as it will lead to stronger free cash generation.", "As I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate about $300 million in free cash flow for the year and if the environment continues to be remain challenged, which we expect it will at least for the balance of 2009, this cash will likely be used to further reduce our debt levels.", "In terms of whether we look at repurchasing additional high yield debt as we did in the fourth quarter, or retiring more of the 14% HoldCo notes as we did in the third quarter or simply paying down the ABL, these are the decisions that we'll make throughout the course of the year in consultation with our Board of Directors.", "That summarizes my comments on 2009 objectives. Now, I would like to turn it over to the operator to begin the question and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Manish Somaiya from Citi.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "", "Yes, hi, good morning. A couple questions. Michael, can you give us a sense for the used equipment market? I think we've heard from a few sources that used equipment market was off about 5 to 8% in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense for where we have been over the last 12 months, and where do you it see that going?", "Michael Kneeland", "Okay. Manish, how are you? Thanks for the question. The used prices, I mean, there's two dynamics, one of which is, what goes to auction and what goes to retail. What we do on a retail basis, where we have over 70% of our sales is retail, we're still seeing relatively healthy margins.", "However, in the auction, we have seen prices come down about 10% year- over-year, part of that is mix, Manish. I was just recently at the large auction in Orlando with Ritchie Bros. Both myself and other members of our management team, went through there and I will tell you that some of the prices that I saw there were actually up slightly from what they -- were the results that we saw in December.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi", "And Michael, just as a follow-up to that question then, can you give us a sense for where earth\u2019s moving is vis-\u00e0-vis Aerials, what's the difference in used equipment prices?", "Michael Kneeland", "Used equipment prices at that auction were specifically -- were actually down. They were down, again, probably in the vicinity of 15% to 20% on a year-over-year basis, but again it comes down to model the year and brand, and the amount that was in this auction.", "By the way, this auction was the largest auction in the world, and it was up significantly on a year-over-year basis. With inside of Aerial, again its product mix, booms better than scissors, small scissors which are more related towards retail and that type of construction. We saw prices come down on year-over-year basis.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Okay. So I guess that at a call, I think in the last cycle we were off about 15% to 20% and we're just entering the downturn and we're off 15% to 20%. So, would you say that we are likely to reach the trends we saw in the last cycle for used equipment.", "Michael Kneeland", "I think it's too early to tell Manish, the world today is far different than it was in the last downturn. I will tell you that at this auction, I was impressed with the amount of foreign bidders coming in due to the new channels that they have out there.", "So I think it's yet to be determined. My sense is that, typically what you see happens out of this auction, in Orlando, kind of sets the base for the year, but, again, the year has to play out.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Okay. And then just one last thing, on the similar topic, of the things that we'd seen in the last cycle was that some of the old retirees came back to the industry with the availability of secondary equipment.", "Are you seeing that this cycle and obviously in the last cycle when the retirees came back, it had a pretty negative implication for pricing, so can you just give us a sense of what's going on, on that front?", "Michael Kneeland", "", "Well. I will tell you that I did see some old faces that I haven't seen for a long time at the auction. That being said, not all of them were buying. Some of them were just \u2013 they are \u2013 its part of their DNA they want to see what's happening in the industry. But today's industry is far different, again, than it was in the past, so to get any kind of scale, customers demand, newer equipment.", "I shouldn't say newer equipment but equipment that is useful, for the life, and, again, the changes that happened between people trying to enter into market today is far different, and the services that we provide, not only ourselves but other national companies are very hard to duplicate just by having someone entering into the marketplace.", "Manish Somaiya - Citigroup", "Okay. Well thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Henry Kirn from UBS.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Henry.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "A quick question on utilization and pricing, is it possible to give a little more granularity either by equipment type or by geography?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I can tell you more by equipment type. And by the way, Henry and for everyone on the call, there's a lot of detail in our presentation that we put out there, based on our type of equipment, and it's broken down into several categories, but you'll see that the Aerial and also the rough terrain or forklifts, material handling devices, our time for the full year was in the 70's. The one area that you saw time decrease was in earth moving, in particular larger earth moving devices.", "Those are areas that as people aren't developing large tracks of tracks of lands any more and our trench and our other, was actually flat on a year- over-year basis, but it's a different type of business, its more system oriented, high return business.", "Geography wise, it's a mixed bag out there. Obviously, as I mentioned, what we saw, a continuation in Florida and California, we saw, decreases there. As a result of that, we moved the fleet around outside of those regions.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "", "Well that's helpful, and in terms of your cost cutting initiatives. How much further do you think you have in terms of being able to cut back before you could impact the operations?", "William Plummer", "Henry, its Bill Plummer, I don't have a specific number that I can give you on that, what I would say is that, I think everyone here feels, I certainly feel that, there is plenty more runway ahead of us on cost reductions. Across SG&A, across our branch activities, we can identify a number of initiatives yet to be played out, and, we'll describe them as we go forward.", "Henry Kirn - UBS", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber from Bank of America.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Hi, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just first a quick clarification on the SG&A expense reduction. Is that based off with just the absolute '08 versus absolute '09 or is that using the fourth quarter as a run rate?", "William Plummer", "It's absolute year versus year.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Okay. And, thank you. Can you talk about whether you're seeing any liquidity issues from any of your customers, or is anybody having, making requests to extend payments or fulfilling contractual obligations or anything like that?", "William Plummer", "Seth, we don't, we don't have any specific liquidity issues from particular clients. Our overall portfolio, as you might imagine has seen some extension of our receivables, days, over the last several months It's not dramatic, but it's in line with what you might expect given the challenges of the operating environment.", "We ended the year at a DSO of something like, just under 52 days, 51.6 days, and that actually was fairly flat versus the prior year. So, we had been focused on managing our exposure in receivables. We think we've got a lot of the right things going on. We've been able to manage the metrics pretty well, but we're starting to feel a little bit of pressure in the early part of '09 and we're going to keep very close tabs on it.", "Michael Kneeland", "Seth, this is Mike. I just want to mention one other thing. That is a lot of our jobs we can lien, we have lien rights. So we feel very comfortable with, what we have out there and as Bill mentioned we keep a keen eye on our receivables, particularly in this environment.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "", "Okay. Fair enough. Just going, going back to the pricing question and kind of the discipline in the market. Would you characterize that competitive pressures is coming more from kind of the mom and pop\u2019s, the local guys or is it pretty much across the board at this point?", "Michael Kneeland", "I would say that, that would be a fair assessment, obviously for smaller companies they are somewhat land locked, and they have no really any room to relocate their assets in any other given market. So we're seeing more of a competitive pressure in that arena, in that mid to lower size, and I think the rest of the industry is being responsive.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Okay. And then just one last question, is there a, a number we should think about for interest expense for 2009?", "William Plummer", "It will be up from 2008 reflecting the higher debt balance that we'll carry through the full year. I'd rather not provide a specific number.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Emily Shanks from Barclays Capital.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Emily.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "Hi, how are you all?", "William Plummer", "Good.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "I want to ask of the question on interest expense. Can you give us a sense of what we should expect for cash taxes for '09, please?", "William Plummer", "Again, we're trying not to get into a lot of detail on the exact numbers, so why don't I hold off on responding to that. It will be comparable to 2008. I'll leave it at that.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "That works. Thank you. And then as we think about what the minimum cash balance is that you guys need to run the business, what is that? Is it around $50 million?", "William Plummer", "We, we have historically preserved something like $60 million as cash, so that's probably a fair balance to use.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And, then do you anticipate having to pay a dividend to the HoldCo to pay the coupons during fiscal year '09 for the HoldCo note or do you already have sufficient cash up there?", "William Plummer", "We have sufficient cash up there.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then could you please let us know also what the remaining capacity is, underneath your baskets for future bond for purchases both by the senior tranche as well as the sub-tranche.", "William Plummer", "", "Sure. In fact may be I'll expand a little bit on this topic. The RP basket currently is significantly negative. You can imagine after taking a $1.1 billion impairment charge that that would drive a negative, and it has. We do have cash up in the HoldCo sufficient to not only service its debt, but also to retire issues at the HoldCo level if we chose.", "And we, as you might expect, also have various inter company arrangements between HoldCo and OpCo that continue to flow some levels of cash up to the HoldCo without having to flow through the RP basket calculation.", "So we feel that we're well positioned to be able to manage to service all of the debt at the HoldCo level as well as the debt at the OpCo level, and preserve some flexibility to how we might manage those debt balances as we go through the year.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and if I could, that's very helpful. One just quick follow-up question that in case I missed it. What is the amount of cash for the HoldCo?", "William Plummer", "I don't know. Do we put anything in the, take a look through the K and the guarantor statements, I don't know if it will explicitly describe it as cash, because we have inter company arrangements that HoldCo uses to then downstream its cash into the OpCo level. So take a look through the guarantor statements in the 10-K.", "Emily Shanks - Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Doherty from Oppenheimer.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Chris.", "Chris Doherty - Oppenheimer", "Hi Mike and Bill. Bill, just a quick question on the borrowing base, when was the last appraisal and when is the next appraisal?", "William Plummer", "It was in September. And its semi annually so the next time it will come in is toward the end of March.", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer", "And just expanding on the previous statement if we can get a little bit more clarity. When you talked, you mentioned that there's the quote on the 1.875 converts. Would you have enough cash, I mean, seemingly you don't -- well would you have enough cash right now at the HoldCo to take care of that, given that the RP basket is significantly negative?", "William Plummer", "Well the answer is yes. We have enough cash to take care of that. I'd add that our view is that the put, execution of the put is a scheduled payment and therefore is excluded from the RP basket calculation. So, even if we didn't have the cash, we feel comfortable that we'd be able to address that put if it happened.", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Next question operator?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Paselli from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your, question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Phillip.", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Good morning, gentlemen, how are you?", "Michael Kneeland", "Doing well.", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Good. So, adding onto Chris's question you could use the revolver to pay should put of the converts come true in March?", "William Plummer", "I'm sorry you were breaking up, can you repeat that?", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Yes, I'm sorry. You could use the revolver to fund the put of the converts, the 1.875 convert of the HoldCo, if you wanted to because they're a scheduled payment?", "William Plummer", "Yes, we believe that we could use the, the OpCo facilities to service that put.", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Great. And, then when you look at what you plan to repurchase this year, what's the decision matrix that you're using, is it the ability to buy debt at a discount, are you able to buy the 14% notes at a discount, because they don't trade as often. How do you guys think about what you might want to retire this year?", "William Plummer", "Sure. I'm an old treasury guy, so my mind is pretty easy to read. It's about what's the cheapest debt that we can retire in the capital structure. So we look at current pricing for the 6.5, the 7, the 7.75 and compare those yields to each others and to the 14% coupon that we're paying on the HoldCo notes.", "Our mechanism for retiring the HoldCo notes is a par call, and so that's the yield there. We compare the yields of the other instruments and we make a call as to which one we find most attractive, and then from there, we overlay a decision about what kind of liquidity we can find in the given issue at the time that we are looking.", "So that's sort of the mechanism that we go through. Obviously, all of that flows from a decision to, to repurchase, and that decision will depend on how things unfold through the year.", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay. Great, that's very helpful. And then on the original cost of the fleet. I think in the presentation you mentioned that $4.1 billion, are you guys willing to give us a little bit more granularity on that, maybe a couple more [decimal] ones?", "William Plummer", "On the absolute level of OEC?", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Yes.", "William Plummer", "It\u2019s $4.118 billion.", "Philip Paselli - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Perfect. Great thank you very much and good luck.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christina Woo from Soleil Securities.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi Christina.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Hi. Michael, you made a comment during the prepared remarks that there was a study, which concluded that no equipment rental company had successfully differentiated itself in terms of customer service.", "I'm wondering if you could provide us with some background on the study like who conducted it. How many were surveyed, when it was conducted and also what specific the customers are seeking that you plan to provide?", "Mike Kneeland", "Well, I'm not going to give the information on who we use because it's proprietary to that company. It is a national company that is very large in this space. They did an independent survey that we asked them to do, as part of this process. For we consider operation united and there is a lot of things that the customers who came back and part of that is -- the way in which we're structuring ourselves.", "We look at one point of contact, and we also developed a compensation program to drive some of the levers, consistency of services, and we'll layoff those matrix. I don't want to give a lot of detail because that's competitive information, but I would suffice to say that the information that came back was compelling.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Okay. Could you just let me know when that study was commissioned?", "Mike Kneeland", "That study was commissioned. It started in April of last year. It was ongoing through the balance of 2008.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Okay. And turning to the slide presentation that you posted online, slide 12 gives us a fleet snapshot which is really helpful. I was hoping you might give us a sense of how much you feel of aging the equipment by the type, by the four categories that you've outlined?", "Mike Kneeland", "Well. Obviously, the larger booms, you can always age out much farther. The aerial can go out, far and beyond, 15 months if need be or 60 months. Keep in mind that we do, do a refurbishing program and we don't change the age of the asset. So you can get a full year additional useful life. You can do similar rebuilding to our larger forklifts.", "Earthmoving is, is a different beast, so to say, because quite honestly, it beats itself up. I mean, when you look about dealing with dirt, it has a very has a very hazardous environment. So we would want to keep that within the range of where we have it today, maybe up a few months.", "Overall when you blend everything together, we're very comfortable between 35 months and 45 months. As I said, in my opening comment we'll come in about 43 months. We're very comfortable with that.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "And, approximately what percentage of your fleets is refurbished?", "Mike Kneeland", "It's a small amount. If you recall going back to two years ago, we started doing a refurbishing program in 2007, waited for the results, we expanded it in 2008. And a good portion of our capital that we'll be spending this year will go toward refurbishing.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Okay. So it's low single digits percentage?", "Mike Kneeland", "Yes.", "Christina Woo - Soleil Securities", "Of the fleet? Okay, perfect, thanks so much.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question from you Yilma Abebe from JPMorgan.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi, Yilma.", "Yilma Abebe - JPMorgan.", "Hi thank you. Good morning. If you look out in the volume trends in the last couple months in 2008, I guess -- with the evolving trend in a first couple of months this year. What are you seeing, what's the volume doing, a flat, up, down?", "Mike Kneeland", "Well, I think, you know, if you take a look at our fourth quarter, our volume came down in the back half of the year, and more significantly in the fourth quarter. we haven\u2019t given any kind of volume guidance as to what volume will do in 2009 other than the fact we\u2019re in a challenging environment. And that our primary end market of non-res, we expect to be in their higher teens as far as down in a year-over-year basis.", "Yilma Abebe - JPMorgan.", "Can you say as you started 2009 generally is the environment getting worse than kind of how 2008 ended or no material differences?", "Mike Kneeland", "I would say that the trend that we saw in, in the fourth quarter of 2008 is continuing in 2009.", "Yilma Abebe - JPMorgan.", "Thank you. That's it for me.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question from Seth Weber from Bank of America.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi Seth.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Hey, sorry just real quick question going back to interest expense. Was your response based on the $15 million number for the fourth quarter, or should we add back to 45 and use 60 and to get the year-over-year, when you're talking about '09 being up from '08 -- is that?", "William Plummer", "Seth, it's Bill, add back the gain that we flowed through interest expense. So I think when you added back, the interest expense in '08 was 228, after the add back, it will be a little higher than that in '09.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.", "William Plummer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Hi, it is actually Elegy for Scott. You mentioned that you expect to occur loss in 1Q '09. I just wonder, at this point what do you anticipate for the season now to pick up as we move through 2009, just any colors on there?", "William Plummer", "I wouldn't want to offer a lot more. The seasonal connectors are certainly driving our comments about 1Q of '09, and the seasonal factors should help as we get later in the year, whether or not and adding any more specifics to what that looks like, I'd hold off.", "What we tried to do was to give you sitting here nearly two months into the year for '09 a sense of what we're seeing for the first quarter, but we still face the same challenge that we faced in thinking about an outlook for the full year, visibility is just very difficult for us to have right now. And so we're very reluctant to add much more texture to what we said.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Thank you. And just another question now, you plan to use your free cash flow to pay down that debt, just how aggressive do you plan to work on that and do you plan to pay down like in terms of the absolutely amount would that be higher than 2008 or would that be at the same level of 2008? Thanks.", "William Plummer", "Again, we'll make that decision as we go through the year, but I think it's fair to say that managing our capital structure through this difficult period is a key objective, and that means making sure that we've got the debt balances commensurate with the amount of cash flow that we're able to generate.", "That also means position ourselves for the future. It means making sure that we've got facilities available to us when the turn comes that we could use to make more investments in the capital structure.", "So we'll make those decisions and balance them as we go through the year. I think its fair to say though that we're very focused on making sure that we manage the capital structure aggressively.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from James Ragan from Crowell.", "James Ragan - Crowell, Weedon & Co", "Yes good morning. Just a quick question regarding the, the debt coverage ratios, given the outlook for a loss in Q1, could you say what the range might be as of March 31st for your fixed charged and senior leverage ratios?", "William Plummer", "I'll hold off on adding any more detail. We can talk to you about it in April. How's that?", "James Ragan - Crowell, Weedon & Co", "Okay. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Okay. Operator, I think this is a good time to wrap up the Q&A. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Our goal has been to give you some meaningful insights into operation for 2009 as a way of combating the unprecedented lack of visibility in our marketplace.", "And as you heard here today our plan is our compass. No matter how murky things get, we have the ability to stay firmly on track as we move towards our strategic goals. We remain excited and energized, by the long-term prospects for our company, and for the equipment rental market in general. Our industry has a lot of growth ahead of it, and we want to be in the forefront of that opportunity and will be.", "This concludes our remarks for today, and operator you can now end the call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, you may now disconnect.

(NYSE:URI) Q2 2009 Earnings Call July 30, 2009 11:00 AM ET", "", "Executives", "Michael Kneeland \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "William Plummer \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Operator", "Welcome to the United Rentals Second Quarter 2009 investor call.  (Operator Instructions).  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, Operator.  Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  With me is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior management team.  Bill will discuss our current capital structure and review our financial results with you.  But first, I want to spend some time on our environment in operations, including the initiatives that led us to increase our targets for free cash flow and SG&A savings for the year.", "As we reported last night, we now believe our free cash flow will be about $325 million, instead of the $300 million we had originally projected.  We also expect to reduce our SG&A expense by $80 million to $90 million, which is about $40 million more than our original estimate.  ", "Now both of these metrics reflect our ability to manage our business with discipline and purpose in a challenging environment.  ", "Now as you will hear from us today, our second quarter story is one of sequential progress on key operational metrics in a market that is still declining, and that includes rates.  But I also want to make it clear right up front that we're not satisfied with our current rate performance, even given the severity of this downturn.  There are things that we can do to move our rates in the right direction and we're doing them, and I'll talk more about rates in a minute.", "This construction cycle is more severe than any in recent history, but it will run its course.  We have made a conscious decision to manage the company through the recession by balancing short-term and long-term goals.  ", "At the corporate level, we are pursuing a strategy of long-term profitability that is based on customer service leadership and shifting our customer mix towards larger, more profitable accounts.  At the branch level, our field operations are focused on managing daily performance and protecting key relationships.  ", "Equipment rental is a service business and to some degree, the amount of weight we carry in facilities, fleet, and payroll is a function of the need of our services.  Our branch count shrank by 6% in the quarter, which we believe is an appropriate amount of right sizing given the current conditions.", "At the same time, we're investing in making our existing operations as competitive as possible.  We are bringing discipline to every area of operations.  And we believe that it is possible to continuously improve many of our metrics in the event \u2013 even in this environment.", "The timing of the recovery still has no consensus within our industry.  Some of our customers are telling us that they are still working through backlogs of prior commitments, although the pipeline is dwindling.", "Commercial starts have taken the biggest hit.  Institutional projects are doing better, particularly in medical, education, and energy sectors.  Commercial construction will get no direct benefit from stimulus funds.  And most analysts are predicting a decline in this sector in 2010.  But the degree of decline is a matter for debate.  ", "We've seen projections ranging from nearly flat year-over-year to bearish forecasts with declines in the double digits.  Global Insight which tracks market activity for the American Rental Association expects commercial construction to decline 22% in 2010, hitting bottom in the third quarter.", "There's still a lot of volatility surrounding all areas of construction.  Just as one example, the Architecture Billings Index for June dropped nearly five points to a rating of 37.7, which is disappointing after seeing signs of stability in the ABI for April and May.  ", "Now despite some mixed signals, most construction analysts seem to think that the pace of decline will ease, but it hasn't hit bottom yet.  And we agree.  We believe that our end markets may stabilize and begin a gradual recovery in the third or fourth quarter of 2010.  Now part of this timing has to do with the nature of non-residential construction, which typically trails in economic recovery by six months or more.", "There are two exceptions worth mentioning.  One is Canada.  Global Insight predicts that Canada will show modest gains, both this year and next, in the commercial and manufacturing sectors.  As a broad statement, I can tell you that our own experience seems to support this.  In general, we are finding the rate of decline to be less severe in our Canadian markets, than in the U.S.", "Another bright spot should be the stimulus spending.  We haven't seen much impact from this yet, but Washington's beginning to apply pressure on states to spend the money more quickly on infrastructure.  Our GSA certification and trench safety expertise make a strong case to use United Rentals for these jobs.  In fact, we just got the green light for trench safety work on five miles of pipeline in Utah that's being built with stimulus funds.", "So that's a snapshot of our external environment.  We're not prepared to say the worst is behind us.  But for the first time, the worst seem to be in sight.  And so does the other side.  Now I'd like to turn the discussion inward to our operations.  A few minutes ago, I mentioned that our strategy is helping to drive sequential improvements in key metrics.  The other factor at play is that equipment demand always trends upward late in the second quarter, although this time the trend is very modest.", "We went into the quarter with our eyes wide open, knowing that any seasonal uptick would be muted by the recession and there would be no magic bullet.  Instead, we stayed focused on our strategy of transforming this business to drive sustainable improvement in key metrics over time.  As a result, we were able to mitigate the impact of the environment in the second quarter.  ", "Now I want to spend a few minutes reviewing some of those metrics in the areas of rate management, fleet management, cost control, and our proactive approach to right sizing the business, as well as our focus on national accounts through Operation United.", "First, rate management, as I said in the past, rates are a complex issue.  And there's no common platform for comparison in our industry.  That's why one of the metrics that we look at is dolly utilization.  The price a company can get for a rental transaction is affected by the overall economy, by fleet mix, customer mix, the duration of the rental and most of all by strategy.", "We manage our business for a balance of rates and utilization, taking all these factors into account.  Right now our focus is growing our relationships with key customers, while ensuring that we make profit from those transactions.", "When we break the quarter down in terms of rate activity, there are some positive signs.  We actually saw an improvement in sequential monthly rates in the quarter, when June rates increased 0.3% from May.  And July will show an even larger sequential improvement.", "Rates are still very much lower than we'd like, but we're moving them in the right direction through intense rate management and a willingness to walk away from unprofitable deals.  The challenge will come later this year and early next year when demand is likely to fall off.  By then, we will have several months of data from our pilot program for price optimization.  ", "We are currently using additional software to set rates in 92 pilot locations.  This is letting us take a more scientific approach to rate management in the field with a goal of capturing business at an optimum price.  Now we can make more informed decisions at market level and unprofitable deals will be more obvious to our branches.  ", "Now turning to fleet, the three fleet metrics I want to focus on this morning are used equipment sales, OEC on rent, and time utilization.  We have consistently said that de-fleeting is one of the leaders that we can pull if necessary.  And we're making good on that promise.  In the second quarter we sold 47% more fleet than in the prior three months, based on original equipment cost.  ", "Another metric that showed sequential improvement in the second quarter was OEC on rent.  On average, we had about $150 million more of OEC on rent in the second quarter, than we did in the first, despite significant de-fleeting.  And we're going to have another sequential increase in July.  Now some of this can be attributed to seasonality but it's also an indication that we're doing an effective job of fleet management.", "Time utilization is the third key metric related to fleet.  Although time utilization is down year to date, we achieved sequential increases in a second quarter at a pace very similar to last year.  Time utilization   in April was 59.4, in May 61.2, and in June 63.3. ", "Now turn to cost control.  In the second quarter we booked on our SG&A expense by $27 million on a year over year basis.  That followed a reduction of $21 million in the first quarter.  We closed 38 branches in the quarter which brings our total to 48 closures through June.", "We also opened two cold starts in the quarter.  Since January of 2008 we have reduced our network by a net 115 branches from 697 to 582.  This reduction is a dramatic shift from our company's historic pattern.  It shows that we are committed to taking decisive action as difficult as these decisions may be.", "As our markets continue to shrink in the early part of the year we made proactive adjustments to our second quarter plan, and as a result we are able to further consolidate our operations with almost no disruption to customer service.", "However, reductions of any kind are never easy.  There's always a human impact.  In the second quarter we lowered our headcount by another 800 employees, with the majority of them at the branch level.  And before I leave the subject of cost control I want to emphasize the actions we're taking are proactive rather than reactive.", "There is a strategic rationale for every decision we make.  For example, in the process of closing branches, we're also optimizing our footprint with an eye toward an eventual recovery.  And while we've increased our target for SG&A savings for the year, it's not the end of the story.  We will continue to look at ways to take excess costs out of this business now and in the upturn.", "And before I turn the call over to Bill I want to spend a minute on Operation United International Accounts Program.  For nearly a year we have been acting our decision to shift our customer mix towards larger construction and industrial accounts.  ", "From July of 2008 through June of 2009 we signed 157 accounts, 111 of them came on board since January so our National Accounts Program is making significant progress.  As expected many of these larger accounts are proving to be more resilient than our smaller more local customer base which is why we intensified focus on national accounts and should help with future cycles.", "We estimate that the new national accounts signed in the past six months represent a total of potential wallet of about $70 million in annual rental revenues even in this economy.  We are confident that once these customers do business with us our ability to meet their needs will earn us a significant share of that buy.", "Now under the umbrella of National Accounts we are having success in leveraging our size to attract large industrial customers.  Twenty-eight of the national accounts signed this year are industrial companies, and we have more on the horizon.  Through mid year, industrial rentals contributed about 19% of rental revenues which is about 10 points shy of where we see as an optimum mix. ", "We're definitely on the right track with our industrial business.  Of our top 15 industrial accounts 37 have been on board for at least a year giving us a basis for comparison.  For the second quarter more than half of these recent accounts increased their revenues with us even through as the economy declined.", "Now as I've mentioned in the past, industrial rentals have a prominent place in our long term strategy for growth both organically and through acquisition.  Last week we acquired Leasco Equipment Services an industrial rental company in Ohio, and while we remain open to additional strategic tuck-ins, our current operations are capable of handling much more than our current 4% share of the $12 billion industrial rental market.", "All of our customers, large or small, construction or industrial are dealing with the same economic challenges we are.  Customers are looking for a partner, not just a rental supplier.  Rather than sit back on our heels we're using Operation United to push forward with our customer service improvements that will cement our relationships now and bear fruit in the recovery.", "Every United Rentals branch is now using an Operation United scorecard.  It tracks performance against bench marks for metrics such as on time delivery and service response time.  Having visited dozens of branches I can tell you that our employees are embracing the scorecard and are starting to use it daily in their operations.", "They see customer service leadership as an attainable goal, one that will set us apart from the competition.  We plan to share more of these metrics with you on our third quarter call.  So as you can see, we're acting on a realistic and achievable blueprint that raises the bar on rental operations, customer service, and national accounts.", "All of these things are within our control and largely unrelated to the economy.  We've given you an unusual amount of operational detail this morning because we want you to understand the depth of our commitment to continuous improvement.  We are hitting our marks on cost control, cash flow and fleet management. ", "And our revenue mix is responding to our focus on larger accounts, even though our total revenues and EBITDA remain lower than we would like.  We remain committed to improving our margins and taking disciplined actions to do so.", "The depth of the construction cycle is testing our entire industry, and while we've had to take some unprecedented actions we also refuse to be distracted from our goals.  With a strong strategy in place, and plenty of levers at our disposal, we are prepared to manage the remainder of this downturn regardless of its duration.", "When the cycle turns you will see us capitalize on the same strengths that we're cultivating this year, weight management, operational efficiency, fleet management, financial agility, and the pursuit of customer service leadership.  These are the qualities of a company focused on industry leadership, long term growth as well.", "With that I'll ask Bill to review our second quarter results and the recent positive changes to our capital structure and then we'll go to Q&A and take your questions.  Over to you, Bill. ", "William Plummer", "I do want to touch on the second quarter financial results, but before I get there I'd like to go back and update everyone on where we are against the outlook that we've been updating throughout the course of the year.  I'd also like to spend a little time on our capital structure and liquidity position.  Maybe I can add a little bit more detail on the fleet management activities over the quarter and then we will end up with the financial results.", "So on the outlook, we gave three targets, SG&A reduction, net rental CapEx, and free cash flow at the beginning of the year and we've been updating them as we've gone along.  Mike noted that we've actually raised the target on SG&A up to $80 to $90 million reduction from our previous target of $50 to $60 million reduction, and that was up from the initial target we gave at the beginning of the year of $40 to $50 million reduction.", "We raised this target because we put a lot of effort into identifying ways to save on SG&A, and we're starting to see benefits of all that effort.  We're seeing it in just about every line of SG&A, salaries, benefits, T&E, professional fees, advertising, anything that is part of that total SG&A we are looking at and we've got initiatives around to try and drive further reductions as we go forward.  And as I said we've got more visibility, and we've got more confidence and that led us to raise the target to that $80 to $90 million level.", "On net rental CapEx, we're sticking with the target that we laid out originally for net zero for net rental CapEx over the course of the year.  We are about zero in the quarter, $84 million of proceeds from used sales against $86 million of purchases for rental equipment.", "If you look at the first half, we are actually at a net inflow of about $13 million over the first half, and as we've looked at our activities in the fleet, looked at our customer needs, and looked at our used sales opportunities throughout the course of the first half, we become more and more convinced that we've got the ability to manage our capital spend in a disciplined way, to manage our used sales in a disciplined way, and therefore you should be able to hit that net zero target for the year consistent with all the other targets we've laid out for ourselves, so we're sticking with net zero for rental CapEx.", "On free cash flow, we initially had a $300 million target for free cash flow.  We've raised that to $325 million.  That reflects some greater performance that we're expecting on cost, as you've seen in our target adjustments there, but we've got a little bit better sense of where rates are and where they're headed in the near term at least.", "And we've got some other cash flow levers that we haven't' pulled yet that we still have the ability to resort to. So we think that we've got enough visibility and confidence to be able to raise that target to $325 million.  ", "We made a good down payment on it in the first half, close to $200 million of free cash flow generated in the first half, so we're well on our way, and again we've got confidence on the 325 target.  So those are the comments I wanted to make on the three previous outlook targets.  I do note that, as Mike noted, we have added a target on cost of rent.  I'll touch on that a little bit more later in my comments.", "As to our capital structure, a couple of major events with regard to the capital structure it happened in the quarter, the big one that you all know about I'm sure is that we issued $500 million of new senior unsecured debt.  ", "We issued a 10-7/8 note maturing in 2016.  We issued that note as part of our strategy for managing the maturity profile of our debt portfolio.  The notion is that we'll use the proceeds to manage our ABL balance but also other senior debt maturities, in particular the six and a halves, which mature in 2012.", "As we go forward, we'll employ those proceeds in open market transactions and if necessary in other ways to address the overall maturity profile that we're managing.  In the first, excuse me, in the second quarter, we put about $200 million of those proceeds to work.  We bought back just over $200 million of face of the six and a halves using the proceeds of that debt issue.  The remainder pays down the balance of the ABL.", "Going forward, we'll look at opportunities as they're presented in the marketplace and make decisions about where to deploy those proceeds.  In addition to using the proceeds from the new debt issue, we've also used other cash to buy back other debt positions in our capital structure.  ", "And if you want more detail on that, we've provided a table in the Q that we filed last night breaking out the debt tranches that we bought and giving some more detail about the purchases there, so I refer you to that table.", "But in total we purchased about $125 million of face of other debt issues other than the six and a halves.  And that was part of our focus on paying down debt with free cash flow.  In the quarter, we reduced our face amount of debt by about $57 million.  And as you look at the first half, we're now down $170 million in face amount of debt over that first half.", "And if you include the cash buildup, the net debt position is now down $218 million in the first half, so making good progress on paying down our total debt balance and we'll continue to do so as we go forward.", "The other significant item that we had on our capital structure in the quarter was the springing off of our financial covenants under the ABL.  Recall that we had a test under the ABL that allowed the financial covenants to spring off if we maintained 20% or more availability in that ABL.  The test date was June 9 and we passed that test with flying colors if you will.  And so those covenants went away.", "And they'll stay gone unless and until availability under the ABL drops to below 10%.  Needless to say, we don't foresee that happening in any reasonable economic scenario.  And so we feel very comfortable that we won't have to worry about the financial covenants of the ABL for any time soon.  It's not an immediate impact for us because obviously we had lots of cushion relative to the covenant levels in the ABL but it gives us a little bit more flexibility to have those covenants gone.  ", "On liquidity, we ended the quarter with $915 million of total liquidity, that being the sum of cash on hand plus availability under our ABL, plus availability under our accounts receivable securitization facility.  ", "Our view is that $915 million of liquidity in this point in the cycle is a very, very strong position to have.  We feel very comfortable that that's an appropriate level of liquidity for us today and we'll continue to manage that as we go through the remainder of this year and into the next year.", "Let me just offer a few words on fleet management.  Mike gave some good insight into some of the activities around fleet, maybe I can add just a little bit more.  We transferred a record amount of fleet in the quarter, $1.6 billion in fleet.  Ended the quarter at a different, excuse me, ended the month during the quarter at a different home than it began the month, that's how we account for transfers in our overall fleet metrics.", "That has been a tremendous lever for us to be able to satisfy customer demand without putting more capital into the business.  So we're looking more and more at ways to leverage the total fleet and do so in a way that many of our competitors can't given the breadth of our equipment portfolio, given the geographic footprint that we have and the range of customers that we serve, we see fleet transfers as a real competitive lever for us, so we're going to continue to manage that.", "We already touched on used equipment sales and the role it plays in our fleet management.  Just to add a little bit more flavor there, we sold $271 million worth of OEC in used equipment this quarter, that's a record.  And we did it very consciously as part of managing our overall used equipment sales strategy but also as part of our fleet management strategy.  ", "Within that $271 million of OEC sold, the average month of the equipment sold was 78 months and so that played a very key role in helping us manage the age of the fleet overall throughout the quarter.  We ended the quarter with a fleet age of just over 40 months, down just a touch from where it was in the first quarter and very consistent with the target that we have for the full year.  We're still targeting just north of 43 months of fleet age at the end of 2009.", "Looking at our overall fleet levels, fleet OEC came down by $170 million during the quarter.  Unit count came down by about 16,000 during the quarter.  And then if you look year over year, OEC was down just about half a billion dollars, 13%.  And year-over-year, the unit count was down about 40,000 units or 16%, so positioning the fleet, managing it well within the context of the market that we're dealing.  ", "Let me add a few comments on our financials for the quarter.  First on revenues, our rent revenue in the quarter was down 28%, that reflects a 14% year-over-year decline in rate and a 2.4 percentage point decline in time utilization, obviously a challenging environment.  We continue to manage it effectively and will continue to do so.", "We feel like we're doing a reasonable job in the context of the environment.  If you look at our dollar utilization as Mike touched on, it's holding up although it's challenged versus prior years.  We ended the quarter \u2013 dollar utilization for the quarter of 44.9%, that was up 2 percentage points from the first quarter, reflecting seasonal impacts but down versus the prior year.", "In our contractor supplies line of business, revenue was down 44%, that reflects a soft environment but it also reflects our strategy of repositioning contractor supplies to make it complementary of our rental business rather than a standalone business.", "The supplies decline in revenue is the bad news.  The good news is that we're getting a little bit more in margin out of that business.  Gross margins for contractor supplies improved 50 basis points versus the same quarter last year.  And if you look year to date, gross margins in supplies was up 360 basis points versus the same period last year. ", "Used equipment sales again, we already touched on with $84 million of proceeds that was up 24% of last year's proceeds but that reflects the increased level of sales.  The down side is that those sales in this quarter right along a loss of about $8 million.", "When we look at the cost side of things, we already touched on SG&A, so I won't spend any more time there.  But with our cost of rent, we see that as a real opportunity for further cost reductions.  Last year, we spent $1.1 billion on the cost of rental \u2013 cost of rent when you exclude depreciation.  ", "A little bit on that goes a long way and so we've been focused in a wide variety of areas on ways to drive down cost of rent.  In the second quarter, we delivered a [save] versus prior year of $69 million.  That came in a wide range of areas including labor, benefits, facilities cost, insurance again on down the line, it's across the spectrum.", "We're continuing to look for other opportunities by streamlining, simplifying, automating wherever we can and we'll continue to drive those kinds of ideas to realize even greater savings.  In fact, so far through this year, we've got enough confidence and visibility on our ability to save cost of rent that we set out the new target that we've touched on already.  ", "Cost of rent this year we expect to be down between $190 million and $210 million for the year.  That's all I wanted to say on cost.  Just real briefly on EBITDA, when you put it all together, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $150 million, that's at a margin of 24.4%.", "Obviously down significantly from last year.  Last year in the second quarter, EBITDA on our same basis was 32.4%.  Not where we want to be in the least.  We're driving a number of initiatives to address that.  Mike's touched on a lot of them.  I've touched on a lot of them. And we're going to continue to do so in service of driving better performance at EBITDA.  ", "Last thing before I wrap up, wanted to offer a few thoughts on the shelf registration that we filed last night.  If you noticed, you saw that we filed a $1 billion shelf registration covering a wide variety of securities that might be issued from the shelf, including debt, warrants, convertible issues, and equity.  We put that shelf in place as part of our overall capital structure management strategy.  I put it in the category of good financial housekeeping. ", "As you think about managing your capital structure having the ability to execute a transaction, do so quickly off of a shelf is just prudent management and so we put it in place for that purpose.  We don't currently have any plans to draw anything under the shelf.  We will continue to evaluate that as we go forward and let you know as we make decisions on that front.  ", "So those are my comments.  I'd like to turn it back now to the operator for questions and answers.  Operator?", "", "Question-and-Answer session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS. ", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS ", "Wondering if you could chat a little bit about your ability to age the fleet from here?  How far would you be willing to age it and what categories could you age further than others?", "Michael Kneeland", "That's a great question Henry.  We've always said the optimum range would be 35 to 45 months.  Clearly right now, we're at 40.1.  We could conceivably go beyond 45; it's not beyond the realm.  If you look at the current average age today of the industry, it's currently at 44 and a few points above and beyond that.  ", "And as you know, we continue to refurb our equipment and as we refurb we don't re-purpose our asset, we keep it at the original age.  But if you were to do that, obviously our age would come down about three months.  ", "William Plummer", "If I could add, the equipment age is not physics.  It's not like there's a step age at which the equipment \u2013 the average portfolio age starts to really negatively impact us.  It does have an impact on our R&M expense.  That's something that we watch and manage actively.  ", "But we feel very comfortable that we've got flexibility to manage age to significantly longer ages than we set at right now.  And indeed we can go beyond the 45 months that we've talked about as sort of an optimal top end of the range, as Mike said.  How much further beyond, we'd have to trade that off against what are the pressures driving us to age the equipment further.  ", "Michael Kneeland ", "And Henry, one other point on that I think as the industry goes forward you'll continue to see the age of the fleets inside our industry continue to age out.  ", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS ", "That's helpful.  And as you look at the pockets of relative strength could you talk a little more about where within your portfolio you're stating the pockets?  And maybe aside from Canada, which regions are stronger than others? ", "Michael Kneeland ", "Sure.  If you take a look at the Gulf area, Texas is a large state for us.  We're seeing continuous \u2013 let me just step back for a moment and say that the economy's touching all of our regions.  But where we're seeing lesser amount of decline and some pockets of opportunity would be in Texas, eastern Canada as well, still within the Northeast corridor there's still a volume of work that's on the books that still needs to be yet closed out.  ", "Where we're seeing the weakness obviously remains in California, Arizona, Nevada and also in Florida.  By the way, if you take California and Florida that's where we have a large population and a large portion of our business as well.  ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Could we start out on the seasonality of the business?  We saw the uptake but obviously macro is a strong driver as well.  How should we think about third quarter?  Should we anticipate the typically seasonal up tick or is it going to be offset by macro this year? ", "Michael Kneeland ", "Well right now we're seeing the seasonal up tick.  I think it's too early to tell with the macro, it'll play out towards the tail end of the quarter.  If you take a look at the ABI index a year ago clearly towards the tail end of the third quarter you start to see it decline.  We haven't seen that play out yet so it's yet to be determined.  And that's the best scenario that we could just lay out between now and then.  ", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Okay, fair enough.  On pricing \u2013 I'm back a page on my notes I don't recall what you had said.  But I heard something about pilots with the new software.  Can you just take us a little deeper into the progress there as well of the timeline as when you hope to finish? ", "Michael Kneeland ", "Sure.  As you know, at the last quarterly call I talked about that we've engaged a company to work with us to put a software program in to manage rates \u2013 to effectively manage rates and we're going to shift away from just setting rates to more dynamic pricing.  ", "As part of that progress in the second quarter we rolled out 92 locations or pilot throughout North America where we have automated the setting of rates based on logic that we have built.  It'll take a lot of different things into consideration like asset, time and achievable rates that are in the marketplace.  ", "So we're rolling that pilot forward.  As we go into the fourth quarter we would then start shifting towards piloting the dynamic pricing with the opportunity to \u2013 our objective is by the first quarter of next year, in January to roll out a more dynamic pricing model.  ", "And then the last phase would play out to more the national accounts and industrial accounts for just doing price fitting.  So that we can take and look at these prices, long-term contracts and look at how we can determine the profitability in yield on those.  So that's kind of the timeline.  We do have the 92 out there;; it's marching forward, too early to give you the results.  As we go into the third quarter \u2013 the third quarter call we'll be deep into it so I'll be able to give you more details.  ", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "And then with the margin on used equipment sales swinging negative \u2013 and you do have a big chunk of your free cash flow guidance already satisfied through half the year.  But how should we think about your aggressiveness with selling used fleet now, given the fact that it looks like pricing is pretty tough in that market? ", "", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure.  Let me just say that when we went into this year, we had a basis of what we thought we wanted to sell full year.  As we went through the second quarter and I've mentioned on previous calls that there are specific products that we saw weakness in, in particular, 19-foot scissors and some aerial equipment.  They're related more towards retail where I think there's an overcapacity.  ", "When we take a look and march that out against the work that we see and the age of the equipment we determined that we wanted to de-fleet specific categories of equipment inside of our aerial fleet.  We also do a financial analysis as well on those assets to look at the return in cash flow that we would get.  ", "When we started to see \u2013 as we went through first and second quarter we didn't see our pricing in those products improve.  In fact, we saw them weaken.  So we took the liberty of and consciously moved those forward.  So we moved those sales forward in the second quarter.  ", "It was a record sales for us.  To give you the order of magnitude, we sold roughly 5,000 aerial pieces in the second quarter, which is a record and a large number by any stretch of the imagination.  As a result we had to go through the auctions but it was a conscious decision that we made.  We didn't see the pricing improving as time went on, on these older assets.  ", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "So should we anticipate big lump sales again?  Obviously through the auction channel where you're going to get lesser economics or was that a one-time deal and you think it's going to be a little more steady through the end of the year? ", "Michael Kneeland ", "I think it's yet to be determined.  I think that as we go through and determine what the primary market will tell us, and what our customer demand will be, we'll make those decision as we go forward.  We're not prepared to say right today that we've got something that we're going to put out to auction or to extend our auction the order of magnitude that we did before.  But it's one of the levers that we have at our disposal.  And we're not afraid to use it.  ", "William Plummer", "Yes, Scott, I'd only add the fact that we accelerated into the first half, gives us some more flexibility as we look at whatever the market delivers to us in the second half.  So that's good to have in our pocket, but as Mike said, were going to continue to monitor and make decisions based on where the market is, where pricing is, what we see the volume capacity for the market as being and what we think might happen as the end of the year comes closer.  ", "", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Good morning everyone.  A couple of questions, one just the state on the used equipment market.  I guess one think I'm trying to figure out is, do you get the sense that the used equipment market will remain liquid as it has been for the last two or three quarters, or with all the excess capacity what is your likelihood that the used equipment market freezes up?", "", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I think it's very liquid.  I think it really comes down to price, Manish.  The auction market is a lever we can pull and, obviously, I just explained we are not afraid to use it.  But there is still a retail sector that we do retail fleet, and we are retailing our fleet and prices there have been resilient in comparison but just not to the order of magnitude.  ", "You're right.  There is an overcapacity within our industry, and it really determines how much is pushed through at one given moment.  It's fair to say that prices have come down because of the overcapacity and the willingness for companies to put more into the auction arena.  But the auctions itself, to me, is still, and has been, and I see as the foreseeable future, a conduit that will still remain open.  ", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Okay, and secondly as a follow-up, how do you guys think about balancing between selling more equipment versus just parking the equipment for the next upturn?  ", "", "William Plummer", "We've been actually discussing that notion quite a lot over the last month or two among ourselves and with our board, and we've done some analysis to try to get at what the right strategy for a piece of equipment.  Do you rent it?  Do you sell it?  We haven't gone through as detailed analysis the notion of, you just sit on it for some period of time, but that's the next iteration.  ", "In looking at rent versus sell, we've modeled scenarios over various time periods, under various assumptions about what you realize from sale and what you'd be able to rent it out for in a rent scenario, and that's guided thinking about how we're selling equipment and how we might sell equipment in the second half.  We'll continue to do that analysis. ", "As I said, we haven't gotten to that level of detail on the notion of, I'm going to sit on it and wait until things get better at some point in the future.  That strategy introduces even more variables around when might the market come back and what might rental rates look like at that time? And we just haven't gotten to that point in analysis.", "", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Okay, and then just lastly, Bill, since I have you, how much did you guys end up paying for Leasco?", "William Plummer", "We haven't disclosed that.  That amount.  It's a $14 million revenue company.  We're going to stay away from disclosing the price right now.  ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital.  ", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi. Good morning guys.  Thanks for all the detail around the aerial equipment that you sold.  Just as a follow up question.  If you had excluded those 5,000 pieces, would the margins still have been negative?", "Michael Kneeland", "We didn't do the math that way.  We can certainly take it offline and take a look at it, but we didn't break it apart that way.  We'll have to come back to you on that.  ", "", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great and then maybe as a follow-up, and if we have to take that offline that's fine as well, but I was just curious what the average age of that aerial fleet that was sold was?", "", "Michael Kneeland", "The average age of the fleet that we sold in general was 78 months.  So it is safe to say that aerial is one of the oldest assets.", "", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "But that's no different than any point during the cycle, correct?", "", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, we have been attempting, actually been very good from a fleet management standpoint, of selling our oldest assets first as opposed to the newer assets, so we didn't break down the average age by categories of sold.  We just take it as an average overall.", "", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And then just generally, I know that obviously pricing is down and you're implementing this new software, I was just curious how you view your competitors on pricing?  Do you view them as being rational, or are you seeing aggressive strategies?  What's your take on that environment?", "", "Michael Kneeland", "I always get that question and it's a difficult one to answer because there are some companies that are doing some good things and some companies that are rational.  We always try not to point fingers, but the reality of it is the industry, there's companies that are landlocked, that are desperate.  There are companies that are trying to enter new markets, and as a result the only way they do that is lower rates.  ", "I think there is still some irrational pricing going on out there.  In particular companies that are striving to try to find a way, or carve a way, to make it through this down cycle.  The larger companies have the ability to sell fleet, move fleet and go to other markets. ", "One of the things that we do do, because we always get the question on rental rates, as I stated in my opening comments, our rates \u2013 there are no comparable for rates with inside the industry and it's been an open discussion with the American Rental Association.  But one of the things that we do do is we kind of go out and we do some online shopping and try and do some comparisons, based on certain categories of equipment to kind of get a market check to where things are.  ", "And on balance we are either at or on balance with most of the competitors out there.  So we use that as a check and balance.  Again, I am not happy where we are.  And we have \u2013 we need definitive actions, ideas, process management discussions to improve rental rates.  And this industry needs to know, we've got to get an ample return for the capital that we have, whether you're large or small.", "", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "I am trying to figure out the actual cash movement with regard to the refinancing and the debt pay down you did.  If we kind of draw a line below the senior notes, because I understand the 6.5 have a very large negative restrictive payments basket.  There was about $129 million paid down some notes, converts, 14 and [inaudible].  Where did that cash come from?  And second question would be how much cash is sitting at URI, Inc. versus URI,NA?", "", "William Plummer", "The where did the cash come from is that we have, because of the negative restricted payments basket, we have to use cash that is available to URI, United Rentals, Inc.  That cash capacity, let's call it, sits up at URI and it is available to us to do essentially anything that we want or need to do with and that's the cash that we used to repurchase the 7.75 QIPs and other subordinated pieces.  ", "At the end of the second quarter, that cash capacity was $116 million of that the URI level.  So that's the capacity that we have up there after the second quarter after those purchases.  And we continue to manage that cash capacity with the notion that it is the way that we have for buying pieces of debt below the senior level in our capital structure.  Does that make sense?", "", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "That makes total sense.  So when I am looking at the balance sheet, the 125 number, that's the cash United Rentals, North America or is it only the difference between the 116 and the 125, at North America?", "William Plummer", "", "It's the consolidated cash position. It is primarily cash that is held by URNA, the operating entity, and actually most of that cash is resident in Canada, for more detail than you asked for, but it's primarily URNA cash.", "The one thing I should add Phil, as you think about URI's cash capacity, don't think about it as cash that's sitting on the balance sheet.  URI's cash when URI has cash, what we do is we take that cash and make an inter-company loan down to URNA so that URNA can then reduce its ABL balance.", "That's allowed and pulling that cash back up to URI, when URI needs it, is also allowed even with the negative restricted payments basket.", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "And then when you guys were talking about the June and July sequential I guess is month over month increases of rental rates, do you have a sense for the rates in the utilization, what those numbers would be year over year?", "Are we still down 14% year over year or is that percentage year over year declining with the monthly increase in rental rates in June and July?", "William Plummer", "", "I would still be down on a year over year basis but you know we're measuring it sequentially from month to month, kind of showing the progress of where we started after the first quarter going into April, May, and June, and then into July taking the actions that we've taken.", "Yes it'll still be on year over year, looking at a month versus the prior year's same month.  It's still going to be down in the 12%, 13% area.  I don't have the exact numbers Phil, but it's still going to be done year over year, but up sequentially as we said.", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "And is that showing an improvement that year over year month versus month comparison is that showing an improvement?", "William Plummer", "It is, a slight improvement, and hopefully as we get later in the year the comps will get easier, right, as you start to see some declines last year on rates through each month, so hopefully it'll get a little better, but it's a little bit better in July than it was in the second quarter months.", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "Great, and in terms of your industrial business versus your I guess regular commercial or non residential construction business, the rates of decline that you saw there are in terms of total revenue, do you see a material out performance of the industrial business?  Can you give us some numbers around that?", "William Plummer", "We're not talking about that level of detail with numbers.  I think it's fair to say that we still believe industrial represents a good opportunity for us.  That's why we're focused on that customer group.  That's why we made the acquisition, and we'll continue to drive to invest in the areas that offer us the best opportunities.", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay, so is it safe to say Bill, that there's less volatility in that business than there is in just normal non [industry]?", "William Plummer", "Yes, that's a part of why we're attracted to it.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, absolutely it's a longer term play typically to contracts Phil, anywhere between one to three years in duration, and you know there's less volatility in the pricing but that being said our industrial customers are feeling it just like everybody else and they're putting off projects but they will have to come back on line.", "Philip Paselli \u2013 Cantor Fitzgerald", "A last question, if I calculate correctly, your OEC at the end of the quarter was 3.795, is that correct?", "William Plummer", "I don't have the exact number at the quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Chris, can you answer that question?", "Christopher M. Brown", "", "At 3.794.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Following up on two themes, one, just the used equipment market, if you look at the realized price versus the OEC sold, it looks like prices realization went to 31% from 36.4% last quarter.  Is that a change in market prices or is it a change in mix, i.e. the fact that the average age of the fleet that you sold is 78 months.", "William Plummer", "Chris it would be both.  It would be both, the mix that you put out there, the type of products that you have, and also the amount that we put through, and also having more at auction versus any other format that we have available to us.", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "You think that used equipment prices in general are declining?", "William Plummer", "I think that used prices are yes, under pressure to decline as I mentioned earlier it would have been niche, you still have a lot of companies that are trying to de-fleet, and are going to go through this.  ", "So I think for some period of time they will be under pressure.  Having said that, I think that as we start seeing some of the sting less, you may see some categories begin to improve such as earthmoving equipment first, and then we'll progress forward.", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "And Bill, define, I guess, could you talk a little bit about your philosophy in terms of optimizing the balance sheet.  I mean one, I just want to clarify, you said that you had $116 million of availability.  I wonder if that's sort of an inter-quarter period, because if you look at your balance sheet there was actually the amount due to the parent was $170 million. ", "What's the difference between the $170 million and the $116 million?", " William Plummer", "Okay, my apologies so I'll correct my previous number.  If you look in our guarantor statements on note eight in the queue that we filed under the parent column you'll see the intercompany receivable and that number is $170, not $116 \u2013 shouldn't do this on the fly, so again, my apologies.  So, $170 million is the amount of cash capacity that we have available at URI, at the end of the second quarter.", "Chris ask me your question again, or did that answer it?", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "No, that was sort of \u2013 I wanted clarifying goes to sort of your philosophy in terms of managing the balance sheet with possible re-purchases.  If you look at your liquidity just under the revolver you have about $760 million of availability, which if you look at the largest your fleet has been recently, it's like $4.4 billion, just under, and now you're at $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion.  ", "That tells you that you probably have enough liquidity to ramp back up when the market comes down.", "So would your philosophy be to use whatever excess capacity or whatever excess cash flow you have right now to pay down debt at a discount?", "William Plummer", "", "Certainly our philosophy is using pre-cash flow currently to pay down debt.  Whether we do it at a discount or not will just depend on the ebb and flow of what's available, where's the liquidity, what are the yields available to us.", "Certainly we'd prefer buying components of our capital structure at a discount.   In order to do that, as I described with Phil's question, we have to use the discounted pieces of our capital structure are primarily the subordinated pieces, and so in order to buy those we would have to use part of that $170 million of cash capacity at URI.", "We want to manage that prudently.  We want to make sure that we've got the ability to have some dry powder to buy subordinated pieces of our capital structure over time.  So we've got to keep an eye on that cash capacity number as we buy discounted pieces, but certainly buying discounted or buying even pieces of our capital structure that are near par is part of our strategy for deploying free cash flow.", "Chris Doherty \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co", "Basically what you're saying \u2013 not to put words in your mouth, but as a former treasurer type person, you would be looking at possibly calling 14 versus maybe buying 7.75 if the yield was sort of more on the 14 just because it makes sense to buy higher cost debt.", "William Plummer", "That would be the mind set.  You know the question then would be, does doing either make sense relative to other opportunities that we have.  I know I'm not giving you a hard and fast answer but that's really how we think about it is, what is the range of opportunities that we have, what do we get when we buy a given piece, and what do we give to do it.", "So we may decide you know what, I'd love to buy either 7, or 7.75, or 14s, but I still want to knock down that 2012 maturity of 6.50.  I may want to buy some of those, or you know what, I want to build a little bit more liquidity because I think there's a roaring recovery coming so I want to pay down some ABL. ", "We've got to factor in all of those business considerations as well as just sort of the pure market/treasury considerations that may be natural for myself or [Irene], our treasurer.", "Operator", "Thank you.  This does conclude the question and answer session for today's program.  I'd like to turn the program back to Michael Kneeland.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks operator, and I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and participating in the call.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team. ", "I want to start with a quick overview of the results we reported last night, and then focus on the metrics that indicate changes that are starting to take effect in our markets and within our company. I'll talk about the drivers of change, the seasonal, cyclical and our strategy in particular, and share some insights into what kind of demand we expect to see over the next six to 12 months. But still too early to speak in absolutes, but the second quarter did shed some light on the cycle", "As you saw in our press release, we had a strong quarter. The environment is better. Our strategy is taking hold. We're more optimistic than we have been for some time, and we appear to be seeing the early stages of an upturn. And while we continue to bear down on cost, our focus is now on growing the business. So let's start with the results", "We made money in the second quarter. Last year, revenues were slightly higher in the period but gross profit was lower and earnings per share was negative. So it's clear that we've improved the business from top to bottom. EBITDA is up. We reported a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter from 24.4% last year to 32.1% this year. There's a lot of discipline behind those numbers starting with the revenue line.", "Our rental revenues outperformed the operating environment in the second quarter. Total non-residential construction spending, which includes both private and public construction was down 16.1% in April year-over-year and down 15.2% in May. And you compare that to our rental revenues, which were down less than 1% for the quarter. At the same time, our same-store rental revenues were actually up 2.7%. So going hard after the business that's out there, implementing our market strategy, identifying and going after the right types of customers and winning more profitable jobs, but we're staying very aware of the quality of our revenues, not just the quantity. We'll talk more about our strategy in just a moment", "Now on the cost side, we took $11 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to the second quarter last year. We also brought down our cost of equipment rentals x depreciation by $4 million. Bill will talk in just a moment about where we are in these initiatives and what we see for the balance of the year. With CapEx, we've a lot of bandwidth to react to the market conditions. We bought $125 million of new fleet in the second quarter. We also sold $80 million of used OEC at 24.3% margin. And we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion of fleet with an average age of 45 months.", "So we're very disciplined around the use of our capital and CapEx. At the same time, managing our liquidity very carefully and despite buying more fleet then we originally planned, still generated positive free cash flow of $8 million in the quarter. ", "Now I'll spend a few minutes to talk about the two dynamics that drive our numbers. Rental rates and utilization. As you saw, rates were down 2% in the quarter year-over-year. Still a lot of pressure on pricing out there but if you dissect the quarter, the sequential trends are promising. We are continuing to focus very intensely on rates. It's a huge priority for our business, and I would say for the industry as well. ", "We estimate that every point of rate is worth about $18 million of annual EBITDA to us, so I can assure you we're doing everything in our power to reverse the year-over-year trend on rates. Our approach is very informed and very disciplined. We're working to achieve the optimal price on every contract. We're also walking away from unprofitable deals and we're implementing the price optimization software, which we call core, which if you recall is about dynamic pricing, each price subject to that type of customer. The core is currently rolled out to 75% of our branches and we'll complete it by the end of August. Right now, short-term transactional business is trending upwards as it always does in the spring and summer. Smaller construction projects coming on line, they typically are daily and weekly rentals and they involve less price negotiation, better rates", "In the second quarter, about 70% of our business was monthly. Monthly rates are always going to recover last because equipment stays out for longer periods of time at fixed rates. Monthly rates are still a good long-term strategy for us and are more profitable over time, but they also recover last. Still, 30% of our districts in the U.S. and Canada showed a year-over-year rate improvement in the second quarter", "The other dynamic I mentioned is utilization. As you know, a combination of rates and time utilization drive dollar utilization in our business. Yesterday, we reported a record second quarter time utilization of 65.4%. Our dollar utilization increased to 46.7%, which is 1.8 percentage points higher than last year. It's worth noting that we had $40 million of original equipment [ph] (22:34) cost on rent more compared to last year. And even though the average size of our fleet actually decreased by $186 million. ", "So where's demand coming from? We believe that we're seeing the early stages of a cyclical uptick on top of the normal seasonal benefit. The tight credit markets are also helping us with our access to capital, more contractors are renting equipment as opposed to buying it. And from a macro standpoint, we're definitely seeing more spending in public construction. The public transportation sector in particular is showing year-over-year growth in spending --", "Residential construction is recovering in some trade areas but it's not a big market for us, but everything else. Infrastructure jobs are now beginning to come online and energy and hospital construction is holding steady. The weak link is commercial construction. There's very little activity and we expect it to recover last. Now taking a look at it from a geography standpoint, our key indicator is same-store rental revenue and six of our nine operating regions showed a year-over-year growth in the second quarter. Canada continues to be strong especially northeast Canada. And in the U.S., we're seeing activity increased by trade area rather than broad regional patterns. But revenues increased in parts of the Southeast driven by demand for general construction equipment. And the Southeast had year-over-year growth and rental revenues", "In the Gulf, we saw choppy growth and the region, as a whole, is basically flat. However, if you set aside the impact of Mexico, which we sold the Briggs halfway through the quarter, rental revenue for the Gulf was actually up year-over-year. Now our weakest geographies are still the Southwest and some of the markets to the central part of the U.S., although we're beginning to see pockets of opportunity in both those regions", "Now I want to mention our Trench, Power and HVAC business, which reported a 13% increase in rental revenues in the second quarter; obviously, getting a boost from stimulus spending. Our Trench business has equipment currently, today, on 194 stimulus jobs. They're mostly infrastructure projects and we expect to see stimulus spending last for at least another 12 months or maybe longer", "The Power and HVAC rentals is a growth area for us in that business. Our teams responded to floods this spring in Rhode Island and Tennessee and we're currently, supplying power and climate control to  a number of cleanup camps in the Gulf. Right now, we're averaging approximately $250,000 of rental revenues per month related to the oil spill. So basically, it's very choppy out there but things are getting better. We can sense it in the field as well. Customers are telling us they're bidding more jobs although it's still extremely competitive. Now we're cautiously optimistic but a little less cautious and more optimistic than we were in April. ", "At the same time, we're not relying on the external environment. we're taking control by driving some of the performance from the inside, using our customer segmentation strategy to focus on building relationships with large construction and industrial customers service to our single point of contact. And we know from experience that large customers are less cyclical and more stable. They appreciate our broad footprint across North America and they almost have an untapped share of wallet that we could earn at a lower cost.", "Now we signed 130 new National Accounts to June 30. Now 40% of those were industrial accounts. Now as you can see, we're moving closer to our goal of 30% of revenue from the industrial market. It will take some time to get there but each quarter brings us closer and I have all the confidence that we'll achieve our goal. Now segmentation is a larger part of our go-to-market strategy called, \"Operation United\". It includes optimization of our fleet footprint, corporate operations and most importantly, our customer service capabilities", "Now I said many times, service is a critical differentiator for us, particularly in our industry. If we get service right, the revenues will follow. And we received some good news with service recently with our net promoter store. They told the customers, especially larger customers, are recognizing how committed we are to customer service. That's gratifying for our employees because they're the ones on the front lines driving customer satisfaction.", "Now I mentioned that we're pivoting the company toward revenue generation. That's going to be the story going forward, it's about growth and value creation. In addition to segmentation, we have a number of revenue initiatives underway, some of which I started talking about in the first quarter. An aggressive push to new business. In the second quarter, we signed 6,600 new accounts. That's a 25% increase over last year. We also reactivated dormant accounts, and year-to-date, we reactivated 6,100 dormant accounts and generated $16 million of rental revenue from this group alone. And we continue to optimize our branch footprint, positioning our branches in promising markets where they have the opportunity to perform well. And we're close to consolidate at 10 branches in the second quarter. ", "However, we also opened two new cold starts and we didn't exit any markets in that process. Now we also intend to grow our power HVAC presence this year and into next. So as you can see, all the various parts of our strategy are starting to mesh. And our employees have been exceptional in pursuit to this goals. Our second quarter performance is really a credit to their hard work, great attitude and their professionalism. They really embraced our strategy. It's only appropriate I want to tip my hat to all the employees who are on this call today, and they deserve it.", "Now so to summarize, we said in April that we believe the first quarter was the lowest point in the cycle and so far, that appears to be true. Now I want to be very candid with everyone. This is an environment that is still uncertain. there are challenges but things are getting better. The second quarter started well, we got better as we moved through the quarter. Construction spending is still spongy and our activity will shift up and down for a little. But our current advantage point today, we expect many of our end markets to show modest growth as the year progresses moving toward a broader recovery in 2011 and 2012. So when you look at our second quarter performance in this context, frankly, we're very encouraged. ", "Now in that note, we'll now shift you over to Bill to review our results and then, we'll take your questions after that. So over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll give a little bit more detail on the financial results for the quarter and then I'll update our outlook for the remainder of the year. ", "First, looking at our revenue performance, in the Rental line of business, as Mike said, this was a strong quarter for us. No revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. And as you'd expect, it's about the interplay of fleet size, fleet utilization and rental rates. On the fleet side of things, the average size of our fleet was down by about 5% in the quarter compared to last year. But despite that smaller fleet, we were able to put more OEC on rent. OEC on rent for the quarter was actually up by 2% versus last year in the quarter", "So more OEC on rent, smaller fleet size, put them together and you get what was really impressive time utilization for the quarter. 65.4% is a record for the company in the second quarter. That's up 4.1 percentage points versus last year and as we look closer at that increase, we saw very nice improvement in certain key categories. ", "Earthmoving equipment, for example, was particularly strong. The OEC on rent, dollars for earthmoving equipment for the quarter was up 11% compared to last year. So that helped drive that overall 2% improvement in OEC on rent. And we take heart from that because, as you know, earthmoving equipment tends to be earlier in the cycle when things are improving.", "While when we look at our rental rates, as Mike mentioned, we were down 2% year-over-year on rental rate. Although on a sequential basis, the second quarter was about flat with the first quarter of this year. As you look within that and take a look at each month sequential improvement during the quarter, it was an improvement. So every month in the second quarter was better than the prior month in the second quarter. And that follows the first quarter where the pattern was the opposite. In the first quarter, every month sequentially was a little worse than the prior month. That turned around in the second quarter, and so the net effect in the quarter was a quarter that was sequentially flat with the first quarter. By the way, that string of sequential month improvements in the second quarter so far continues into July. ", "So you put that rate performance together, and while rates are not where we want to be long-term, the trend is positive. And it fits with the view that we've expressed about the sequence of a recovery. So first, we expected to see used equipment prices recover. That's been going on according routes and others. Then you'd expect to see utilization rebound. Certainly, you'd have to say that we got a nice rebound utilization. And then we expect to see rates improve. Hopefully we're at the early stage of a sustained improvement in rates", "When you look at rates on a full-year basis, we're still saying what we said at the last quarter. We expect the full-year rate performance to be only modestly down. We're still calling it down something in the low single digits compared to the year. ", "When you look at our used equipment activities this quarter, we generated $37 million of proceeds from our used equipment sales. And though that's down significantly from last year, remember last year in the second quarter, we were aggressively downsizing the fleet. And so we were selling a lot of equipment. We sold $271 million of OEC last year compared to only $80 million of OEC this year. ", "Our margins have shown a dramatic improvement. The 24.3% margin that we realized in the second quarter compares to a negative 9.5% last year. That margin performance reflects both a shift in channels and also overall an improved pricing. In terms of channel mix, our retail contribution was 60% this quarter. That compares to only 26% last year", "From the flip side, the option channel this quarter was only 22% and that compares to 52% option last year. Pricing meanwhile has improved across nearly all categories and that certainly is reflected in the activity that we're seeing in the used market. And you can see that in external sources such as Ralph's reports.", "Turning to our cost performance, Mike mentioned we delivered $11 million of SG&A reduction this quarter. And consistent with what we've seen over the last number of quarters, that reduction came across the great majority of lines within SG&A. In particular, we had benefits in salaries and benefit expense. Those came down in line with headcount reductions that we've realized since last year. We also had a nice quarter in professional fee reductions. We've been more disciplined and focused on use of service providers and professional fees came down nicely as a result. But we also had contributions in the SG&A save from many other lines as well.", "So given the trends that we've seen, even though the top line performance is stronger than what we expected earlier in the year, and therefore there's going to be pressure on selling cost, even with all that, we still are comfortable reaffirming our target for $40 million to $50 million of full year SG&A reductions. And as always, we'll keep looking for more and drive that as much as we possibly can.", "On the cost of rent lines excluding depreciation, that story is a little bit more complex. We did reduce cost to rent x depreciation by $4 million versus last year. And within that, salary and benefit cost were our main driver. Again, headcount reductions being a main component there. We also had lower facility cost as we see some of the impact of the closures that we've had since last year. But when you look at the full year for cost of rent, we're taking down our estimate for the full year reduction by about $40 million. So right now, we're looking for full year savings and cost of rent in the range of $30 million to $50 million", "That's not great news on the surface but there are some real positives when you look into the details. That reduction in the expected save really has driven by variable cost that flow from higher volume. We got more rental transactions than we expected. We're running at a higher time utilization than we expected. We've got more OEC on rent as a result and so you put all that together and the variable cost components are going to be higher. And so our ability to save versus last year is reduced. In particular, repair and maintenance expense, delivery expense and overtime are the biggest drivers of our revised outlook.", "Turning to EBITDA and EPS performance, first on EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA up for the quarter was $179 million and that was at a margin of 32.1%. Very nice improvement in the margins, 770 basis points versus last year. That's especially significant given that our total revenues were down 9%. ", "Although 32% is not where we want to be long term, it certainly is a significant improvement and it gives a sense of a very nice operating leverage that we're building into the business as we focus on driving those key customer relationships and continuing to manage cost. In fact, to put it into some perspective, 32.1% margin this quarter is higher than the second quarter margin that we achieved in the second quarter of 2007. And arguably, you could call that the peak of the last cycle. So we feel good about the EBITDA performance we delivered this year.", "Looking at EPS, we delivered EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.18 in the quarter. And as we noted on the release last night, that $0.18 includes the effect of a tax benefit of $9 million taken in the second quarter. That benefit arises out of a change in our full year projection. As we look at the full year now and we calculate the expected tax that we will have to provide over the course of the year, we get an effective tax rate for the full year of about 55%. And as we apply that 55% rate to the first half performance as GAAP requires, it resulted in the benefit that you saw in the second quarter", "Even when you adjust for that tax matter by the way, we still feel good about the quarter that we just delivered overall. The only other point I'll make on EPS is that the number of shares and the diluted EPS calculation went up as we went into a positive net income. You have to include more share. So the share count for the quarter was 68 million shares in the diluted EPS calculation ", "Now some thoughts on our fleet. We continue to drive our fleet strategy. First, on leveraging the existing fleet to the max, we're transferring fleet as we have been for the last several years. We're transferring fleet very aggressively. We transferred $1.6 billion in fleet in total in the quarter. That's about 42% of our overall fleet moving around during the course of the quarter. We continue to execute our life cycle management approach by selling older equipment from our fleet. Our used sales during the quarter were made at an average age of 71 months. And again, that's consistent with our view that we should be selling the older equipment as we manage the fleet to be more effective for our customers. By the way, that 71 months is slightly lower than it's been over the last few quarters, and that really reflects the impact of the sale of equipment in Mexico. The average age of the equipment that we sold in Mexico was a little less than normal. If you strip out Mexico, the average age of the other fleet that we sold is about 74 months, not significantly different", "In terms of our rental spend, we spent $125 million of gross rental CapEx in the quarter. And we're buying categories with that spend that we expect to perform well in the near term. So for instance, we're buying forklifts, we're buying light towers, compressors, excavators, really a host of general rental and earthmoving products and skewing away from aerial products in the spend. We are spending a little bit on aerial but doing so in specific categories like big booms, which are still in good demand.", "We're also buying categories, quite honestly, that fit with the demand we're seeing from our customer groups. As we look at specific customers and specific projects and we have visibility to the fleet that's needed to support those, we've been spending more money on those types of situations. ", "In terms of our full-year CapEx expectations and given the strong demand that we're seeing and couple that with the focus that we have on support in the key accounts, we decided that we should raise our outlook for full year net rental CapEx. We're now expecting to spend between $160 million to $180 million of net rental CapEx. That's up $60 million from our prior range.", "And as I mentioned, that strong demand that we're seeing is expected to continue into the back half, and we are confident that as we do put that new CapEx into our fleet, that we'll be able to put that fleet on rent right away. So that's our strategy on fleet. We're going to target the spend on specific categories. We're going to support specific accounts, and we're going to really focus on driving returns out of the investment", "A couple of real brief thoughts on free cash flow. We generated $8 million of free cash flow in the quarter and, while that may not seem like a big number, it's impressive given our fleet spend that I just spent some time on. We think our full year, when you put all together the time utilization, the impact of our cost of rent changes, the greater fleet spend, the full year free cash flow still feels good to us at $200 million to $225 million. So we're maintaining our forecast for $200 million  to $225 million for the year. And as always, we're going to look for more and we'll share it to you as we identify it.", "Real briefly and lastly on liquidity, we maintain a very strong liquidity position. At the end of the quarter, we had $800 million of total liquidity. Principally that was from availability under our ABL Facility, so we're well-positioned to be able to support whatever capital investment need that we identify.", "So those are my key comments on the quarter. I'll stop talking, open it up for Q&A right now. But before we do that, I guess I'll just reemphasize that as we look at this quarter, it was a strong quarter and we feel very good about what we are able to deliver. Continue to be cautious about our outlook going forward but we're going to be there to take full advantage of whatever the market offers to us. ", "So I'll stop there and ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Henry Kirn with UBS.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "Wondering if you could chat about rate improvement by equipment category and by geography?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, we don't have the specific geographies to outline it. What I would say is the way that we saw the levels of activity that I went through on in geography amount, which would be in Canada, particularly in northeast Canada, and then pockets where we saw the year-over-year improvement. That's kind of where you would land on where the rate improvements were seen. As far as categories, I don't necessarily know that we broken them down to specific categories, unless -- Bill, you got that?", "William Plummer", "We haven't talked, Henry, specifically about rate changes by categories. I think it's fair to say that the level of demand that we're seeing in some of the key categories would support higher rates. I'll stop there.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "Is there any way to categorize or quantify the stimulus benefit in the quarter? And how much visibility do you have on the stimulus as we go into the back half of the year and into 2011?", "Michael Kneeland", "Obviously, we've always said that as the stimulus dollars came forward and that projects started to break ground, the first area that we would see the benefit would be our Trench business, and that seems to be holding through. As you know, there's 32,000 projects that are related to the American Recovery Act [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act] that value $195 billion. 72% of those have been funded. It's broken down to various buckets, transportation, utilities, water infrastructure. Actually, the Trench segment alone is tracking, in pipeline alone, around 1,100 projects. They've got about 821 non-building projects, and they also have 153 projects that are non-residential that they're tracking. So as we go through -- the 194 projects are worth about $3 billion in value, and we estimate that we would generate somewhere around $3 million of revenue on those projects alone. It's coming. It has taken a while to come online, and we expect that to continue to go up from here and peak in 2011. I hope that I answered your question.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "Could you chat about if the competitive dynamic stay as where the outset of the cycle held, how the nationwide competition looks compared to either a couple of years ago or at the outset of the last cycle?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I mean obviously, as you know, and this has been a very, very stressful downturn for the industry. Rates have come down and some of the regional players, as we all expected, felt the brunt of it. I would tell you that as we go forward, we're seeing the volume increase that we experienced in the second quarter. My sense is that our competitors will respond as well. I think there's an inherent need of our industry to get a better return on this capital, and we all need to focus more acutely on rates, and I think that will play out over time. Again, we went through a bad cycle. We started to get our fleets right sized across all of the players, sold off a lot in last year. Used prices were affected. Used prices seem to rebound and continue to hold, as Bill mentioned and all the reports that we're seeing from Ralph's [ph] and others plus ourselves. And then we're now seeing volume increases or time utilization improvements, which is the sequence that we said would play out is holding through. So my sense is it's still competitive out there, and there's pockets where we fight everyday. It's not easy, I understand that, and we all have to go out there and try to earn the best dollar we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Bill, do you have a rule of thumb for incremental margin or flow through for each of additional dollar of rental revenue? Is there a way we can think about that?", "William Plummer", "So as we talk about it internally, we generally talked about something like 70% flow through on the rental line. You'll note that the flow through on the improvement in the second quarter was better than that, and that reflects some of the cost actions that we've taken and the volume leverage that we're getting with improved OEC going on, on rent. But general, 70% kind of number, maybe 65% just to hedge a little bit, would be a general rule that you might use.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "With regard to CapEx, incremental CapEx spend decisions, how do you guys look at that? Could you speak a little bit to what it takes to maintain the fleet age, where you are with the fleet age, where you're comfortable going, where you've been historically with CapEx, just some color around that topic.", "William Plummer", "So 45 months today, and what we've said about this year is that we can see it going into the high 40s. So call it between 47 and 49, 48 if you insist on a point of estimate. What we said is that we don't feel uncomfortable at that level even though it's higher than the optimum range that we talked about historically. Historically, we've talked about a 35- to 45-month optimum range. But operating in the high 40s or even low 50s, even mid-50s would not impact our ability to generate revenue. We're very convinced of that. In fact, again, if you refer to Ralph's about the industry data, Ralph's would tell you that the average rental fleet is already north of 50 months in average age. So we feel comfortable with what we've got on the plate for this year. Next year, we haven't sat down and really nailed a view of where the fleet age is going to go next year. And so we'll certainly talk about it as we get further into our planning process for next year. What I will say is that as a rule of thumb, in order to maintain the size and the age of our fleet constant through a course of a year, we would have to spend about $575 million gross rental CapEx. And obviously, the net would be less than that as you assume some reasonable amount of new sales, so $575 million gross to keep age and size constant across the year. And that will inform how we think about our spend is going forward.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Could you update us on Industrial business, how that's developing? I think it's a 30% target mix, just how are all the dynamics are affecting mix and ratio?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. This is Mike, Scott. Our industrial progress continues to march forward. If we take a look at the percentage, it's around 19%, up two percentage points on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. We continue to add more contracts. As I mentioned in our National Accounts, 40% of our signed National Accounts are industrial related. It takes a while to ramp those up, very happy with that. Our rental revenue alone is up 3.5%. So we continue to march forward, and very happy with our progress. We're earning more business everyday. And as Bill mentioned on the capital, you can imagine more some of the capitals going for these longer-term profitable deals, and we're going to react to those.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Actually, just to clarify what you just said Mike, did you say that the industrial rental revenues were up 3.5% for the quarter?", "William Plummer", "Yes, year-over-year, from Q2 '09 to Q2 '10.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And is that the same, or the National Accounts up as well?", "William Plummer", "Our National Accounts, collectively, are up 6%.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "On the pricing, I think last quarter, you gave some monthly visibility to how the numbers trended through the quarter. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to do that this quarter for April, May, June. Really, what I'm trying to understand is, did June turned positive? I think March ended up -- it was kind of down 4% or so, 4.5%.", "William Plummer", "So last quarter, we gave the monthly year-over-year changes, so I'll just repeat that. For April, year-over-year, April was down 2.6%. May was down 1.8%. June was down 1.1%.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "And you said trends have continued into July then?", "William Plummer", "My comment was about the sequential trends in July, but I think it's fair to say that July is doing well. The problem with July on a year-over-year comparison is last year, July was a blowout month in terms of year-over-year positive. It was up last year, so the comp is covered [ph]. So tune in three months from now, you can ask me about the three months and the third quarter, and we can talk about July then, especially since it'll be done then instead of 2/3 from now.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "But just directionally, I assume you'd expect to see the same sequential margin improvement that you usually see in the Rental business from the second quarter to the third quarter. Is that fair?", "William Plummer", "I don't see anything that would keep us from having a normal sequential margin improvement in the third quarter.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Just switching over, your aerial utilization is actually up, I think up to 70% or so this quarter. How high can you really push that? I mean, it sound like you're not drawing a lot of CapEx at that space, but your time utilization is over 70% for Booms and Lifts. So what's the kind of the trigger point there?", "Michael Kneeland", "I mean, obviously, Seth, we can run aerial at a higher time utilization. Yes, it's up and it's expected, what you see in the seasonal aspect of the business. Also keep in mind that we have also had de-fleeting, and we're changing our mix. And if you see the investor presentation, it's down a couple of points. The capital that we're spending year-to-date, as Bill mentioned, year-to-date, we've only spent 21% of our CapEx towards aerial. The rest is going to our other product lines. Our time utilization, to answer your question specifically, I find it unusual to get it into the 80s. It's challenging, but it's not unusual. It'll peak out over the course of the third quarter. So I wouldn't be surprised to see that go up a little bit as we went through into the third quarter. Having said that, there are pockets. As Bill mentioned, bigger booms, higher demand, then some of the other products that are related towards commercial construction, small scissor lifts and bigger scissor lifts towards big box. So it's a balancing act.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Last quarter, you gave us, I think you called out $10 million of the CapEx was dedicated to strategic opportunities. Is it possible to clarify how much of this extra $60 million is going towards the strategics?", "William Plummer", "Yes, I think it's fair to say -- well, first, the extra $60 million is across the entire year. But at least half, let's just say at least half of the incremental spend is against specific strategic customers or projects that we've identified.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Wells with Thompson Research.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "First off, just looking at the expectations that you've outlined previously for kind of a cyclical peak number of a 40% EBITDA margin, given the performance that you've seen out of the business in the quarter and the recovery in margins, how are you thinking about that number now, relative to where you were thinking about it two, three months ago?", "William Plummer", "We still feel very comfortable that we can achieve a 40% EBITDA margin. After this quarter, I guess I'd say, there's some uncertainty around some of the assumptions underneath that 40% cyclical number. We feel less uncertain about some of those assumptions. For example, remember, we said that number assumes a 67% utilization across the whole year. Well, we just delivered a great second quarter, and that gives us more confidence in our ability to hit a full year 67%. So we feel very comfortable with the 40%, and we feel more comfortable today than we did when we first put it out.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "And then just coming back to an earlier question about stimulus-related projects, given the number of projects that you're tracking, and I believe it's something around $100 billion of construction spend that's not tied to highway specifically, do you feel like those projects alone could offset any continued increases in your kind of more traditional commercial forms of non-res [non-residential] construction as we go into the 2011 time period?", "Michael Kneeland", "It's really hard to pinpoint that, David. The question of timing, the timing of when these projects start, how they start. Certainly, it's value-added, and we'll take it to offset any of the declines that we've seen in the primary end market but it's really hard to quantify it in that form.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "And then on the National Account front within the new accounts that you're signing, any sense -- are these National Accounts signing a national agreement for the first time with United Rentals, or are you picking up shares from other competitors that maybe have faltered here in the downturn? Any sense of where the business is coming from?", "Michael Kneeland", "It's coming from both. We're taking some people have faltered, some people are looking at more streamlined and larger players versus the smaller players. We have capital to go after some of these projects with them, and the consistency levels of service that we're providing for them. And I will also say the success we're having with a single point of contact, so it's both.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "I noticed in the presentation posted that you had upped your expectation for the permanency of your cost savings from 50%-ish, kind of a 50% range to 55%. What changed as you looked at those costs that you have taken out? Is it kind of the systems that you put into place that you feel like you can keep some of those cost out of the business? Any color there would be helpful.", "William Plummer", "You're catching me at a little bit of a disadvantage. Did we change the timeframe over the phase?", "Michael Kneeland", "No, it's 55%, David. It's the same number we had before. It's 55%, and it was still holding through.", "William Plummer", "I think at one point, we were saying about 50% and as we sharpened the precision around some of the numbers, I think we settled around 55%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Doherty with Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Doherty", "Just a question in terms of the fleet size and your expectations for value. You upped the CapEx guidance, but in terms of talking about target utilization, you're still quite below that 67% plus, is the expectation that you're going to maintain the fleet size and focus more on driving rental rates at this point?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I think it's a combination of both, one of which is accounts that we're signing, which will provide us with longer-term duration, we want to make sure that we have the fleet in order to achieve their expectations, that's one. But obviously, yes, we want to get rates up. I mean, the rates is first and foremost on my mind, and anyone of my senior managers, the first thing on their mind as well. Are they looking for more capital? Absolutely. Are we giving it to them? No. We're going to be very selective and have a lot of discipline around where we spend our capital and how we spend our capital. So everyday, we're fighting on rate, and we're going to continue to march towards that number.", "William Plummer", "Chris, just to put it, your question kind of framed in the context of the 67% utilization goal, if you will. And I think it's fair to say that in the context of that analysis we did for the peak EBITDA margin performance, we did remember -- assume that the fleet size will increase over that time horizon, whatever it is. But we assume that it would do so in context with rates going up as well. And so that was the exercise that we went through then. As we look at what we're doing today and in the near term, it's everything that Mike just said. We want to make sure that we're making decisions about the fleet size that support our ability to drive rate, to drive utilization, to drive return, and we're going to be looking at that everywhere.", "Christopher Doherty", "And then so in terms of the operating leverage in the business, when do you think you have or have you achieved sort of the run rate cost savings? And I think you sort of brought this up, but I mean, one of the things I was impressed with this quarter was if you look quarter-over-quarter, implied volume was up about 16%, but yet your rental cost only increased by $3 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter which I think is a pretty good operating leverage metric when things are improving. Was there some additional cost cuts quarter-over-quarter?", "William Plummer", "Yes, I mean, we continue to look at opportunities. And so quarter-over-quarter, we had more headcount reductions, and we had a greater focus on making sure that we're optimizing around our delivery processes. We just continue to challenge ourselves everywhere possible. I think we'll continue to do that, and I think there's opportunity on the cost to rent areas to do more of that as we go forward. Obviously, I always caveat the volume component as to how it impacts our total cost dollars. But in terms of the impact on margin, better volume is going to flow through to better margin for us as long as we're sensible about managing the cost structure. So we're doing the normal things that we do. It had a very nice impact in the second quarter. We're looking for opportunities to keep driving it going forward.", "Christopher Doherty", "And then just one last question and it relates to sort of the guidance where you increased the net CapEx of rental by $60 million but you maintained free cash flow. Are you getting terms on that, or is there some working capital that benefits there, given that you've now increased the usage of cash by $60 million? Or is that just an improvement in EBITDA, your expectations for EBITDA, Bill?", "William Plummer", "I guess I have to say the words, it's certainly mostly an improvement in EBITDA. Some of that gets eaten up with the additional working capital, but there's an improvement in EBITDA, implicit in what we said.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Emily Shanks with Barclays Capital.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "Just if I could start with a quick housekeeping item, for the affirmed guidance of $200 million to $225 million of free cash flow, that includes the $55 million federal tax refund, right?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, it does.", "William Plummer", "Yes.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "And then Mike, in some of your opening comments, you had commented how the tight credit markets are helping demand for your business. I was curious what your view was around tight credit market potential impact on residual values going forward.", "Michael Kneeland", "I haven't looked at it from that perspective, to be quite honest with you. What we look at is there is still a viable used market out there. I don't know where it's impacted. We've gone through tight credit market before, and I haven't seen it where it is impacted. The residual values, I think that if the contractor doesn't have the credit and you see an expansion in the secular side of the business, there's going to be an inherent demand for rental companies to probably add more fleet. Not everyone adds new fleet. A lot of the smaller localized will go to the used market. So I think it will still be a very robust market. Keep in mind that 60% of everything that manufactured still went into ownership. So we're just getting a bigger slice of that pie.", "William Plummer", "I think about it very simply. If credits' tight and people can't find financing to buy their own equipment, then that means that they're going to be demanding our equipment and there's going to be less used on the market, and that should support residual values overall. So I hadn't thought about it. I'm like Mike, I haven't thought about it from a prospective of residual values, but I could very quickly convince myself that that's not something I'd be concerned about.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "I just wanted to ask, and this is maybe a question for Bill, around the Canadian inter-loan cash movement. I just wanted to understand the 160-ish million that moved, was that the cash that was used for the open-market repurchases of the bond? And then secondarily, can we still look at that $55 million intercompany receivable between URNA and URI as the amount that you can use towards future bond repurchases, or should we be looking at another bucket? I wasn't sure how the two are related.", "William Plummer", "The intercompany loan, Canada to U.S., I think you should think about it separately, then the intercompany loan, URI to URNA. The intercompany loan from Canada to the U.S. is strictly a cash management move where we bring the money back into the U.S. temporarily to keep the average balance of our ABL down and certainly, that continues. We'll continue to manage that within the rules set out by the tax authorities. In terms of thinking, and we did not use any of that cash directly from the intercompany Canadian U.S. loan to repurchase the subnotes that we repurchased in the second quarter. On the subnote repurchases, that was done out of URI. It used part of the cash capacity at URI to execute those, and we had to because of the limitations on our restricted payments basket that arises out of various debt facilities. We used roughly $24 million, $25 million of that cash capacity. At the end of the quarter, if you look in the Q and the guarantor statements, you'll see that, that cash capacity stood at about $55 million at the end of the quarter, and so that's what we have available to make further repurchases. A very confusing topic, I hope I cleared it up for you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Volpicelli with Deutsche Bank.", "Philip Volpicelli - Goldman Sachs", "My question is with regard to acquisitions. Clearly, some of the smaller competitors out there are probably facing Chapter 11 or Chapter 7. Are there any fleets out there available for sale that you can pick up at a discount and maybe refurbish? And then I guess as a corollary to that would be in terms of the OEMs, do they have any equipment they've purchased in the open market and have refurbished that might be available to you?", "Michael Kneeland", "The answer is yes. We go out and we buy used equipment on the open market, and we're not partial to [ph] whether its vendors or going to auction, picking things up. So yes, we've taken opportunities to go out there and buy assets. We continue to do that. Our fleet management team is always looking at what's available out there. So yes, we do take a look at it from an acquisition standpoint. Keep in mind, that usually when companies get distressed, the first thing that they fault around is their services. So we're very cautious to make sure if it's the right asset.", "Matt Leach", "And in terms with, I guess, your outlook brightening a little bit and still some free cash flow are strong for your cash flow generation, are you looking to make in tuck-in acquisitions or would you consider a larger acquisition?", "William Plummer", "I think that we always get that question. So the caution is around -- this is a company that as you know, was founded on acquisitions, and grew up in that era. It has to be strategic, whether it's large or small or medium. It has to be strategic with our long-term vision, and that is expanding our geographic -- our diversity around our customer mix. We just don't need to add more physical locations. We don't need to add it to every market. We're in 99 in the 100 markets with the exception of Hawaii. It has to be strategic. Are we open to it? Yes, we'll always look at it. But again, the discipline around is making sure it is our longer term strategy.", "Matt Leach", "With regard to maintenance expenses, is there kind of like a cliff where if equipment gets above a certain average age that, that maintenance goes up dramatically? Or maybe as a different way, can you give us a sense of as month, the fleet gets older, whether that equates to in more maintenance cost?", "William Plummer", "To your first question, there's not a cliff. It is not a point where it dramatically rises. What we think about is, as a rule of thumb, something like an incremental $2 million to $3 million a year for an extra month of age on the fleet. So a month maintained over a year will cost you another $2 million to $3 million of incremental R&M. That number does arise a little bit as you get older, but it's not like it goes to 10 to 12, as you go from 45 to 50 months, say.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. First of all, I want to thank everybody for joining us today.

The company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

You can access these filings on the company\u2019s website at www.ur.com.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks operator and good morning everyone and welcome. On the call as the operator stated is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team.", "I\u2019m going to start this morning by summarizing the quarter for you particularly those metrics that relate to our strategy. I want to focus our discussion on the tie end between our strategy, our actions and our results. And I\u2019ll also talk to you about the operating environment and where we see the recovery going next. And then Bill later in the call will discuss \u2013 will cover all these in detail, all the results in detail and then after that, we\u2019ll take all of your questions.", "And so we\u2019ll start with the numbers. As you saw from our press release, we had a strong third quarter. We got some help from the environment in terms of demand, but for the most part we generally got a performance from the inside out by paying close attention to our strategy. As I shared with you in the past, that strategy is to transform the company for long-term profitability by defining on rentals according to our core business of rental, achieving customer service leadership in our industry, continuously improving our cost structure in fleet management, and leveraging our size by pivoting our customer base towards large construction in industrial accounts that we service to a single point of contract.", "And we\u2019re being very disciplined about how we target these accounts while at the same time, pursuing more profitable rentals from our customer base at large. So as a result, we had positive net income of $23 million, and an EPS of $0.33 per share. When you compare that with the third quarter of last year, when we had a net income and earnings of zero. The change is even more dramatic on the adjusted basis with an EPS of $0.40 compared with $0.01 in last year\u2019s third quarter.", "And we\u2019ve repeatedly said that we\u2019re only interested in profitable growth and here is the evidence. We increased our adjusted EBITDA dollars by 17% even though rental \u2013 total revenues increased by only 2%. Overall gross margin was up 1.9 percentage points for the quarter versus last year. In short, the numbers clearly show that we are delivering on our strategic priorities and we\u2019re doing it within the context of a sharper recovery.", "It\u2019s true, the cycle is turning but it\u2019s a slow turn. And I\u2019m happy to say that our performance has outpaced the construction environment for two straight quarters now. We know the construction spending in the US actually took a step backwards in July and August compared to last year. So I\u2019m happy to report that with ABI numbers that came in last night were actually up the first time since 2008. And we take that as a piece of positive news.", "With our rental revenues were up 6%, with that includes a same-store growth of 9.7%. Now these are all good indicators of how well positioned we are to leverage this recovery. We also continued to be diligent about cost. We took an additional $4 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to last year. That\u2019s a sustainable improvement and it puts us solidly on target with our projects. But the cost of rentals ex depreciation which is a metric influence by demand, volume increased by $12 million. And some of the demand is seasonal, some of its cyclical and some of it we believe is coming from our end markets opting to rent equipment rather than to purchase it.", "And when you take these external factors into account combining with the impact of our strategy, it helps explain the record time utilization we reported last night. Given these market opportunities, we\u2019ve increased our strategic spend on fleet in the quarter by a $113 million. We also sold $74 million of used equipment at more than four times than margin we got last year. Again, another sign that things are stabilizing. We have a lot of discipline invested in both cost control and fleet management which is why we feel very comfortable reaffirming our free cash flow estimate for the year even with the projected increase in net rental CapEx.", "Bill will go over these numbers and elaborate on our full year outlook after I complete this. Now before I talked about the environment, I want to be very direct with you on the subject of rental rates. I know rates are hot topic right now. I also know that there are some mixed signals in terms of these \u2013 of the metrics being reported by our industry. As you saw last night, our own numbers showed record time utilization for the third quarter but our rates were still down 1.4% compared to last year. So what\u2019s going on here? Well, for one thing, rates in general are lagging utilization in the recovery as expected.", "Second, monthly rates are lagging daily weekly rates because our strategy is focused on large accounts about 71% of our transactions are monthly right now. That\u2019s up about two points sequentially in year-over-year. And the inherent difference in rates is obvious when you break it down in rental term. For example, in our third quarter our monthly rates improved sequentially 1.7% while daily rates were up 3%. That\u2019s almost twice the pace of monthly.", "The third factor is fleet mix. Aerial equipment accounts for roughly half of our fleet and we\u2019ve said before dirt equipment gets rented first on projects followed by aerial. And we expect that aerial rates to be challenging in the short term and to some degree, they mask the environment in earthmoving and general rental rates. Overall, our rates have turned to corner and in the third quarter, rates improved 2% sequentially from the second quarter. And that\u2019s one of the largest sequential improvements we\u2019ve seen. And since we\u2019re focused on achieving a more optimum balance of pricing and time utilization, our target [ph] utilization is also improving up 2.9 percentage point year-over-year in the quarter.", "That\u2019s good. But we planned to do a lot better. Now at this point, given current trends, we expect our rates to be flat or slightly positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And a continued trend upward as we go into the next year in the first quarter of 2011. Now we would normally be cautious by giving that outlook. But I have a lot of confidence in the discipline that we\u2019re creating around rental rates. For example, our price optimization software called POR (ph) is now in place at all of branches except Trench.", "POR is giving us customer centric pricing, which essentially means our sales team now has a better understanding of optimal pricing. They know how far they can negotiate. And more importantly, they know when to walk away. Our price optimization is an example of how we\u2019re continuing to invest in technology again to support our strategy. Another one is our mobile website which we announced last month.", "And when I look at all these initiatives I see our strategy at work, but I also see a marketplace that is ready to move away from the downturn. Now I want to share some information that we\u2019re making available for the first time this morning. It supports what we hear from analyst and what our own employees report back for us in the field. And there are three good reasons to expect that rates will continue to trend upwards. In September, we surveyed over 1,600 of our customers with a wide range of rental spend. And to get their outlook on 2011, it excludes the gulf where the survey is being conducted this month.", "And the results come from contractors out there in the trenches while they live in the reality every day. 43% of those surveyed expect business to increase in 2011, 38% indicated a status quo or uncertain and only 19% think things will continue to go downhill. The greatest uncertainly appears to be in the west, particularly the Southwest. The greatest optimism comes from the customers in our Northeast Canada and Midwest regions. So we\u2019re staying very close to our customers and listening to their input. Now let me tell you what our own branches are seeing out in the field.", "All nine of our regions show year-over-year growth in rental revenues in the third quarter. With the strongest being Northeast Canada, and the weakest being the East and the Southwest. And on a macro level, the picture is equally is encouraging. In the third quarter, our rental revenues were up year-over-year in 33 of our 48 states and all Canadian provinces. A 22 states and provinces now show year-over-year growth for 2010 through September. And our Trench, Power HVAC business had a good third quarter, up 6.8% in revenues and a 7.2% improvement in operating margin.", "And we\u2019re seeing demand from several directions. So one thing, the stimulus money is still in play and we have Trench Safety systems on about a 150 stimulus jobs right now. Both Trench and Power HVAC are servicing more infrastructure projects. A public sectors together with growth in industrial are driving results in this business. I also want to mention the joint venture with AMECO that we announced in the August.", "This is initially focused on oil and gas customers in the gulf region. At this point all the pieces are in place and both partners are moving forward. And we\u2019ll keep you posted as things progress, but I think we\u2019ve made it clear how excited we are to be able to pilot with this industrial venture with AMECO. Even without the joint venture, our industrial business contributed an additional $5 million of revenue in the third quarter versus last year. Industrial rentals are just one example of how we\u2019re training our sales people to look beyond the traditional boundaries into construction industry and pursue any market that fits our strategy for profitable growth.", "As we identify these opportunities we are seeking our large customers where our scale has the most appeal particularly our ability to share fleet across our North American footprint. In the third quarter, national accounts accounted for about 29% of rental revenue, which is an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. And it\u2019s worth noting that the increasing amount of our industrial business is coming from our national accounts. So as we grow our presence in the industrial sector, we\u2019ve been guided by our customer segmentation strategy.", "The concept of staying true to our strategy informs every decision we make as we steer our company into the recovery. It\u2019s not going to be a smooth ride but when we look out at the markets, we see a customer choosing to rent more of equipment they need. So to manage some part of the strong momentum that we\u2019re experiencing as we move into the two slowest quarters and it should help soften the effect of seasonality. We\u2019ve begun the process of putting our plans in place for 2011 and to really we can comment on that we\u2019ll share our thoughts.", "So now on that note, I will now ask Bill to review the results and then after that we\u2019ll take your questions. So over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone. As has become our tradition, I\u2019ll give some more detail on the quarter, revenues, our cost performance, little bit on the fleet, liquidity, update our outlook for 2010 and then touch on as Mike said, touch on 2011.", "On the revenue front, it was a good quarter almost any way you slice it, rental revenue in particular was up 6% year-over-year. That\u2019s the first year-over-year increase we\u2019ve had in a quarter since the first quarter of 2008. So it\u2019s been a long time coming. Within that Mike mentioned the time utilization increase that we saw 71.3% time for the quarter, that\u2019s up 7.1 percentage points year-over-year and I think its legitimate to say that we didn\u2019t get it by shrinking the size of the fleet. Overall the size of the fleet averaged slightly smaller this year compared to last year.", "The time really came out of stronger demand. OEC on rent was up 11% year-over-year. Rates were working against us, so I think that makes that 6% revenue increase in rental revenue even more impressive, as Mike said rates were down 1.4% year-over-year. Although, they were up two percentage points sequentially for the quarter. And when you look within the quarter, in fact if you look over the last couple of quarters, on a sequential basis rates, have been sequentially positive for six consecutive months starting in April, they\u2019ve been up every month on a sequential basis.", "Now Mike highlighted some of the internals going on within rate for example, daily and weekly rates are clearly outperforming our monthly rates overall. And then when you look at equipment type, earthmoving and other general rentals categories are clearly outperforming aerial and forklifts. But overall, the trend is established in the right direction. And we certainly as always will continue to drive for better rate realization just across the board.", "The other area of revenue that I wanted to focus a little bit of time on is used equipment sales. We sold $32 million in proceeds of used equipment during the third quarter. While although it\u2019s down versus last year, you\u2019ll all recall that we were selling at record levels of used equipment sales last year. So there should be no surprise that the proceeds came down. On an OEC basis, we sold $74 million of OEC in the quarter and that was down as well versus $100 million or so that we sold last year. The good news is that we achieved a margin on our used sales this quarter of 31.3%. And as has been in the case for the prior two quarters of this year, the margin story is really heavily driven by the distribution channel.", "We sold 57% of what we sold in the third quarter through retail. And supported by used equipment pricing, the trends in used equipment pricing continued to be positive backed by the Rouse data that we received, but also by our own individual experience in selling into the market. So the used equipment market continues to be robust and we\u2019ll continue to use it very effectively to manage our fleet.", "On the cost side, cost of rentals were actually up year-over-year in the quarter, $237 million, up $12 million compared to last year. And really that cost performance is the tale of two cities. When you look into the fixed cost of our cost of rentals, we continue to lever good to \u2013 to deliver good cost performance on the fixed cost component of our cost structure. So when you look at salaries and benefits, you look at facilities cost, other structural fixed cost components, we continued to deliver reductions in those components. It\u2019s just being outstripped by the variable cost components that are flowing with the increased rental volume. So when you look at repair and maintenance, delivery, fuel costs, those kinds of cost components that really are driven by how many transactions you do, they are up. And they\u2019ve offset the saves that we realized on the fixed cost side.", "That\u2019s prompted us to reevaluate our outlook for cost performance over the remainder of 2010. And we are now saying that we expect cost of rentals ex depreciation to be a save of 15, or excuse me $5 million to $15 million compared to last year. Longer term, we\u2019re still very comfortable that we\u2019ve improved significantly the cost structure of this business and still feel very good about our work against the fixed cost components of our business.", "The story on SG&A is better. SG&A was down $4 million year-over-year. And the benefits are still coming out of the same places that we\u2019ve been talking about. So salaries and benefits, those are really driven by headcount, and the headcount reductions have continued albeit at a somewhat smaller pace than in prior quarters. Professional fees are still a very nice source of save for us as we continued to be disciplined about our spend there.", "The bad debt experienced in the quarter was higher. We actually had year-over-year about $6 million negative in bad debt, and that reflects primarily the larger size of accounts receivable as we\u2019ve driven higher revenue. We also had a slight deterioration in the aging of our portfolio but the real driver was the size of the AR balance causing that $6 million negative year-over-year comparison for SG&A.", "All in all, we feel very good about SG&A and in fact we are reaffirming our target for a full year SG&A reduction of $40 million to $50 million. Obviously, we\u2019ve got $37 million of that in our pocket already year-to-date. So we feel very comfortable that we\u2019ll be able to achieve the target that we gave of $40 million to $50 million. Looking at the profit lines, adjusted EBITDA came in at $216 million for the quarter. And that\u2019s at a 35.7% adjusted EBITDA margin, 460 basis points better than last year and to Mike\u2019s point obviously we\u2019re taking full advantage of the increased operating leverage that we\u2019ve built into the business from lower cost.", "So a great story there. That\u2019s in spite of a decline year-over-year in rental rates, I think is very encouraging. EPS, similar story there. Adjusted EPS of $0.40 for the quarter. And the drivers are the same as the EBITDA drivers that I talked about. It is worth noting that in calculating EPS, we used a tax rate for the quarter of 39.5% and I pointed out simply because in the second quarter, we talked about a 54% tax rate as what we were thinking about going forward. That change in tax rate we can talk about in Q&A if anybody wants to get into it but as we look at the fourth quarter, we think something like the low 40s to mid-40s is the right way to think about the tax rate to apply to the fourth quarter income.", "And we\u2019ll continue to update obviously if anything major changes there. Just a couple of quick words on our fleet management in the quarter. We have continued to drive optimal use of our fleet, one of the ways we talk about that is the amount of fleet that we transfer within our system. And the transfers were strong again in the third quarter, $1.6 billion of fleets transferred during the quarter. It\u2019s about 42% of our fleet overall moving during the quarter. And obviously we talked about how we believe that helps us more effectively utilize the investment that we\u2019ve made in fleet.", "In managing our used equipment sales for the quarter, we continue to execute our strategy of selling the older equipment first. So our used sales for the quarter came in at an age, at average age of 78 months, consistent with where we\u2019ve been over the last couple of years, and again consistent with the strategy. Our net rental CapEx investment for the quarter was $81 million, that comprised of a $113 million of gross capital spend and the $32 million of used sales proceeds that I mentioned previously.", "Year-to-date we spend $287 million of gross CapEx. And that spend has been as we\u2019ve talked about before, it\u2019s been directed towards supporting the growth that we\u2019re seeing with large accounts, supporting the reshaping the mix of our fleet and making sure that we\u2019re making good decisions about the components that we have that need to be addressed and need to provide the maximum rental experience for our customers. Where we\u2019re buying, is in earthmoving equipment, a heavy proportion of the spend there. We\u2019re obviously replacing aerial, when aerial is nearly half of your fleet, you\u2019re certainly going to spend to replace there.", "But we\u2019re also disproportionately spending on other general rentals categories like light towers, compressors supporting in the areas like water trucks, pickup trucks and other important general rental categories. Given our spending in the quarter in what we\u2019ve done year-to-date, we feel very comfortable with spending more to support the environment that we are managing in and so as we look at 2010 we now believe that we\u2019ll spend net rental CapEx in the range of $180 million to $200 million that\u2019s up from the $160 million to $180 million that we had guided to last quarter.", "Free cash flow for the quarter was solid, $37 million in the quarter and that brings us to a $144 million for the year-to-date. And again that\u2019s very well in line with the guidance that we\u2019ve previously given of full year free cash flow in the $200 million to $225 million range. That obviously in spite of the lowered cost saves on cost of rent and in spite of the higher spend on net rental CapEx. So we feel very good about being able to preserve that kind of free cash flow.", "Our liquidity position, ended the quarter strong again. We ended with roughly $860 million of total liquidity and so we feel very comfortable with the position of the capital structure currently and how it supports our business. As it relates to the capital structure, I\u2019ll just touch real briefly on the bond deal that we issued press release around this morning, many of you saw that I\u2019m sure. We are now saying that we expect to issue 10 years of senior subordinated notes and the notion there is to use to proceeds to redeem our 7 \u00be % notes that are maturing in 2013.", "This is consistent with our ongoing strategy of making sure that the maturity within our debt is well managed and pushed out far enough so that we don\u2019t have any undue concerns about refinancing needs in the near terms. We will be in the market today. We expect the issue to go well and we expect that we will price and finalize terms over the next couple of days. Just real quickly on our 2010 outlook, I think I had touched on most of the components of our outlook but just to reaffirm our SG&A guidance for the 2010 full year is still expected to be a reduction of $40 million to $50 million, so no change there.", "Our cost of equipment rentals, we now expect a reduction of between $5 million and $15 million for the full year, that\u2019s down from the $30 million to $50 million that we had previously guided to. Net rental CapEx, we expect to spend between a $180 million and $200 million, that\u2019s up from the previous range of $160 million to $180 million. And then free cash flow, no change there between $200 million and $225 million.", "Real briefly on 2011, as we look down the road we\u2019ve started making some high-level decisions but we are certainly deep into budgeting process as we speak. Still we thought it was appropriate to give you some highlights as we\u2019re thinking about 2011. So on the rate front, Mike said that we expect if trends continue that the fourth quarter of this year will finish out with rates flat to up slightly year-over-year, if we achieve that, then going into 2011 we\u2019ll have nice momentum and in fact if we achieve that fourth quarter performance and then just kept those rates flat throughout 2011, we would experience carryover in 2011 of about two percentage points year-over-year.", "Obviously, we\u2019ll drive from more than that but I just wanted to give that data point that there is a couple of points of carryover in 2011 as we think about it today. On the CapEx front for 2011. We\u2019ve said this in one on ones, but wanted to say it here more specifically. Our gross and net rental CapEx spend next year will be more in 2011 than it is this year. And in fact I think we\u2019d say now that it would be significantly more. Somebody is going to ask me what I mean by significant in Q&A and I\u2019ll tell you that we don\u2019t have that number yet but what we\u2019re thinking for 2011 based on the good momentum that we\u2019ve seen with key relationships from 2010, we\u2019re going to need to spend to support those relationships as well as to continue to position the fleet for where we wanted to be over the long haul.", "That said, we still expect that we will deliver positive free cash flow in 2011. And again somebody is going to ask me well what does positive free cash flow means its somewhere between zero and infinity. So we can talk about that in more detail as we go forward as well. Those are the comments I wanted to make. Maybe I\u2019ll stop there and open it up for Q&A and we can take it from there. So, operator.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS. Your question please.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Hi good morning guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Henry.", "William Plummer", "Henry.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Could you dive a little deeper into the increase you saw in time utilization this quarter. Is there any way to attribute the improvement between the secular shift to rental, the underlying demand improvements in what you\u2019re doing on the fleet management and mix side? And maybe any other bucket I\u2019m missing?", "William Plummer", "I\u2019ll take a first stab at Henry. It\u2019s really hard to decompose it into those kind of buckets. I do think that it\u2019s fair to say that the seasonal pattern was stronger this year. And so that certainly helped. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve argued earlier in the year that this year\u2019s seasonal pattern seemed to be stronger than where it\u2019s been over the last several years, certainly stronger than last year. And so if you think about 7.1 percentage points of year-over-year time utilization improvement, I\u2019d hate to put a number on how much of that is just seasonal, excuse me that year-over-year will have a seasonal component.", "I\u2019d hate to put a number on how much of that is broken out into the other buckets. That said, we\u2019ve got nice growth in our key account relationships year-over-year in the quarter. So clearly a portion of it is just growing those key account relationships. Mike, I\u2019ll let you put a number on how much of it might be to shift to secular, secular shift to rental versus owning. But I\u2019d say that that\u2019s a smaller component of that year-over-year change. It\u2019s just really hard to put numbers on it.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes Henry, its Mike. It is very difficult, I mean what we can say is that when you look at a year-over-year basis, last year it\u2019s safe to say that we really didn\u2019t see any kind of seasonal uptick at all, it was very lackluster I think because of where the economy was and the lack of any kind of visibility and the uncertainty in the financial markets. Seasonality has returned. The one thing I can tell you is that we look at and it\u2019s on a year-over-year basis, our new accounts are up. So that means people are looking at ways to rent. They\u2019re up about 15% year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. So but as Bill mentioned it\u2019s very difficult to quantify the numbers specifically.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, given your increased focus on sharing a fleet, how high do you think you could get time utilization over the course of the cycle when demand picks up?", "William Plummer", "So Henry, we\u2019ve talked about over the course of the year getting time up into the high 70s. As we sit here I think 67% over the course of the entire year would be a very high level of time utilization for this company. Could we do better than that? Yes, we probably could. But as we\u2019re seeing right now operating at these levels of time utilization involves some operational challenges based on how we run the business historically. And so we\u2019re going to have to figure out better ways, new ways and different ways of operating in order to be able to sustain these kinds of time utilization levels at reasonable costs. We\u2019re going through that right now, we\u2019re learning those processes but we as an executive team are convinced that we can operate in the high 60s.", "I think we put 67% as the target in our sort of normalized EBITDA analysis last quarter and I think that\u2019s a good indication of where we think we can drive it to on a sustainable basis.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "And one final one if I could. How should we think about the cadence of the repricing by customer type, across your book of business?", "William Plummer", "I\u2019m sorry, ask that question again.", "Michael Kneeland", "We\u2019re checking up.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Sorry, how should we think about the cadence of repricing by customer type across your book of business. Does industrial take longer to get repriced than the contractor fleet, etcetera?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, Henry its Mike. The way in which we setup our contracts are, there is a kind of a range in which we work within. It is the range would be from the global perspective not to exceed pricing. So you have a bandwidth in which you can work within the current markets. In other areas, we have the regional differences because of cost structures and where they\u2019re located.", "I think each one is priced accordingly. Typically, these are one year to three year in duration. So we do have flexibility within the contract itself.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Nice quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Manish.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Hi Mike, congratulations and good morning to everyone. Couple of quick questions, Bill on CapEx. When you said significantly higher CapEx, I\u2019m not asking for the amount, but I\u2019m just asking for is it going to be more concentrated in earthmoving or aerials?", "William Plummer", "Yes, we haven\u2019t definitively laid out that level of detail in the CapEx spend for 2011, but I do think it\u2019s fair to say that I would be shocked if we don\u2019t end up spending sort of relative to the breakdown of our fleet, the mix of our fleet today. I\u2019d be shocked if we didn\u2019t spend more than the current earthmoving share of our fleet on earthmoving, less than the current share of aerial on aerial, more than the current share on trench and other general rental categories on those categories. And probably not dramatically different on forklifts.", "So I know that\u2019s high level and just directional but we want to continue that trend, right? We want to continue to focus on reshaping the fleet away from aerial toward earthmoving and then supporting the growth that we\u2019re seeing in general rental categories especially driven by industrial relationships as well growth in Trench and Power and HVAC. So that\u2019s where our spend is going to end up.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Okay, thank you. Michael, two questions for you on AMECO JV. Do you have a revenue or EBITDA or industrial penetration type targets that we should benchmark against?", "Michael Kneeland", "It\u2019s too early, I the both \u2013 AMECO and ourselves have gotten together and we\u2019re putting a plan together. As Bill mentioned we\u2019re going through our planning. They are as well. As things start to develop, we will be open to share those with you. It\u2019s too early to tell at this time, Manish.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Okay. And then just on the bigger picture, the industry obviously with the ABI Index indicates at least hopefully initial step in the recovery process. The question really is on how impactful will the regionals be in the future? Is that a model that can exist, is it sustainable or do you think that they might just need to consolidate?", "Michael Kneeland", "It\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s one I often get and its somewhat complicated to answer it back, but let me give you a try. I think yes there is always going to be an area for regionals. I do think that regionals have been severely punished and pressured in this downturn. The question is accessibility to the capital markets and whether they can, like anyone else be able to sustain the capital structure and maintain their growth and their profitability to exist. So I do think that they will continue, there will be pockets, but I do think that they will always be pressured.", "It\u2019s kind of one of those things where you\u2019re not small enough, and you\u2019re not big enough on the same coin. I will tell you that historically there has been a lot of growth for regionals. And I do believe that there will be further consolidation in our industry. Our industry is still immature and it\u2019s still very fragmented. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise to me to see a continuation of consolidation.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Okay. And then just lastly for Bill. Bill, you mentioned the gross margin on the used equipment, you said that the mix helped with the higher margins but compared to some of the peers in the industry, your margins have been running quite strong and I guess the one question I have is I just want to make sure that the book basis of used equipment sold, was it ever impaired?", "William Plummer", "There might \u2013 in the current quarter there might have been some, I can\u2019t remember whether we had any impairment impacts only what we sold in the current quarter. Chris is shaking his head, no. Yes, I\u2019m just trying to remember the timing of when we sold the Mexico assets which we may have impaired previously but that was in second quarter of was it third quarter? But regardless even if it was third quarter, it would be a small portion of overall, the overall sales.", "So there is nothing unusual going on in the book basis of what we\u2019re selling even in the third quarter or fourth across the entirety of this year. It answers your question.", "Manish Somaiya \u2013 Citi", "Yes, I just wanted to make sure. Thank you again and best of luck.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hey good morning guys. Going back to the CapEx discussion, I mean is that number that you\u2019re kind of thinking about, is that designed to bring the age of the fleet down, I mean you\u2019ve talked about in the past you know kind of a maintenance CapEx level. Should we think about plus or minus that maintenance levels, what you\u2019re thinking?", "William Plummer", "Seth, it\u2019s not specifically \u2013 the thought process is not specifically that we need to bring the age of the fleet down. Our view is that we can operate very comfortably at or above where we think we\u2019ll end the year on fleet age. So that\u2019s not the driving consideration for our thoughts about how much CapEx to spend next year. It\u2019s a factor but it\u2019s not the driving factor. We\u2019re really more focused on what do we need to spend to support the relationships that we\u2019ve deemed strategically to be the most important. And then how do we remix the fleet and then how do we make sure that we\u2019re addressing the replacement of the units across our portfolio that we think could interfere with the customer\u2019s rental experience.", "Those are the prime thoughts that will lead us to a CapEx number. It\u2019s just become very so far to our planning process that that number is going to be significantly higher than it is this year. I don\u2019t know that I can say much more than that at this point, I wish I could.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Let me ask you in different way, and do you expect the age of the fleet to come down next year?", "William Plummer", "Haven\u2019t definitely decided. What I can promise you is that we will make sure that wherever the age of the fleet goes next year that it\u2019s not getting in the way of our ability to generate revenue. If we operated next year in the low 50s, I don\u2019t think that would be a problem. Obviously that\u2019s higher in fleet age than where we are today and so that would suggest that we could spend less than sort of the level that we\u2019ve talked about needing to keep the age constant.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.", "William Plummer", "I wish there was more definitive answer that we can give you right now but we\u2019re still thinking a lot of these issues through.", "Michael Kneeland", "And Seth we\u2019re going through our plan process, this is Michael, going through our plan process. But the way in which we look at the world is based on demand and returns and our customers, those are going to be some of the driving forces that we\u2019ll be looking at very closely as Bill mentioned, I think we\u2019ve proven, the industry will prove that time utilization can go back up and age is not the deciding factor on that, it\u2019s how well you maintain it.", "It to us it\u2019s about discipline and demand in where we\u2019re going to put our money to get our returns.", "William Plummer", "And just don\u2019t lose track of the fact that we did say free cash flow positive next year. So that\u2019s a constrain, and a constrain quite honestly that we\u2019ll flex based on how active the market is next year. If we get better rate performance then sort of we\u2019re thinking about right now. If we get that better volume demand than we\u2019re thinking about right now, than we may flex the amount of spend up. If we don\u2019t get it, we may flex the amount of spend down. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to get through this planning process to have a better sense from our regions of where we think we\u2019re going to end up on the cash from upside and then we\u2019ll nail a CapEx number coming out of that.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right, and do you think that used equipment sales will be about flat next year?", "William Plummer", "I think they\u2019ll go up as well. Again don\u2019t have a definitive view of how much they\u2019ll go up but if we\u2019re going to spend more we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re taking out as part of that greater spend, taking out the units that needs to be taken out and we won\u2019t be shy about doing that. So I\u2019d say used sales will go up next year. Will it go up proportionately? Yet to be decided.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then just a follow-up question on the fourth quarter pricing commentary. Is that \u2013 so you\u2019re talking about pricing up year-over-year, can you give us what that would equate to on a sequential basis?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sequential basis I think it\u2019s like 0.75%.", "William Plummer", "So I think for the quarter if we got sort of what we\u2019re thinking about for the quarter, it\u2019d be a little less than that. It\u2019ll be sequentially the quarter would be flat to up just a little bit.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Flat, so from 3Q to 4Q flat up a little bit?", "William Plummer", "Exactly.", "William Plummer", "Which the seasonal pattern of our industry is we get into November and things start coming off rents. So that tends to put a little bit of downward pressure on pricing late in the year and early in the year for the winter months as well. So that\u2019s not a shock that we might be around flat in the fourth quarter maybe up just a touch.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right, so that was the spirit of my question was how much of \u2013 how good is your visibility there, I mean is that being driven by longer-term contracts that you\u2019ve singed recently that you can definitely say that you have that in the bag or do you think that the markets just getting better?", "William Plummer", "We certainly have some longer-term relationships that we\u2019ve signed this year that gives us some more visibility. I would say though its mainly just reasoning from where we\u2019re standing right now in terms of the amount of equipment that\u2019s on rent. We\u2019re at a high level of OEC on rent and on time utilization of our fleet as you can tell. Fourth quarter has started out with good momentum coming in from the third quarter. So we\u2019re starting from a pretty high level of overall demand and we think that that will it\u2019ll fall off seasonally but it will fall off less severely than it has over the last couple of years and the momentum on rates has been positive enough so that the seasonal impact will be as negative as maybe it is usually.", "So that\u2019s the reasoning that we apply to say that we could get flat year-over-year and flattish kind of sequentially.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Was pricing up in September year-over-year?", "William Plummer", "We haven\u2019t addressed that explicitly, I guess in the past we\u2019ve given the month year-over-year. So yes, in for penny, in for a pound. September was not up year-over-year for the month, it was down.", "Michael Kneeland", "Zero point five.", "William Plummer", "Yes, 0.5%.", "Michael Kneeland", "Zero point five. Yes, 0.5.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thanks very much guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Good morning guys. Just following up on that last question. Bill, you\u2019ve breached in the past, could you give us a little color on the months by months pricing sequentially through the third quarter please?", "William Plummer", "Mike, you want to do it?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, I\u2019ll do it. In the month of July, it was down negative 2.3, August was down to negative 1.4 and as I just mentioned September was down 0.5. Those are year-over-year numbers.", "William Plummer", "Those are year-over-years by month and I guess I would only add that the down in July reflected what was a very strong comparison month last year. The July comp was through the roof last year. And so I think that was the key driver for that down to change for that month. We\u2019ve reestablished the trend that we expected here in August and especially in September and what we\u2019re seeing so far in November gives us confidence in the statement we\u2019ve made about rates.", "William Plummer", "And if I want to give you the sequential its 0.8 for July, 0.7 for August and 1.4 for September.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great, thanks a lot guys. And then on just could you speak to pricing overall out in the industry. What are you seeing from the national players, the regional players, the level of discipline. Where is it now that we\u2019re into the fourth quarter to the extent you can comment on that? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well I think that that everyone is being good stewards of the industry and doing their best to get rates up. That\u2019s a general comment I\u2019m getting across all of my regions and my branches as I go on visits. Is there pockets? Yes, there is always going to be pockets. Is there going to be one where we see competitive pricing. I think the area that we see the most competitive pricing is in aerial. In aerial, the aerial players are scattered across North America and you can take that from small to medium. But I think overall the industry is waking up and responding to need to improve on prices.", "And by the way the industry overall is healing as I mentioned before its going out into the second quarter, used prices improving continue. We are seeing time utilization improve and my sense is that will be across the industry as a whole and as a result of that pricing will follow.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks. One more if I could, Bill probably more targeted towards you, with positive momentum on SG&A relative to your guidance and obviously with the strong revenue on cost of service a little bit with the variable in the different direction. For us building out our models in \u2018011 and into the out years, where should we anticipate grabbing the majority of the leverage of those two line items and just a little bit more on how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thanks.", "William Plummer", "So I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re strictly focused on the selling and G&A components of SG&A. Is that your question?", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "No, no cost of services, yes cost of rental versus SG&A and yes with a little bit of itemization of sales versus G&A if you could.", "William Plummer", "Yes, so again I\u2019ll plead the planning process to a some extent but I would \u2013 if you\u2019d ask me that question a couple of months ago I might have had a slightly different answer on the cost of rent components that I have today, given the momentum we\u2019re seeing on volume demand and the variable cost drivers there, I\u2019m probably less optimistic about a dramatic reduction in cost of rent next year. I know that we\u2019ve got some initiatives that will help us address some of the fixed cost components I just think that the variable cost components could be a pretty strong headwind if the kind of volume demand that we\u2019re seeing continues into next year.", "So that one\u2019s is a harder one to say that we\u2019ll have absolute dollar saves year-over-year next year, or how much those dollar saves might be. SG&A I think I\u2019m more optimistic that while we should have selling cost increase next year that there is some other initiatives on the G&A cost components that we could use to offset those. I\u2019m not ready to put a number on the page just yet. I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to target further SG&A reductions next year. But I\u2019d want to get through my planning process before I can say that with any conviction.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Sure enough and thanks for that color.", "William Plummer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wells from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research Group", "Hi everyone.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, how are you?", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research Group", "Doing well. I guess first off, I appreciate these colors regarding the difference between the daily and the monthly rates. Just to get a sense of the elasticity. Are you finding that when you have a monthly rate that comes off, if a customer is renewing, are you being able to push that pricing up or you finding some push back from customers as you to try to move the right needle?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, this is Mike. The way in which we measure that would be sequence one which would be first sequence as they come out. And to your point we\u2019re seeing the monthly rates improve as they come off rent and they go back out on rent. And that\u2019s on a global site of all of our assets collectively. So it\u2019s a fair comment.", "William Plummer", "So maybe if I can say exactly what you said, in maybe a few different words, sequence one is the first billing cycle of a new rental. So that gives you an indication of the new rate that\u2019s being established with that new rental. When you just look at those transactions the monthly rate is up as Mike said. When you look at the monthly revenue components that are from the mix of new transactions plus outstanding transactions that billed on a monthly cycle, the monthly rate is not as attractive.", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research Group", "That\u2019s helpful though. And then just looking at the location count in the quarter, continuing to find locations to close as you look at the store count going into next year, what are your thoughts on that and is there room for additional cost takeout just from a consolidation of locations?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Michael. As we\u2019ve said that we\u2019re always looking at our optimizing our footprint and we will continue to look at where we can optimize overall. As we said before we continued to look at this and make sure that and the idea is that not lose any market share or to capture the revenue once we leave, a lot of these are consolidations. And some would take longer to sink them through than others. But we\u2019re going to continue to just process.", "Going back to even what one of the other comments on cost overall. This is a dedicated team that\u2019s focused on cost reductions. We\u2019re not going to let off just because we\u2019ve got a good quarters behind us. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on trying to drive efficiencies. So it is still an area that we were focused on. I would also point out that we also had some cold starts as well in our branch count and we\u2019re focusing on growing the areas of profitable growth. So we\u2019re going to do both going forward.", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research Group", "That\u2019s helpful as well. And then I guess an additional question regarding that the cost savings that you\u2019ve seen just looking at I guess second quarter to third quarter, you saw almost 350 basis point of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Is there anything from like a onetime perspective that would have been a benefit in the quarter or is that just more a function of the cost takeout being leveraged as you get additional rental rate, excuse me additional rental revenues through the door.", "William Plummer", "There is nothing that would have been a significant onetime benefit, no individual action, I might add that I called out the $6 million year-over-year change in bad debt, so on a year-over-year basis that hurts us sequentially it\u2019s probably not a dramatic change in bad debt. So I\u2019m not thinking of anything on a second quarter to third quarter comparison basis that was unique or significant in that improvement in margin.", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research Group", "Great, thank you so much.", "William Plummer", "Okay.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good afternoon.", "William Plummer", "Hi.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So the first question is the bond offering that you guys have in the market today, would you consider upsizing that to also take out your 7% notes or do you prefer to have two sub tranches in your cash structure?", "William Plummer", "Phil, its Bill. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate the strategy as we see how the demand develops. The notion going in was as we said 500 to take out the 7 \u00be. If its blow out demand, we\u2019ll give full consideration to upsizing and acting on the sevens. That would be sort of a logical thought process if we had more money. So go out and tell your folks to buy and we\u2019ll see if we can face that question.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "It sounds good. And then on the one and seven-eighths, I saw you had $93 million put-back to you. The $22 million that remained outstanding. Are they still putable to you or did that expired?", "William Plummer", "It was one time put at this time, there is another put in three years that they have available to them.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, last question and probably more philosophical. Clearly some of the regional players out there are I guess in more difficulty that you guys are at this point in the cycle. What is the thought process in terms of do you prefer greenfield starts or do you prefer to make a larger acquisition?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. The reality with this is as I mentioned we have five cold starts that we put out there. So we\u2019re not afraid to do both, but to be clear it has to be strategic, it has to fit with our strategic vision of where we want to take this company that we\u2019ve articulated to everybody. But we\u2019d always be interested in looking and seeing if they do fit strategically, but we\u2019ll take it as it goes.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay so there is nothing \u2013 you\u2019re not actively looking out there at acquisitions. Its more \u2013 if something comes along you\u2019ll take a look at it?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, we\u2019re always, we\u2019re always scouring to see what opportunities exist out there. We\u2019re not going to be sitting idle. It\u2019s a matter of making sure that if we can find something we\u2019re interested in it. And that\u2019s what my team does and we\u2019ll continue to focus.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emily Shanks from Barclays Capital. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Emily.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi how are you guys?", "Michael Kneeland", "Good.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just two quick ones for you, the first one is more housekeeping. On the AR securitization if I have it right, it actually matures I think a year from today. When will you start looking at renewing that? Is that within the year or just much closer to the actual maturity?", "William Plummer", "Yes, Emily we will look at it on an ongoing basis. We haven\u2019t set a definitive time in which we want to renew it. And I guess I\u2019m a little bit relaxed about it just because those facilities have been so readily available even through the turmoil last year, they were readily available. Our lenders were coming in saying hey we want more money basically.", "So we\u2019ll look at it on an ongoing basis and I think we\u2019ll pull the trigger as we line up set of banks and a set of conditions that we think look favorable. So stay tuned.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. And then my last and final one is just more of a bigger picture one, clearly before the consumer driven recession you guys had forged leveraged down quite nicely. What is your larger picture view on what the appropriate leverage target is for URI and I know obviously you will have growth in there, but how are you thinking about leverage over the next couple of years?", "William Plummer", "Yes, so I think what we\u2019ve talked about internally and I\u2019ve probably have said it externally as well is that, there is two ways to approach that, one is to flip the question around and say how do I feel about the level of leverage that I\u2019m at today or that I got to last year in the most severe downturn that we\u2019ve seen a long time. And the answer was we felt comfortable with the level of depth that we carried even in the depths of last year.", "And so you can kind of back into what debt-to-EBITDA ration in that environment was and infer that we would be comfortable there. Let\u2019s say that we got up to something in the 4.5 to 5 times that the EBITDA range at the depths of last year on a trailing 12 basis. That probably defines the upper side of that leverage measure that we\u2019d look at. I\u2019d peg a number I\u2019d just 4.5 if we had a choice of actively managing it on high side.", "On the low side, we\u2019ve thought about the philosophy of the capitalization of this company quite a lot actually over the last year and a half. And we feel comfortable operating at levels of leverage that imply being a high-yield issuer. At the low end of the range 3.5 times debt-to-EBITDA is something that we think is probably a good place to look for the minimum of leverage. You go much beyond that and you start to lose some of the cost of capital benefits that we see from being a highly levered company. So that\u2019s the range that I talk about generally, 3.5 to 4.5. And I\u2019d say we\u2019ll operate that way unless there is something really extreme one way or the other.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And just as a follow-up, I really appreciate that color Bill, as you look at, I mean you\u2019re obviously throwing up some pretty nice cash this year and as you indicated you\u2019re expecting free cash flow positive next year, your leverage could naturally work down below that 3.5 times if you think about that priority for free cash. What are you targeting?", "William Plummer", "Well on the surface, we\u2019ll certainly continue to drive down debt until we get to the low end of that range. We\u2019re not going to be religions about 3.5, I mean if sort of the natural momentum of our business making the decisions, the operating decisions that we want to make takes us to slightly lower number than that, okay fine, we can do that for a while.", "So I don\u2019t know that we would go out of our way at the point we reached 3.5 to say oh my goodness, now I\u2019ve got to do something differently. But at the same time we do think that we\u2019ve got operating objectives and some of those we might address more aggressively if we are getting towards the lower end of the range. For example, spending a little bit more on rental CapEx if it makes sense from an investment perspective. So we\u2019ll balance all of those things as we go forward but it\u2019d be a high class problem to have to figure out how to manage or leverage ratio that\u2019s too low.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "William Plummer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question and answer session in today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to turn the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you operator. And I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Please feel free to join us any time or call us up here in Greenwich. And if you would like to go see one of our facilities, please get a hold of Fred Bratman. And if you go to our website you can download the investor presentation which has updates from last night.

Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments by presenters and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release. For a complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.ur.com. ", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectation. You should also note that today's call will include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Plummer, and other members of our senior management team. ", "In some ways, this won't be a typical year-end discussion. We just reported our results for a period that may be the most significant in the last three years. Our performance in the quarter was pivotable (sic) [pivotal] to our company. It allowed us to close out the year from a position of strength and carry that momentum into 2011.", "On the construction cycle, it's showing signs of turning, although the commercial sector is still very weak. But that's okay. We have our arms around that challenge, and as you'll hear, we're bullish about our ability to capitalize on any level of recovery.", "I'll start with a look at some of the key metrics for the fourth quarter, and then I want to talk about our goals as a company and the progress we expect to make towards those goals. And then after that, Bill will cover our outlook and results in detail, and then we'll take your questions.", "So first the numbers. It was a good quarter for us. We were able to take a non-residential construction environment that was negative year-over-year by about 8% and leverage it into a performance that was not only positive, but in some cases, dramatically so. Our rental revenue was up 10.4% in the quarter, including a 14.3% increase in same-store rental revenue. And in addition, we had record time utilization of 69.3%, and that's important because that was the third consecutive quarter of record utilization.", "And perhaps the most telling, our rental rates were up 1.2% for the quarter, year-over-year. In fact, we turned a corner on rates a little earlier and more strongly than we anticipated. That took months of hard work and discipline to make that happen. And let me tell you, it feels great. But we still have a long way to go. ", "Now I'll talk more about rates in a minute, but first I want to summarize our earnings for the fourth quarter. As you know, we have some put and takes in the quarter. And on an adjusted basis, we reported positive EPS of $0.16 per share compared to a loss of $0.21 in 2009. On a GAAP basis, we lost $0.29 per share. And our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $181 million with an adjusted margin of 30.3%, both significantly higher than in the fourth quarter last year. ", "Now all these numbers include the negative impact of an $18 million fourth quarter charge related to our insurance reserves. This is a non-cash charge related to settlements of claims, activities that date back several years.", "Overall, we did a good job on costs in the quarter. We took another $4 million of SG&A expense out of the business compared to 2009. And our full-range SG&A savings of $41 million was in our target range.", "Cost of rentals x depreciation, which is a metric influenced by demand, increased by $14 million for the year. And this expense would actually be down year-over-year by $4 million without the self-insurance charge. Now Bill will talk more about that in a minute.", "Another area of operations we get asked a lot about is our branch network. And we're continuing to optimize our footprint to reflect a more traditional business pattern. In the fourth quarter we consolidated 22 branches, which is almost half the closings in the full year. That's not a reflection on the quarter. It has a lot to do with analyzing our network over time to optimize our footprint in markets where we can maintain the same level of customer service with fewer locations. And we didn't exit any major markets. And we invested in opening four whole starts, including a new Trench Power HVAC location. Specialty rentals is a strategic area of growth for us, and we plan to open more of these branches in the coming months.", "We also expect to close fewer branches going forward. And as a result, the net change in our branch count in 2011 should be more moderate than it was in 2010. So to recap in the fourth quarter, we had higher revenues in our core Rental business, a more efficient cost structure in our corporate and branch operations, better utilization of our fleet at better rates and more flow-through to EBITDA. And we're clearly focused on our strategic priorities, and I would put rental rates on the top of that list.", "I've often made the point that there's a sequence to construction cycle. It starts with the recovery of used equipment prices, followed by utilization and then rates. It's also true that monthly rates lag daily and weekly rates in the recovery. As I mentioned before, monthly rates are the basis for about 70% of our rental revenue for strategic reasons. The fourth quarter was a turning point for us. We were able to push through with the monthly lag and go positive on general rental and dirt-equipment rates year-over-year. The demand for aerial equipment remained weak, and our monthly rates reflected that. But we were able to go positive on aerial rates for our weekly and daily terms.", "The credit for these accomplishments goes to the field team that is incredibly focused on rate improvement. They're doing this with the help of COR [ph], our state-of-the-art price optimization technology. And our sales force is using this intelligence to help balance rates and utilization. In fact, if you recall, I gave you the prediction on the last call that our rates would be flat to slightly positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And we're happy to outperform it.", "If there's a common theme to our common state, it's a single word: Outperform. I know it's a bold word in this environment, but one I'm very comfortable with. If you recall three years ago, we set a strategy for long-term profitability. And since then, we've made a lot of progress in transforming this company. This includes staying true to our go-to-market strategy, which is to define United Rentals according to our core business of equipment rental; to leverage our size by serving large construction and industrial accounts through a single point of contact; to serve our customers through Operation United to achieve customer service leadership in our industry; and to continuously improve our cost structure and fleet management.", "In 2010, we saw tangible results of that effort. We showed that we can outperform the construction environment by driving an increase in rental rates and revenues in the last half of the year, and we realized the highest time utilization in the history of our company.", "We also outperformed our outlook on rates in the fourth quarter. And although rates were down about 2% for the full year, we're confident it's better than the industry average. Now I live and breathe these numbers every day in 2010, and our performance tells me that we can leverage this recovery to the same effect or better in 2011.", "There's plenty of evidence that the recovery, while modest, is still gaining traction. We saw a definite improvement in demand in the second half of 2010. And a number of external sources are predicting an increase in project starts in 2011, including McGraw-Hill Construction and the Architectural Billings Index. In December, the ABI score was 54.2, the highest it's been since November of 2007. ", "Within our operations, all nine regions had year-over-year growth of rental revenue in the fourth quarter, and we had 36 states and all 10 Canadian provinces. Now two of those states, the ones that have been chronically very weak, California, which was up 4% in the quarter; and Florida, which was up 5%. So we're encouraged by the change in customer demand.", "Our strategy has been to stay in front of our key customer segments across North America throughout the downturn, earning their confidence for exactly this point in the cycle. And now we're starting to see the payoff, particularly in terms of progress we're making with our customer segmentation strategy. Our National Accounts program and rental revenue was up 15% for the year and 20% for the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of higher demand and our efforts to earn a greater share of wallet.", "We will continue to shift towards larger accounts where we have a competitive advantage. These accounts tend to rent more equipment for longer periods of time, pay invoices more quickly and return equipment with less damage than the average customer. And when managed properly through a single point of contact, larger customers equate to profitable growth. Now in addition, we believe our end markets are opting to rent more equipment rather than purchase it. Recessions always drive some degree of rental penetration, and we strive to be the first in line for any new prospects. For example, in our East Region alone, we signed 1,300 new accounts in the fourth quarter. ", "I just described a number of different opportunities, and the outlook we announced last night shows that we're prepared to make the most of them. We believe that we can achieve a rate increase of at least 5% year-over-year. And if it turns out we can do better, believe me, we won't stop there.", "We're going to spend between $425 million to $475 million of net rental CapEx or about $625 million of gross. And we think we can drive another point or so of time, even after posting a record year. And after all that, we expect to achieve positive free cash flow. Now earlier, I said that we're very committed to outperform at every opportunity. And in the depths of recession, it has a lot to do with positioning. But this year, it's about profitable growth. ", "Now given the way that we're firing on all cylinders, we expect to continue to outperform our end markets. You can see it in our rate performance, our time utilization, our focus on cost, our customer mix, our fleet management, but most of all our employees. It's evident by the way they pulled together to Operation United and keep raising the bar on service with tools like our customer-focused scorecard. The scorecard has already become a way of life. In fact, virtually in every area of the business, our progress can be traced to the support of our employees.", "Now we just received the results from our most recent employee engagement survey, and our scores were up significantly from 2008. In fact, they exceeded the norm for high-performance companies in a number of areas. It's important to our strategy because there's a correlation between employee engagement and customer service and service to profitability.", "Two weeks ago, we brought our field managers together for our annual meeting in Saint Louis. It's a chance to share our objectives for the coming year and to get everybody on the same page with our priorities. There was a clear energy in those meeting rooms. But more than that, there was a sense of commitment. Our people believe that we're going in the right direction. They see firsthand how we're transforming this company in ways that are meaningful to our customers. And they understand how that translates into revenue and profits.", "The sum of what we achieve in 2011 will be dictated by the pace of the recovery. But it's more about discipline, our sense of purpose and our excitement about this opportunity to forge ahead. So on that note, I'll ask Bill to review our results in detail, and then we'll go to your questions. So over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As Mike said, I'll go further into the fourth quarter results. But before going into the fourth quarter, let me recap the 2010 performance against the objectives that we've been updating for you.", "In looking at our SG&A objective, we laid out a $40 million to $50 million save in SG&A costs for the full year in 2010. We achieved the $41 million that Mike mentioned. So toward the bottom of the range, but we achieved the range. As we have seen in a number of the prior quarters, the reductions came about through almost every line of SG&A, but particularly through salaries and benefit costs associated with headcount reductions, through professional fee reductions as we focus our spend there, through T&E [travel and entertainment] reductions and, again, through almost every line of G&A. Importantly, the reductions that we achieved over the full year offset an increase in selling and commission costs associated with higher revenues. So we feel very good about the SG&A performance for 2010.", "Cost of rentals x depreciation, we targeted for a reduction of $5 million to $15 million in 2010, and we finished the year with a $14 million increase. As Mike pointed out, that increase included the impact of the $18 million self-insurance charge that we booked in the fourth quarter. Take that out, and we would have actually had a $4 million reduction very close to the bottom end of the range that we had guided to. Our overall sense is that the cost of rental performance was good in 2010, and that certainly is a strong statement to make, given that we had a very nice rebound in transaction volume and the variable costs associated with that represented a headwind that we did a nice job of overcoming, again, excluding the self-insurance charge. On the self-insurance charge, I'll give just a high-level touch on that in just a minute.", "Free cash flow and net rental CapEx. The guidance was for free cash flow of $200 million to $225 million increase through the year. We delivered $227 million. For net rental CapEx within that, we guided to $180 million to $200 million of net rental CapEx investment. We achieved $202 million, slightly over the top of the range there. So once again, we were able to invest in the business the way we thought appropriate and still deliver very nicely free cash flow performance for the year.", "That's what I want to say about the 2010 outlook. Let me go to the fourth quarter performance details and just hit the highlights there. As Mike said, in the fourth quarter, our rental revenue was up 10% year-over-year. And very clearly, that was driven by a nice rate performance with year-over-year rates up 1.2% for the quarter. If you look sequentially, fourth quarter compared to third quarter, we had a sequential rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2.3%.", "Now on a year-over-year basis, that 1.2% increase is the first time we had a year-over-year quarterly increase in rental rate since the first quarter of 2007. So we feel good about the quarterly performance, and it gave us nice momentum coming into 2011. In fact, we had previously said back in the third quarter call that we expected if rates ended the year the way we expected, we would have had about a 2% carryover into 2011. Our view now is that, that carryover benefit will be about 2\u00bd% in 2011.", "If you look just briefly at the equipment types and the rate performance there in a little bit more detail, the cycle that Mike mentioned earlier is playing out. Earthmoving equipment and general rental categories were the ones that had the best rate performance in 2010, and aerial and forklifts lag somewhat. On the volume and time-utilization front, again, a nice performance in the year and in the quarter. For the quarter, OEC on rent was up 13% in the quarter, while the overall fleet size was only up about 1% versus the prior year. So put those two together and they translate into the time utilization you saw for the quarter. 69.3% time utilization in the fourth quarter, and that's up 7\u00bd percentage points versus the prior year. I don't know about you guys, but that's remarkable to me that we're up. We're 69% utilization in the fourth quarter with the holiday season baked in there and with a very challenging weather environment in some areas of the country during the month of December.", "If you look at time utilization just broadly, the fourth quarter was not only a record fourth quarter in time utilization for us as a company but it was the second highest time utilization quarter ever for the company, following only the third quarter of 2010. So all in all, a very nice performance in the quarter. Just briefly, for the full year, time utilization was at 65.6%. That was up 4.9 percentage points compared to '09. And again, as Mike said, that was another record year for the company.", "Turning now to used equipment. Revenues and margin performance, it was a good quarter for us on the used equipment side. We realized $40 million of proceeds in used equipment sales in the fourth quarter. That on $78 million of OEC sold in the quarter. And most significantly, the margin for those sales came in at 27.5%, and that's up from 10.8% the prior year. So nice margin performance and good volume of sales activity in the quarter. The important driver of that margin improvement was the mix of the channels that we used during the quarter. Retail was very nicely represented, with retail representing 63% of our sales overall in the fourth quarter. That up from 44% retail in the prior year.", "Auction. The share of auction sales was about constant, 30% versus 29%. But the auction results were nicely impacted by the fact that overall pricing in the market has improved over the last year.", "Moving on to cost of rent x depreciation. We, as I touched on earlier, saw fourth quarter cost of rent up slightly versus the prior year. But focusing on the full year, we were up about $14 million. And as I did say, that includes the impact of the self-insurance reserve adjustment. Maybe I'll just take a brief moment here to address that topic briefly. As with most companies, we retain a level of self-insurance in our liability programs. So workers comp, auto liability, general liability, our approach is to retain the first portion of loss to make for a reasonable insurance coverage for the higher levels of loss that we could experience.", "In 2010, the $18 million represented a number of claims that were adversely developing against us in the year 2010. We had several large settlements during the course of the year that are unusual relative to where we've been over the history of the company, and that was a significant driver. Roughly half of that $18 million was associated with unusual adverse claim development. But the other half was associated with our actuary\u2019s view of what we needed to carry as reserve for future adverse development. That component of the reserve called IBNR, incurred but not reported, was about half of the $18 million as well. And within that component, we had a change in methodology by our actuary that contributed roughly $6 million of the $9.5 million associated with IBNR. ", "Neither of those events, either the adverse claim development or the IBNR impact from the actuary, we view as ongoing. And so our view is that the $18 million is not part of our run rate cost, going forward. And we can talk more about this in Q&A if there are questions, but our view is that we don't expect to have this as a matter of routine going forward.", "Moving on to cost performance. I already talked a little bit about SG&A for the quarter and the year, so I won't spend much time there other than to say that we continue to look at opportunities to drive more SG&A savings wherever possible. The challenge, obviously, will be the S part of SG&A in 2011, given that we're expecting revenue growth across the course of the year.", "Dropping down to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $181 million, and that's at a margin of 30.3%. And that margin represented a 350 basis point improvement over the prior year. Obviously, the drivers we've already touched on were the key components. So strong rate performance, very nice utilization performance and good cost controls were the key drivers of that improvement year-over-year. ", "I will point out that, that 350 basis point improvement does include the impact of the self-insurance reserve. If you took that out, the improvement would be more like 660 basis points over the prior year. So very significant margin expansion there.", "And just briefly on the full year, adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 30.9%. That was a 430 basis point improvement over 2009. And here, again, if you took out the self-insurance reserve adjustment, that would be an improvement of more like 510 basis points. So again, nice improvement in margins over the course of the full year.", "Dropping to EPS. On an adjusted EPS basis, we reported $0.16 for the quarter and $0.33 for the full year. And again, the drivers were very similar to the drivers for EBITDA performance in rate and utilization and cost performance. And again, it includes the impact of the self-insurance reserve. ", "I'll also point out that EPS, the impact there of a tax discrete item that we recognized in the quarter, about $6.5 million was included as a tax benefit in the quarter, representing an adjustment for an alternative minimum tax credit that we recognized in the quarter from a prior period. So that favorable impact certainly boosted EPS, but the impact of self-insurance reserve worked against this. If you made the adjustment for those two items, take out the self-insurance reserve charge and take out the impact of that tax benefit, on an adjusted basis, our EPS would be something like $0.23 per share using the 60.6 million shares that we based all of our other calculations on. So all in all, we feel very good about the EPS performance for the quarter. And again, that gives us good momentum going into 2011.", "I already touched on cash flow for the year. For the quarter, free cash flow came in at $83 million that's up nicely against $45 million the prior year. And again, we're continuing to look at free cash flow generation as an important part of how we think about the business going forward. In terms of liquidity at the end of the year, we ended the year with $830 million roughly of overall liquidity that includes availability under the ABL as well as cash in the bank.", "2011. Just a couple of the high-level outlook items for 2011. We do expect the end market to grow, the end market being the rental market. We're seeing something in that 5% to 10% range. And as Mike said in his comments, we expect that our rental revenue performance will outperform the market overall. Combination of good rate performance, nice time utilization and we'll grow the fleet sum this year.", "As you saw in the press release and as Mike said, we expect rates to be up at least 5%, and always, we drive for more if it's available. We also expect time utilization to be up over 1% or about 1% in 2011, that following a record year, as I said, in 2010. ", "On the CapEx and free cash flow front, our current plan is for net rental CapEx of $425 million to $475 million. And as we've done in 2010 and in 2009, we'll flex this number based on what we're experiencing in the marketplace. Within that net rental CapEx target, we expect to spend a gross number of about $625 million. And that in spite of the fact that we'll invest those levels, we expect that our net free cash flow for the year will be positive.", "We're calling it $10 million to $50 million as a range. And again, we'll be continually evaluating that as we go through the year and update you as we view it in the context of the market.", "In terms of profitability, in the past, we've talked about our cost performance as a dollar cost save. We're going to pivot away from that this year and talk more about flow-through as a measure of how we're driving profitability for the company. So our expectation for 2011 is that we'll have total revenue flow-through to EBITDA of about 65% to 70%. In other words, each dollar of incremental total revenue will translate into about $0.55 or $0.70 of incremental EBITDA.", "Those are all the points that I wanted to make about 2010 and the 2011 outlook. It's a good time now to stop and open the call for questions and answers. So if I could ask the operator to open the call, we'll go to Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc.", "Just one quick comment and clarification on that last statement you made, Bill. It looks like just running some simple math on the revenue growth for this year, that would imply an incremental EBITDA this year of about $160 million or so. Is that how we should roughly be thinking about it? So about a $700 million EBITDA base in '10 growing in that ballpark $160 million kind of range? Is that a fair assessment?", "William Plummer", "David, I won't offer a specific comment on the number. I think we've given enough components, especially with the EBITDA flow-through, so that you can converge on a pretty good sense of what we're thinking about. So I won't offer a comment on your specific number.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. And on that, for drop-through, on my numbers, your EBITDA went up about $70 million last year. And the revenue growth was roughly -- the conversion rate was not terribly different. So, okay, main question though, the margin for '11, when we think of the equipment rental margin, if you look at the history of the company, obviously, back when you got started back in the late '90s, you did have one year around 57%. In '06 it was a shade above 55%. Given what you're seeing on rental rates and your forecast, and obviously, that has a pretty big impact on dropping to the bottom line, how should we think about '11 equipment rental margin versus your history? Should this be the year you get back to your peak level? How should we be thinking about that?", "William Plummer", "Well, I'd certainly -- I'd hesitate to say that we get back to a peak level, but not because that's not where we might end up, but because I would rather not address it that specifically. I do think that we will have a nice improvement based on the components that we've already talked about, and if we achieve what we've got in our plan right now, I'd feel very good about how we've driven those margins over the course of 2011.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc.", "What are the risks on the cost side that, maybe, I'm not appreciating? Again, thinking about how rates drop to the bottom line, how should we -- we can go all the way down to the operating profit line if you want. The cost, I mean, obviously, some years, we've seen fuel costs suddenly become something -- you don't think about that, it's not an insignificant cost for you, for some of your fuel costs. How are you thinking about wages? Is there any change to the comp you\u2019ve given to your sales people as a percent of the rental commissions they bring in? Just what are some of those costs we should be thoughtful about that you're thinking could be maybe a little higher than the Street\u2019s contemplating?", "William Plummer", "So just to offer some comments on the various line items, the relationship of revenue to selling cost\u2019s probably not going to be dramatically different as we go forward. And so I don't know that the percent of sales representative of selling cost you should think about as changing dramatically. Certainly, fuel costs as part of our overall delivery cost environment is something that we're watching very carefully. The trend of oil prices will be a major driver there. Repair and maintenance expense, we're operating at very nice levels of OEC on rent growth in the plan that we got for 2011. And as you might expect, repair and maintenance correlates pretty closely. So R&M expense is an area that we're going to be focused on, and that's one of the key variables in our variable cost bucket. Delivery costs, I mentioned already. Headcount and salary and benefit, our plan has headcount not changing dramatically over the course of the year. And so depending on sort of whether it's slightly plus or slightly minus will be a major driver there. The challenge with headcount is that we are coming off of the prior couple of years where we have restrained merit increases. And so merit increases are going to come back in 2011. So there'll be a headwind from that effect that we're going to have to manage through as the course of the year unfolds.", "Michael Kneeland", "Also, David, we're reinstating our 401 contribution as well. So that's the only other bucket that I would say. But nothing has changed from a material standpoint.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc.", "On CapEx, obviously, it's a pretty healthy number for '11. And clearly, the question's more trying to get a feel for how you view the CapEx for the company over the next couple of years. That strong CapEx number in '11, what is that implying about your thoughts on '12? And how much does the 100% equipment expensing that you have to work with in '11 influence the '11 numbers? I'm just trying to get a feel. If you look out to '12, '13, structurally, are you thinking this is a gross CapEx number that's $700 million, $750 million a couple of years out after that? Or was some of the 100% expensing somewhat related to pulling forward some '12 into '11?", "William Plummer", "The 100% bonus depreciation scheme is not going to be a major impact for us. As may have commented before, we have a fairly large NOL position. It's going to take us a while to work off those NOLs, and so the cash tax benefit of 100% depreciation will be pushed out for us. So it\u2019s a small enough effect so that we're not thinking explicitly about accelerating 2012 or 2011, into 2011 expenditures. In terms of how 2011 reflects our thinking about the longer term, I think the answer has got to be it depends on what we see developing going forward. Our view is that 2011, certainly, will be a nice down payment for growth over the next several years, if the market supports it. So if we go through 2011 and it develops the way we're thinking about right now, then that will give us more confidence that another round of nice investment in 2012 is warranted, and then I could say the same thing about '13 based on '12's performance. That's the way we're really thinking about the level of CapEx going forward. If the market's there, then we'll continue to invest in what we think are high return investments in capital. If the market develops more slowly, then we'll consciously look at dialing back some of the expectations that we might otherwise have had. A little vague, I know, but I think it\u2019s important to understand that the investment decision is going to be keyed off of how we see the market developing, how we see our customer relationships developing and where we think we could put it to work at good returns.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, David, I just want to add that we are spending more CapEx, you're right. It's still down from peaks that we've spent as a company historically. And that we remain focused on free cash flow generation as an organization. And we want to drive our capital expenditures to be much more efficient, that's why we're transferring more equipment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "I guess, the first point, how are you thinking about seasonality this year given what you're seeing so far with the weather and your fleet addition plans?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, there's a seasonal trend every year. Some are more volatile than others. If you recall, the first quarter of last year, we had a significant seasonality swing with a lot of snow. Obviously, we're going through that. That hasn't changed our view on what we think 2011 can deliver. We're very comfortable with that. We planned for it. We understand it. And we just continually look at areas of opportunities, like the new accounts I mentioned. With regards to how our capital will be spent, I don't think it's going to be dramatically different as far as how it's been done in the past because you really want to bring the capital in so that you can get most of it put to work for the season. Having said that, we will spend capital as we have customer demand and as we continue to shift our focus on the national and industrial accounts and to meet those demands.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "And on the fleet additions, you're buying a little bit more equipment than I expected. Could you give some color around the fleet categories you're focusing on? Your latest thoughts there, and maybe dovetailing with that, how able is the industry as a whole to go out and make fleet addition? Is there a strategic advantage there?", "Michael Kneeland", "The first part of that, I'd say that nothing's dramatically going to change from our purchases last year. We're going to be -- obviously, we'll buy aerial and all the products. The question is, will we be buying more on earthmoving? Yes. Will we be buying more in industrial-related products? Yes. And as I mentioned, we'll be expanding in the area of power HVAC and Trench as well. So our pattern and what our goal is hasn't changed. We will increase our percentages in earthmoving and other. And we will have a shift of our forklifts to be also not only reach forklifts, they\u2019ll be higher reach forklifts but also the industrial forklifts. And then from the aerial standpoint, it will come down as a percentage of our total fleet mix. As far as the capacity, I can't speak to everyone's strategy that's out there. As we reported, we're seeing record demand, and we've seen three consecutive quarters. The way in which we focus on it is on customer demand and to make sure that we're staying true to our strategy. Do I think there\u2019s capacity for the vendors to meet our demand? Absolutely. But I think, as an industry, and I go back to rates, we still need to focus on getting an ample return and make sure that what you are buying, you will get those returns over time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chase Becker from Credit Suisse.", "Chase Becker - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "On the free cash flow, just trying to understand the stickiness of the CapEx, assuming that rates end up being better than your 5% assumption. I understand it\u2019s probably more tied to utilization and demand, but just trying to understand how I should be thinking about free cash flow if rental rates do exceed that 5%?", "William Plummer", "I think it's probably not far off to say, \"Look, if rates do better and we therefore generate more operating cash flow, we're probably not far from saying dollar-for-dollar, operating cash flow goes to CapEx.\" Now I hesitate in saying that because we certainly will have a lot of discussion around what the environment might support. But if the momentum is there, our view is let's try and put more fleet to work because we would be doing it in an environment that supports better returns. There's certainly a benefit to adding more fleet. There's certainly an impact on our ability to generate profitability and margin. But there's also an impact on our ability to continue to invest in the fleet to manage fleet age, to manage the mix and to support key customer growth. So we'd look for opportunities to invest more. And if the world goes better than we expect, then we're probably going to bump up the level of investment.", "Chase Becker - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then just in terms of the long-term margin potential for the company, I can appreciate that you've got a significant amount of cost coming out of the structure relative to last cycle, and I understand your normalized margin target. But is there any reason structurally why your peak EBITDA margins next cycle can't be closer to your peers', you were kind of in that 45%, 46% range? Is there anything that I'm missing? It seems like the restructuring actions alone can kind of get you closer to that 40% range, and then you get rates on top of that? I don't know if that's more of an analyst-day-type question or not, but...", "William Plummer", "Yes, probably, but I guess I would answer at a high level. I don't see anything structurally that should keep us from being very competitive with our major competitors in terms of margin. A key question that we would need to wrestle with is, \"Should we let margin go up to the mid-40s?\" Right? Or if you're at that level of performance, your returns are going to be very attractive. Should you be investing more in your business and taking maybe a little bit less marginy kind of investment to drive better net present value of the business? That's the debate that we would have if we were north of 40% and given the opportunity of going 45% versus investing more and maybe staying at 40% and just being a bigger company. So that's the kind of discussion we would have. It's a high-class problem to have. Let's get there first.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just following up on that last question. Your time utilization guidance for this year, up a point, basically gets you to your intermediate-term target of the 67%. So what are the implications of that? I mean, should we think that, that number doesn't go any higher in the next -- in 2012, 2013? I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about time utilization going forward. I mean, it sounds like it's similar to what you were just talking about.", "Michael Kneeland", "I know. As I said, that's the way we're viewing the world going into next year. Keep in mind that the construction by McGraw-Hill\u2019s standards is only going to go up in the low-single digits. But do I think that we can go beyond that? Sure. We have a set goal that we've laid out there to achieve. We've been marching in that direction very nicely. We've had consecutive records for the company. But there's also a component that we are throughout all 10 Canadian provinces, and there's changes in the environment that you can't rent in certain areas because they\u2019re in the outer banks, it's 40 below zero. But that being said, do I think that we can improve our time utilization? Yes. It will also come with the mix, the changes that we have as we layer them in overtime and we continue to develop our customer base.", "William Plummer", "I guess I would add, I agree, 100%. We could drive utilization higher. I think one of the important discussions that we should and will have as a business is, how much higher and whether we should allow utilization to go much higher than 67%, 68%, or should we, again, if the environment supports, should we invest more, grow the fleet more and keep utilization at about that level in the service of growing profitability and improving return? So yes, we could go higher. I have no doubt about that. I\u2019ve become very fully convinced of that fact. The question is how much higher should we go. Again, high-class problem. Let's get there and then we can talk about it.", "Michael Kneeland", "And I would just also point out that it's also balanced against a rate. You want to be able to get the rate. You can drive time in this business all day long, but you've got to balance the two of them.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just on the pricing target, can you just talk a little bit about how we should think about the slope of pricing through the year? I mean if you're looking for a full year number of 5%, presumably, you're going to have to end the year at a pretty robust number. Can you just talk about how we should -- the trajectory of that?", "William Plummer", "So without going into too much detail about how we've laid it out over the quarters, I will point out that the first quarter comps from last year are the easiest in the course of the year. But that said, we believe that there will be enough demand and enough momentum as we get into the second and third quarter in particular, so that there's a sequential rate improvement opportunity for us even in those environments. And then fourth quarter, again, we think that we can continue to trend sequentially rates higher in the fourth quarter. So there's a broad statement. I think the view is that we'll be able to continue to push rates higher as we go throughout the course of the year. The challenge of the comps from the prior year gets harder in the second and third quarter, but we believe that the market will be there to support rate improvement.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Did you not see the typical seasonal softening at the end of the year this year? Is that a fair statement?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, I would say that's a fair statement. If you recall, the 69.3% time utilization is a record, and the performance speaks for itself. And we didn't see that drop off, as Bill mentioned, even with the holidays and the seasonal trend. Is there a seasonal component to our business? Absolutely. But clearly, we outperformed it.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just lastly, I mean, can you just remind us where you are relative to the past peak pricing? Are you down 10 points, 12 points? Is there a number we could think about?", "William Plummer", "So versus the prior peak, recall that we came down 12% in 2009. We came down a little bit in '08 before that. And we came down another 2% this year. So versus the prior peak, somebody have the number handy?", "Michael Kneeland", "21%.", "William Plummer", "So versus the prior peak, 16%, the high teen kind of range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wells from Thompson Research Group.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "I guess, first off on the rental rate expectation front, just looking at the fleet statistics that you put in your deck, with aerials sitting at 74% utilized, I guess I'm trying to get a sense of that 5% expectation, how much of it can you see on the aerial piece? Or is it more in some of the other categories that you're being able to push that lever more effectively?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, as I mentioned, we saw the aerial in weekly and daily terms actually go up in the quarter. We did see a sequential improvement in aerial on the monthly side of things, but it wasn't enough to break through on a year-over-year basis. As we go through the year, we would expect to see more demand and be able to support a price increase for that product as well as we go through the year. So it's really -- we don't break it down specifically by categories. It's much more scientific than that. But we look at it by geography. We look at what we're capable of getting by the customer. We look at utilization and we make judgment calls. And then in some instances, we walk away from deals. And we'll transfer the assets. So it's all the above and how you manage it. But I would expect to see aerial rates improve as we go through 2011.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "And then thinking about the mix of customers, obviously focusing on the larger national account, presumably they're going to be more price savvy or have the leverage in place from a purchasing perspective to get greater scale. Does that hurt the ability to move the rate, that 5%, or are you baking in some of a return, if you will, to that smaller contractor base, that doesn't have the scale in place to push back on rates?", "Michael Kneeland", "No, it's all the above. We negotiate a lot of these rates on an annual basis. Some are set not to exceed pricing. There's a lot of things that we can do to manage those rates more efficiently. We've got systems in place to help us with that. But to your point, the spot customer who wants to come in for that shorter term, yes, depending upon the utilization of that asset and that type of customer, they could probably expect to pay more. So just in general on rates, this is an industry that really needs to focus on rates, needs to get a return on the capital it's employing out there. This is not just for me, it's the whole industry. So I think as we begin to see the turn of the trend of being in the construction, starting to pick up, most companies are seeing sequential improvements. I don't see them stopping. I see them continuing to focus on improving that picture. So it's all the above that will get us there.", "David Wells - Avondale Partners", "And then lastly, just one quick housekeeping question, how should we think about the share count for next year?", "William Plummer", "So with profitability, David, the share count clearly will start to include some of the securities that were anti-dilutive when we were in a loss position. As we look at the full year, assuming that we've got a nice net income position for -- a stock price in the $25 to $30 stock price, we think that the expected fully diluted share count will be somewhere in the, let's say in the mid-70s, as sort of a starting point for the year. So $75 million, let\u2019s say, right in that area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "A couple of scattered ones here. First, Mike, could you address stimulus? What type of -- how material was that in '10? Is that going to be headwind, tailwind? Will that be a headwind, tailwind in '11, and just speaking to infrastructure and your business overall?", "Michael Kneeland", "It really affects the Trench business and the Trench business has seen a nice uptick as it went through the year. And as I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in that line of business. So the stimulus dollars don't peak out until '11. I would say that, that area of the business will continue to go forward as we have been. It ramps up, but it peaks out in '11. But there's a lot of projects that are underway.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Shifting gears, if you do, in fact, end up 2011 doing the CapEx that's been discussed in the outlook, what type of OEC at the end of the year and what type of fleet age are we looking at? And how are you thinking about fleet age?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. Our average for the year, and you can expect our fleet to probably up an average of $100 million for OEC on average. With regards to age, our age is going to be relatively flat. I'll put the goalposts \u2013 it could go a month in either direction. We're very comfortable with that. And we'll continue to monitor it. We still sell the oldest assets, and we're very active in our fleet management program.", "William Plummer", "In terms of the fleet size at the end of the year, you can back into it reasonably closely, but say the fleet goes up 175 to 200, in that range.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then finally, just on the self-insurance. Mike, could you speak to your safety record? Is there anything we should be concerned about? Just a progress update there.", "Michael Kneeland", "No, this is something that's very important to the company. It was also pointed out in our engagement surveys where we've got one of the highest scores on safety. We continue to improve our safety in all areas that Bill mentioned, both in general liability, our recordable rate as well as our automotive. So it's something that we take very seriously. And in fact, we have a program where every employee has to go through on an annual basis, including myself. And we're very stringent around safety. It's very core to our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Emily Shanks from Barclays Capital.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "But I did want to ask just a follow-up around the fleet age. As you gave color around CapEx spend being targeted, if I heard correctly, around earthmoving and industrial-type products and that aerial will become a lower percentage of the fleet mix, should that naturally take your fleet age down or not materially?", "William Plummer", "Not materially, I mean, if you think about it. I mean, obviously, when you buy new, it brings it down. But a lot of our aerial fleet, we refurbished, and we're going to hold on to it. And so you'll see that age out over time, especially a lot of the booms, and to a lesser degree, some of the larger forklifts. So we see that as a viable alternative to buying some of these assets. So that has an impact as well. But again, as I mentioned, it's going to fluctuate a month in either direction, and we're very comfortable. And you can see by the utilization that we have out there, that our service ability on these assets is just fine.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "This may sound completely counter to what everybody else is asking, but in the event of a double dip or another pullback, are you comfortable with the fleet age where it is? And how much longer would you want to age it or would you be comfortable taking it to?", "Michael Kneeland", "We haven't crossed that path yet, but aging it out does not scare me. We're always prepared for a double dip, if need be. We're not afraid to make those choices, whether it be selling assets or going through and doing what we have to, make hard choices. We've done that. We'll do it again if need be. I just don't think that, that's in the cards, but you never know. That's beyond our control at this point. But as far as aging the fleet out, if we had to age it out even further, it would not bother me. Our R&M expense would go up, but it wouldn't go up dramatically.", "Operator", "This does conclude the question-and-answer period of today's program. I'd like to turn the program back for any concluding remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you, Operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And as always, you're welcome for follow-up calls, here in branch, getting hold of Fred Bratman or visiting one of our locations. And I just want to remind everyone that next week, we're holding an Investor Day on February 11, in New York City, starting at noon Eastern Time. We will be webcasting the event to a link on our website, so I hope you join us. With that, I think that concludes today, and we'll talk to you after the first quarter.

Well, last night, we reported numbers that showed significant progress towards our targets as part of a multiyear strategy that is focused on profitable growth and margin expansion. And as you know, we reported earnings per share of $0.38 on 16% increase in rental revenue. Our rates were up more than 6% year-over-year and with a stronger performance each month in the quarter. To give you an example, rates were up 5.4% year-over-year in April, 6.2% in May and 7.2% in June. And time utilization of 69%, which by the way, was up fifth consecutive quarter of record time utilization and we did it on a larger fleet.", "And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, up 3 percentage points year-over-year. And these numbers are solid in their own right, especially given our operating environment but they also reflect a strategy that is engineered for long-term improvement of our operations, our market opportunities and the financial attractiveness of our business. Virtually every arm of our strategy is clearly working, however, there's more to come. Now for example, our model is capable of generating more operating leverage to continuous improvement of our cost structure, and one priority is our cost of rent. Some of the increase we saw in the quarter was a consequence of volume but we believe there are untapped efficiencies and we're looking hard at those opportunities.", "And at the same time, we want to make sure that any moves that we make are in the best long-term interest of our company. We're not interested in quick fixes. And the actions that we're taking, like investments in technology, are strategically sound for us.", "Now look, as a whole, we hit the midyear point solidly in line with our internal expectations. And that was no small feat given that this is not a summer of recovery for construction as some industry analysts originally forecasted. Nonresidential construction for the U.S. year-to-date is still declining from 2010, with May being particularly weak in terms of construction starts. Now other indicators like the Architectural Billing Index are reflecting the choppiness that seems to be the main characteristic of this recovery. And the ABI has bumped around between 47 and 50 since January. It's slightly better than last year, but overall, still disappointing.", "And the industrial sector is doing better, both in the U.S. and Canada. And we've put our company in a strong position to capitalize in this opportunity with our recent acquisitions of the Venetor Group in Ontario and the GulfStar acquisition in Texas and Louisiana. And we made these acquisitions because they tie so well to our strategy. Together, they contributed almost $6 million of EBITDA in the quarter.", "So also on the bright side, our customers are reporting that they're seeing more bid activity, which is consistent with what we're hearing from other sources. And the backlog of our larger customers seems to be improving.", "And the biggest challenge for contractors right now is margin, and that pressure is being felt along the whole supply chain. So how are we getting double-digit growth in this environment, in a nutshell? When we formulated our customer segmentation strategies several years ago, we got it right. For our key customer groups, demand is up more than the market overall. In addition, when we signed these customers, we knew that we had the ability to earn more of their business through superior customer service. We estimate that our share of wallet with National Accounts run about 53% through June, which is significantly higher than last year. In other words, our segmentation strategy is unfolding exactly as envisioned. And all of our operating regions had positive growth in the quarter.", "And we had double-digit growth in key strategic areas, let me go over some of them. Rental revenue for National Accounts was up 17% year-over-year; Industrial was up 18%, included the impact of the acquisitions; and our Key Account business was up 16%. Our Trench, Power, HVAC business had a very robust, up 29% growth due to the combination CoStar's, [ph] our acquisition and demand for our specialized expertise.", "Canada, which is being compared against a banner year in 2010, was up 45% in the quarter and even if you exclude the impact of Venetor, it was still up significantly. So the provinces are becoming more important part of our business. Now as I've mentioned before, we also believe that we're benefiting from the secular shift towards rental, as well as the growing appeal of our brand as a premier customer service provider. These 2 dynamics can be difficult to measure but one thing is clear from our performance this year, this is not increasing utilization on our fleet by buying share at the expense of rental rates. We can say that with confidence because as many of you know, Rouse, has initiated metric tracking in our industry, and rates are part of the data that we see.", "Now all of our employees understand the importance of rates and return on assets. Our approach to fleet management is much more disciplined this year and well-rounded than our prior cycles. And our CapEx plan for the year, which Bill will discuss in a minute, are calculated to drive returns, not just in 2011 or 2012, but over the full life of the asset. And we see opportunities to protect key relationships with certain types of fleet, but we also see more room to push rate in local markets. ", "Let me give you an example of how hard we've been fighting for rates out there in the trenches. In the second quarter, we continued to shift toward monthly rentals, which as you all know is part of our strategy. Last year, monthly rentals was 69.6% in the quarter and this year, they're 72.8%, up very nicely. And that's part of what we call the period mix. We collect fewer dollars per day on a monthly rental but these transactions are typically more profitable than daily or weekly term. Now in addition to that, National Accounts as a percentage of rental revenue increased 33% in the quarter and these are negotiated agreements tend to be more competitive on rates. But even with that, we brought rates up more than 6% in the quarter. And so we stayed through to our strategy of transforming our customer mix, while at the same time we did the most effective job yet of raising rates in this cycle. In fact, rates were up at every one of our target customer groups and at every equipment category.", "Our performance in the quarter also makes an important statement about the cohesiveness of our company, particularly our field operations. And our continuing to invest in this field will pay off both revenue and cost control. Now we've already done that with CORE, which is the software our branches used to manage rates. And we're also continuing to rollout our fast technology, which should bring more efficiency to our logistics end of our business.", "Investments in technologies are not bandaids, they are a prudent way to improve our top line and our bottom line by changing the fundamentals of how we do business.", "So looking ahead, it's obvious to everyone that there's a lot of macro uncertainty out there. It can be difficult to pin down end-market behavior with any real precision. And that's the reality of our marketplace, but it's not our reality. Our results have defined operating environment because they are being propelled by strategic plan that does not rely on rebound in our end markets. And that gives us a lot of confidence that tells us that we can make progress where we need to. And we expect our performance to remain robust for the balance of this year.", "The 35% adjusted EBITDA margin we reported in the second quarter for our company, it's a solid step forward to our bridge to our near-term growth of $1 billion of EBITDA and stronger margins. Equipment rental like a lot of industries may be looking at the new normal but this is a new United Rentals, and we're prepared to take that on. ", "So on that note, I'll stop here and I'll ask Bill to review our second quarter numbers and then we'll take your questions and we'll go from there. So over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll give you some more detail on the quarter, a little bit more color on the drivers and then spend a little time updating the outlook for the remainder of 2011.", "Starting with revenues. Overall, revenues were up solidly, as Mike said. Rental revenues were up 16.4% within that rate and time utilization strong drivers, rates being up 6.1% year-over-year and time utilization also being very strong, 69%, or up 3.3 percentage points over last year.", "Dive into rates a little bit more deeply, that 6.1% year-over-year performance was one of the stronger quarters that we've seen in the history of the company. If you look at it sequentially, the second quarter was up 1.8 percentage points compared to the first quarter. Again, very strong, relative to where we've seen second quarter's come in sequentially in the history of the company.", "If you break down the months within the first -- excuse me, the second quarter of rental rate performance, Mike gave you the year-over-year as by month, just to flesh that out a little bit more, the sequentials by month were as follows: April was up 6/10 sequentially versus March; May was up 1.1 percentage points versus April; and June was up 2 percentage points versus May. So a nice robust sequential growth in the quarter on rental rates as well.", "If you look at rates year-to-date, our year-to-date rate is up 5.2 percentage points over last year and that's very clearly in line with the guidance that we've given for rates over the full year of 2011. So we feel very comfortable of being able to deliver that 5% or more for rate performance in 2011.", " ", "Looking at volume and time utilization. OEC on rent, our measure of volume, was up 13.8% year-over-year in the quarter. That happened along with an increase in fleet size. Our average fleet size was up just under 8% over the second quarter last year. Put those 2 together and you get the time utilization performance that we mentioned, 69%, up 3.6 percentage points over the prior year. That is a fifth consecutive quarterly record for the company in time utilization performance,, and it certainly bodes well for the second half starting out on a strong note.", "That's enough about rental revenue for now, let me move to used equipment briefly. Used equipment proceeds for the quarter were $41 million, and that's up from $37 million the prior year. More importantly, the gross margins were quite nice in the quarter. We realized 31.7% gross margin on our used sales in the quarter this year, that's up 7.4 percentage points compared to last year. And as has been the case recently, the main driver was the channel mix. We continue to flow a tremendous amount of our used sales activity through our own retail channel. It was about 68% in the second quarter this year, that's up from 61%, prior year. Auction also continues to decline, again, as has been the case recently. We are only 12% auction in the mix this quarter, and that's down from 22% in second quarter of last year. So continued good performance in the used equipment sales in the quarter. As we look forward, we certainly expect to continue to drive good robust used equipment volume over the second half. We will continue to manage also the margin, the challenge there is that we plan, as we've said in our previous filings, to use more sales-to-vendors as one of the channels this year. And that made depressed the margin that we realized somewhat in the second half compared to the first half.", "Let me move briefly to our cost performance in the quarter. Starting with cost of rent x depreciation. They were up $29 million on a year-over-year basis versus last year. Within that $29 million of unfavorability, volume accounted for about $10 million of it and I'll point out that the volume included little under $5 million of re-rent expense increase compared to last year. So $10 million attributed to volume of the overall $29 million year-over-year change.", "Compensation contributed about $5 million to that change. That included increases in profit sharing among our field operations, as well as the increase in merit increases that we told you about in the first quarter. Those combined gave you the $5 million for comp, along with compensation, we also had about $5 million impact from the acquisitions in our year-over-year cost of rent performance. That's just the straight add of their cost.", "Fuel pricing was another driver. Our fuel prices were up roughly 33% on a year-over-year basis. We did have hedges in places as we have mentioned but even so, the hedge prices were such that our fuel impact this quarter was significant. About $3 million of the $29 million was due to fuel price differences this year versus last. The remainder is a host of items, fleet age, we talked about that in the past. Fleet age contributed a little under $2 million of incremental expense, just servicing an older fleet. We had an insurance benefit last year that didn't repeat this year, that contributed roughly $2 million and then the remainder was a host of puts and takes on a variety of lines within our cost of rent.", "Moving briefly to SG&A performance. We continue to leverage our SG&A more effectively as we go forward this year. In the second quarter, SG&A represented 15.9% of revenue and that's a 30-basis point improvement over last year. The SG&A dollars were up $10 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year, and the big drivers of that change were compensation with the G&A-related bonuses being up with higher performance and volume was another significant driver, primarily commission expense increases with the higher revenue. The other components of SG&A change were puts and takes here and there, including about $0.5 million of fuel here as we include fuel for our management vehicles in SG&A as opposed to in cost of rent. Another $0.5 million to represent the increase in investments in things like FAST and CORE systems over last year and then a host of puts and takes elsewhere in the SG&A area.", "So let me move now to profitability, starting with EBITDA. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, you saw the report of $221 million for the quarter and that's up nicely versus last year. 23% improvement over last year, obviously driven by the key components that I mentioned in revenue and cost. As a percent of sales, Mike mentioned 35% is a very nice increase of 300 basis points over the prior year and it represents a record for the company in the second quarter in its history.", "Moving to EPS, GAAP EPS of $0.38 for the quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.40 for the quarter were nice improvements over the prior year. On an adjusted EPS basis prior year was $0.25, for example. So a nice robust improvement there as well.", "Let me just address our fleet management activity briefly in the quarter, first, starting with fleet transfers. We continue to transfer fleet at a rapid pace across the business to leverage the fleet that we have as effectively as possible. Transfers total about $1.4 billion in the current quarter, that's very comparable to where we've been over the last number of quarters. As we think about the size of the fleet, we reported already that the average fleet size increased almost 8% year-over-year. Clearly, that reflects the spending that we've been doing. Our gross CapEx in the second quarter for rental fleet was $297 million and the net rental CapEx was very robust as well, well north of $250 million. We continue to look for opportunities to invest in our fleet. And we're investing in those places where we get the best bang for our buck. So, for example, of that $2.97 gross spend in the second quarter, 20% of it was spent in Canada, and Mike told you about the strength that we're seeing up there. Of the spend in the second quarter, we continue to emphasize those categories of equipment that represent the best opportunity, i.e. earthmoving equipment and generant categories like generators, compressors, trucks and other general categories. And we continue to spend albeit at a lower than pro rata share on scissor lifts and other aerial work platforms. AWPs were about 33% of our overall spend, for example, in the second quarter compared to a mid-40s percent share of our overall portfolio.", "Touching quickly on cash flow and liquidity. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of $118 million, clearly reflecting the heavy CapEx spend. That brings our year-to-date free cash flow to a use of $48 million. This is still very much in line with our view of being free cash flow positive for the year and so we look for nice positive free cash flow over the third and fourth quarters as we finish out the year. I'll touch on that when we go through the outlook as well. In terms of liquidity, we finished the quarter with a total of about $610 million of overall liquidity. That includes our ABL availability, our cash availability and our AR facility.", "Let me briefly update our outlook for 2011. As you all are familiar, we have been guiding to rate performance for the year of 5% or more. And as I said earlier, we still feel very comfortable that we will be able to achieve the 5% or more for the full year, even though the comps get more challenging in the second half, given the increases that we saw in rental rate during the second half of last year.", "On time utilization, the year has been very robust and we are therefore raising our expectation. Year-over-year, we expect time utilization to be up 2.5 percentage points, compared to our previous target of up 1 percentage point. On a CapEx basis, we now expect to spend about $650 million of gross rental CapEx, that's up $25 million versus our prior guidance. We also have raised our expectations of net rental CapEx for the year to the range of $450 million to $500 million. Again, up $25 million. ", "Even with this increased spend, however, we still expect to be free cash flow positive. We're now saying between $5 million and $10 million of positive free cash flow for the year and as always, we'll continue to look to drive that even more positive given the opportunity.", "In terms of our flow-through outlook for the year, we are revising our view of where flow-through for the year will come in. From 65% to 70% previously, we now see it at 62% to 67% for the full year, and again that's adjusted EBITDA to total revenue as a flow-through measure. The decline of 3 percentage points reflects the impact of the acquisitions. You can all do the math, you can see when you add acquisitions, you add 100% of the revenue but you only add EBITDA at their margin not at their normal flow through, and that's the impact that we're anticipating and leading us to decline, to reduce the range of expected flow-through for the year.", "I'll stop there and open up the call for Q&A. But before we do, I just like to offer my view, which echoes the view that Mike espoused. This was a strong quarter for us in so many ways. We're very pleased to be able to deliver the rate that we did in the quarter, 6.1% increase. We're very pleased with the level of time utilization on the fleet that we've been able to achieve, it's very robust, that in the face of an increased fleet size. And we're also pleased at the margin expansion that we've been able to deliver, 300 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. So that's a great starting point to finish out the year. ", "Why don't we stop here and ask for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi", "A couple of questions and I think you touched on this before. Obviously, you had pretty strong growth for rental revenues. Obviously, you talked about the weak macro environment. And I guess the question that we, as analysts get consistently, is where is the growth coming from? So perhaps if you can touch on that a bit. And then I have 2 more follow-ups, please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. Basically, when we talk to a lot of our customers, obviously, given the uncertainty in the marketplace, coupled with the fact that the credit markets are still very tight, particularly for lower tier type of clients, they're going to be prone to renting. You talk to them, we see it in our new account activity and then we see our current customers, we're focusing on rental. Given the fact that a lot of the jobs they have are various jobs that they wouldn't otherwise would have not been bidding on. So the need to have the depth of equipment is going to be very important for them. That, along with our strategy of focusing on the customers, of making sure that we earn their worthiness to rent from us, through our service, is very important. So I look at it as a 3-pronged approach. It's our strategy with our go-to-market with single point of contact, focusing on the customer with that one-on-one relationship and following the customer with our customer service and the uncertainty and the tight credit markets. And keep in mind, Manish, as you know, during the downturn, a lot of companies, not only the large public companies but a lot of companies de-fleeted and they don't have the ability to fleet up because of the credit market. So I think a combination of all those things are playing true to the industry today.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi", "Okay, wonderful. My second question touches on the Rouse information package that you have been receiving and I was hoping that perhaps if you can offer some high-level comment on how you stack up vis-\u00e0-vis some of the participants in the study and where do you see the opportunities for the company?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, it's a newly formed metric program that they put forward. Rouse puts them out there, the key metrics things like rates, age, dollar utilization, time utilization and they are working very closely with ARA. As you know, we're supporters of ARA, coming out with a set of industry standards so that we can all look at the world at the same way, for the investors. That's why I said we get this confidence on our rental rates but that we're not growing our time utilization at the sacrifice of rate. That I can say with confidence based on the data that they're supplying to us.", "William Plummer", "We're well-positioned, Manish, in almost every one of those measures, relative to the competitors that are included in the survey. So we feel pretty good. Obviously, there's always room to improve but for the markets that we seen out of Rouse, whether it's dollar utilization, time, whatever measure, we are at or near the top in the reports that we've seen.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi", "Got you. And then just lastly, obviously, we're week 3 into July, can you just give us some initial impressions of how July has faired?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I would just tell you that, again, we took up our guidance on a time utilization. So it's safe to say that we continue to see that level of activity go forward in July, and as well as a rate improvement -- sequential rate improvement, month-over-month.", "William Plummer", "I've been using the word robust so I think that, that gives you a sense whether it's rate or time, there's a pretty strong start to July.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi", "Okay, so the best is yet to come?", "William Plummer", "I didn't say that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Michael, we have rising engine regulations for under 150-horsepower construction equipment coming next year, I'm wondering if you can talk about what proportion of your fleet will benefit from rising replacement costs as a result? And what's the extent of replacement cost increases do you see for those product lines, based on your conversations with OEMs?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, that's great. And for everyone on the call today, as Jerry's alluding to is called the Tier 4 and that's 75 to 175 horsepower which is required in 2012. And the manufacturers have been struggling and working diligently to reengineer their products, to get those things ready for the demand that we will all be looking for next year. As far as the company is concerned, the way we look at it, and we've analyzed it, our fleet team does a lot of work on this, dividing out the different types of engines and requirements that are needed. Right here, now today, about 3% to 5% of our total units, or about 10% to 15% of our total fleet would fit in that category. Now you're not going to replace that all in one year and keep in mind on the larger products, the engine is a small portion of the total piece of equipment. So when we look at what the cost impact could be next year, it's not going to be a significant number as we reported this year. I mean, I think our prices were flat to up 1%. I think what we would see next year are blended increase in the low-single digits, given the fact that it's small percentage of our total fleet.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And just a clarification question in terms of the 2013 piece, can you tell us the proportion of your fleet that will be impacted at that point? I believe it's all under 75 horsepower at that point?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, that's correct. That actually fits the whole bucket. Anything over 75 horsepower fits in that complete tier I just talked to you about.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And 2013 will be under 75 though, do you know what horsepower of your fleet?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, it goes to 25 to 75. We've been working diligently for several years on the lower class assets. So again, we don't see it going up significantly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank.", "Philip Volpicelli", "My first question is regard to the free cash flow guidance, you guys clearly I think made a point of keeping it to $5 million to $10 million positive. Does that underscore management's commitment to stay free cash flow positive this year?", "William Plummer", "It does, Phil. It's Bill here. We view that as a good disciplined mechanism for ourselves to make sure that we're using our fleet as effectively -- our existing fleet, as effectively as possible. And so it's sort of arbitrary but it is a good disciplined mechanism for us as we go through the year. Now that's not to say that we're religious about it. I think I may have said this on a previous call. If we see very strong opportunities with important key customers, that prompt us to say, this is the business that we want for the long haul. We might dip into free cash flow negative for the right set of reasons but we're being very, very conscious about when we might decide to do that. And the statement of staying $5 million to $10 million of free cash flow positive is a statement that as we look at things right now, we think that's the right place to be.", "Philip Volpicelli", "Great, understood. And then just on the volume and the rate question, was there any change in mix or was there any discounting of delivery costs or fees?", "Michael Kneeland", "The delivery is not part of that rate calculation.", "William Plummer", "Yes, I'm not quite sure I heard your question. So was it that was there a change in mix in the second quarter?", "Philip Volpicelli", "Yes, what I'm trying to do Bill is that when I look at volumes being up 13.8% and revenue being up 16% and change, with rates being up 6.1%, there's obviously some give up there. And I'm wondering if that's mix or if it's just the way you, guys, talk about rates versus the way I might calculate what I call yield?", "William Plummer", "Okay, I got you. So it's clearly a mix impact. We have shifted more of our revenue to monthly rates this year, compared to second quarter last year. The monthly mix this year is up about 320 basis points higher as a share of our total revenue than it was last year. And as you know, because of the pricing structure of the industry, the average daily revenue that you achieve from a monthly rental is less than if you rented it on a daily rate basis, or weekly rate basis. So that's a phenomenon, that's clearly playing through our revenue performance. We knew it was coming, right? It was an exclusive part of our strategy, as a matter of fact. We pursued the national and large regional accounts because they rent more and they rent for a longer period of time. And it offers the opportunity to serve them at a lower cost point. So it was exclusively part of the strategy we've been pursuing. We certainly saw it in the second quarter and it had an impact.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Emily Shanks from Barclays Capital.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "This is somewhat a follow-up to Phil's question. I was just curious. I noticed that beginning last quarter you stoped reporting dollar utilization on the full fleet. I see it by type of fleet, do you have that number and/or was there a reason for not including that any longer?", "Michael Kneeland", "The dollar utilization for the fleet was 49.9%.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you. And just one other housekeeping item, what is the OEC on a out-to-the-million number?", "William Plummer", "I'm sorry, Emily, say that again?", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "I'm just looking at what the OEC dollar amount is out past the 4.18, do you have what the next decimal point?", "William Plummer", "Okay. This is where Chris Brown gets his cameo appearance. Go, Chris.", "Christopher Brown", "4.175, Emily.", "William Plummer", "Well, done.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. And then one other -- thank you, Chris. One other housekeeping item, you did highlight the fact that you are looking at hitting the $1 billion mark on EBITDA in the near term, and I want to get a sense from you, is that something that you think you're going to be running -- hitting on a run rate by year end, or is that next year's business, what sort of the time frame associated with that?", "Michael Kneeland", "Emily, in the investor presentation, we put together a bridge on our EBITDA to get over at or above $1 billion over the next 2 to 3 years. Again, as I mentioned, that's our near-term goal and we clearly see our focus on our way there. And we look at the second quarter as a step in the right direction.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. And then if I could just one more quick question. Bill, thank you for the comments around the used equipment sales margins and what the trends are we should expect to see in the second half. It looks like your year-over-year gains in 2Q are less than in 1Q, should we just assume that, that will continue to compress in the back half of this year, around gross profit margin?", "William Plummer", "Yes, that's a fair assumption, Emily. It'll obviously vary with how much of the vendor sales that we do in the third quarter versus fourth quarter. But that it's fair to assume that the trend will decline.", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "But you are still looking for gains, right?", "William Plummer", "I'm sorry, say that again?", "Emily Shanks - Lehman Brothers", "You are still looking to be up year-over-year for gross profit margin expansion, right?", "William Plummer", "For margin expansion, we haven't guided to the full year margin performance. I will say that the full year margin for used sales will be lower than what we've seen in the first half, but we haven't gotten more specific than that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Quick question. I think your message on how to think about incrementals is very clear, so appreciate that. What I was hoping you might be able to speak to is at least thinking about the third quarter and fourth quarter, how should we think about the interplay, we call it rates and costs, which will face various comps and I know you don't give explicit margin guidance but at least maybe some framework to think about how those 2 forces will counterbalance over the next couple of quarters?", "William Plummer", "So Ted, I'll take a shot at it but please, if I don't address your question, ask it again a different way. As we look at -- maybe I'll frame it in terms of our flow-through performance, given that we gave an outlook there. As we look at flow-through, the impact of having relatively more of your year-over-year rate being generated by time utilization versus rate is to depress your flow-through, right? Because time brings along the variable costs associated with getting the equipment out on rent. That's quite honestly one of the phenomenons that we dealt with in the second quarter. And the strong time utilization performance that we had and while rate was strong, time was more of a surprise to the upside, if you will, and it tended to depress the realization of flow-through in the second quarter. That phenomenon could continue in the third and fourth quarter if time continues to be very strong, relative to rate. So that's one of the things that we think about in terms of judging the interplay of rate and time as it impacts flow-through. And all of these is excluding the impact of acquisitions. So in the third quarter, we could see -- you saw in the second quarter here, our flow-through of adjusted EBITDA was only about 58%. In the third quarter, you could see something like that again, where the flow-through is a little less than the overall range we've given of 62% to 67%. But we think that it will -- we'll make up for that in the fourth quarter, and we'll certainly continue to drive for all of the flow-through that we can. But one other thing, if I could, on the second half as it relates to flow-through performance, we know that we've got some events coming in the second half that are going to help us. In particular, in the fourth quarter, we know that last year, we took the $18 million self-insurance reserve adjustment in the fourth quarter. That's not going to repeat this year. We feel very confident that, that was an unusual set of items in our self-insurance activities. So there is an $18 million benefit in the fourth quarter that will help flow-through significantly in that quarter. So you have to think about those specific items as you think about flow-through.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "So that's actually very helpful. And I guess and I know you don't give specific quarterly guidance on pricing but should we think about pricing at least as offsetting or counterbalancing some portion of that incremental costs realized in higher time utilization? Or is it going to be more neutral impact?", "William Plummer", "So it all depends on what kind of rate you're able to realize, whether it offsets the incremental. I'm not saying that incremental time utilization is a bad thing, please, don't take that away. It's a very good thing. It's just as it relates to the flow-through calculation, if you get your revenue from time instead of rate, then you're going to get less flow-through than if you got it the other way around. That's all I'm trying to say.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Just going back to the pull-through discussion, I guess I also appreciate the color there in the acquisitions. Given just your last comment about having this tailwind from not the fourth quarter is going to have the easier comp because the insurance settlement last year or the insurance expense last year. I mean, what can we think about as sort of the normalized pull-through for next year? I mean is 2012, is that still a 65% to 70% number that we should be thinking about for next year?", "William Plummer", "Yes. Seth, I'd rather not get into 2012. We'll update as we get a little closer, get through our planning process and have a better sense of where we're going to fall on certain key decisions like the amount of fleet spend, for example. So because that number is so sensitive to different decisions, let's leave it until we get into 2012 in more detail.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. To ask then I guess a question on pricing. Maybe how would you characterize the health of kind of the other 70% of the market that's outside of top 10, I mean, are they distressed? I guess I'm trying to understand, is there a ceiling on how high you can raise prices? I mean, you already alluded to sort of some margin pressure at your customers. I mean, if the 70% of the other rental guys are not doing very well, what's to prevent them from just getting more aggressive on pricing and so I'm just trying to understand how high you feel like you could push pricing here?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. Obviously, we have a goal that we want to climb back in our bridge and then we want to get back 10 to 11 points from the bottom of '10 at a minimum. And we're not going to stop there, by the way. To talk about the market, my sense is everyone is going to see rate improvements. This is an industry that definitely has to go over it's cost of capital that it's going to be necessary to sustain itself over time. So my sense is that everyone will start to benefit from the rates and the demand that they're seeing in the marketplace, whether people get aggressive, depends upon their strategy. There are some pockets where there's some areas of the country aren't doing as well as other areas. Are they being more competitive, absolutely, but there's areas like Canada that are expanding nicely. So I think in general, in order for people to expand their fleets, they're going to have to be able to show that they can have the ability to pay back their loans over time. And so I think the trend will be towards better improvement in rates.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay, thank you. And then I guess if I could just one quick follow-up. Is there a fleet OEC number that we should be thinking about target for the end of the year?", "William Plummer", "Well, we haven't given an explicit number. I think it's fair to say that if you use -- you can back into it fairly closely, Seth, if you use something like 48% of OEC as the used sales activity where we'll end up on used sales activity. So that will tell you how to translate proceeds into OEC and then we've given you the gross CapEx and that will tell you the used OEC sold and you can back in to a number from that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Chang from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Peter Chang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Given that we're almost at a 5% increase in utilization if we average Q1 and Q2 and Bill's comments that so far July has been robust, is the reason why your target of utilization growth being only 2.5% higher, is that because of tougher comps, because you're growing your fleet? Or should we be expecting some significant seasonal fall-off in Q4 versus Q4 of last year?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I think you just hit -- all of the items, I would tell you, yes, we're going to tighter comps. Two, there is typically a seasonal. We don't know what the winter will bring to us and whether it will come sooner or later. But it's really going to be based on customer demand out there, and we know we brought it up for full year, 2.5%. Could it be another 0.5 point? Possibly. But we are bringing more fleet in and we'll update everybody as we go through the third quarter. So we'll have better visibility into the fourth.", "William Plummer", "Yes, just to remind you, last year, third quarter, our utilization was 71.3%. Fourth quarter, it was 69.3%. So those were, as we pointed out, records for those quarters in the history of the company. And we're just mindful that we are comping against records last year, along with the other factors that Mike mentioned.", "Peter Chang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Great. Thank you, that's helpful. And then I just had a question on Slide 13 of your presentation deck, it looks like in May, strategic accounts growth spiked up to 40% year-over-year and I just wanted to know if there was any sort of large one-off project that contributed to that or just anything unusual?", "Michael Kneeland", "No, nothing is really unusual. I mean, it's really -- those are going after individual accounts across North America. And we're tracking them on a daily basis through our sales efforts, and following the customer. As I mentioned before, even with our National Accounts, and our share of wallet increased nicely, significantly on a year-over-year basis. So we're earning more share of their wallet and those are the things that we track.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Wells from Thompson Research.", "David Wells - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "First off, looking at the rental rate guidance for the full year, here we are, I guess, kind of half way through and you've raised time utilization. You're already on a year-to-date basis over the guidance. So I guess I'm trying to understand, what is it that may be lurking in the second half of the year that gives you more pause for concern, that would make you hesitate from raising that 5% number for the rest of the year here?", "William Plummer", "So I wouldn't say that there's anything that gives us concern about the second half. We are mindful of the fact that the second half last year, in addition to being strong utilization environment, was a strong rate environment for us. We had rates marching up continuously through the second half last year and so the comps do get tougher just as a matter of history. So that's what we're thinking about. We know that we've got to continue to manage rate higher in the third and fourth quarter in order to preserve that 5.2% that we got year-to-date. And we're confident that we can do that. The question becomes, how much more than that can you do? We feel good about the environment. Could it be better? As Mike said, yes, it could be better but it's hard to say right here and now that we want to put a lot more, especially for the full year, right? Because you got to drag the average that you've already achieved higher if you're going to raise the full year average outlook. So we're being what we think of us as observant of what the market is today and how we'd have to perform compared to last year in order to raise that rate outlook anymore than where it is.", "David Wells - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "That's helpful. And then to your point earlier in the call about seeing some additional re-rent expense, if you could walk us through the thoughts around using re-rent versus just doing more CapEx, and was this kind of a go one-off-type instance, or your thoughts around that will be helpful to?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, David. It's Mike. I've been in the industry for 33 years and the term re-rent has been around for many, many years and just not everybody uses it. The reason why you do re-rent are really 2 reasons. One of which is if you have an immediate need, you determine whether it's prudent to have that machine hold in from wherever it may be, look at what the cost is and how long you're going to need it and then you make a business decision. When we take about the re-rent and when we look at the large percentage of their re-rents that occurred in the second quarter, it was really because what we're doing is performing more services for our current customers. We're renting assets that they're asking us to supply for them that we typically don't carry. And in fact, as some of our customers, as part of our agreement, we have to supply things that we don't carry. For an example, we don't carry cranes with the exception of the acquisition that we had up in Canada. So if we need a crane as part of our contract, we'll get a third party to get in there and then we'll go for it. So that's the reason. Actually, I look at it as a positive because our customers are relying on us to do more for them as part of their services.", "David Wells - Thompson Research Group, LLC.", "That's helpful, I appreciate your thoughts around that. And then lastly, if you look at the kind of percentages of wallet that you gave earlier on the call being at 53% for your larger accounts, how much higher do you think that, that number can go? And then ultimately, I would assume that most of these folks are going to want to have at least a couple of suppliers, just to make sure they are optimizing their pricing. Do you read the situation then where to continue to grow those businesses, we ultimately have to see some in-market growth return to the construction market?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, obviously, you're going to have to -- to answer your question, we're going to see some end-market growth. At some point it will come. It's not going to be held down forever. And even when I said that the ABI Index is showing some choppiness, it has improved year-over-year. It's just still disappointing that it doesn't have consistent growth at 50 or above. That being said, with our share of wallet at 53%, that's a great percentage. Not done yet, do I expect to have 100%? No, not at all. We want to earn the lion's share of our business and that is going to be based on customer-by-customer. In some instances, we may be as high as 70%, 75% of their business. And we fully understand that there are some products that we don't carry and there are some products that they will want to have as a backup, fully understand that. I'm very pleased with the results that the team has put together. It really shows that our services, our customer service and our model is proving true.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "Could you talk a little bit about the timing of used equipment sales in the third and fourth quarter? Just philosophically, would you hold equipment for selling late in the year to maximize the fleet available in the peak third quarter?", "William Plummer", "Yes, Henry, that's a very common way to approach it. It's one that make sense. You would want -- we're getting a lot of feedback on the call here. You would want to hold the equipment through the peak season, if you can. And then get rid of it when it normally would be coming off rent anyway. So if this year will be back-end loaded, as many years are, back-end loaded in our used sales activity to reflect that.", "Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. On M&A, you made a few acquisitions so far this year. Could you talk about your latest thoughts there. Are there still areas of interest or would you prefer to integrate the existing deals?", "Michael Kneeland", "Henry, this is Mike. Yes, obviously, we're going to integrate those. In fact, GulfStar is already been integrated. And we're in the final stages of integrating the Venetor because it's a much larger acquisition. We're always looking for things that strategically fit with the company. And as we've always said -- a lot of feedback here on the call here so I apologize if it's going through to everybody. But basically, when we look at this acquisitions, strategically, they have to fit with the company, they have to be a cultural fit and they also have to have an incremental margin improvement to the company, internal rate of return that's positive. And those are the 3 key areas. The level of activity continues to grow and we see opportunities, and some we passed on and some we find of interest. So we'll continue to focus on those but the key area to think about is it has to be strategic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Mike, earlier in the call, you talked about URID coupling to a certain extent from what your end markets might do. I realize that you don't want to get too specific on next year, but with the ABI softening again this morning to 46, should non-res be flattish or slightly down again in 2012? Is it reasonable to think that rates and fleet size could increase again next year? Even if you talk directionally about the possible impact on fleet size and pricing in a challenging non-res environment, I think that would be helpful.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, Joe. I mean, look, anything is possible, right? And as Bill mentioned, we'll have a better picture as we go through into the fourth quarter of what 2013 will look like. So it's a little too early to tell. Having said that, what would be the components that would fall into that? The credit market being choppy, the uneasiness, the uncertainty, I think we'll still be continued drivers for people wanting to rent as opposed to owning. There are pockets where we are seeing improvements, particularly, with power. We talked about, and we've talked about this privately with a lot of you, about the frac-ing industry and how that is exploded. And so there's going to be opportunities like that to continue. We also are penetrating new markets. I mean, the industrial market's a growth opportunity for us. And we continue to see a lot of runway there. So yes, I think next year, it's always a possibility. As I stated in my release and on the opening comments of the call, we clearly see that we're marching towards the $1 billion of EBITDA and improved margins. So we'll have to stay tuned.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I guess on Venetor and accretion with regard on the impact of dilution in this quarter on the incremental EBITDA margin. Basically since you took that guidance down by that 3 percentage points, should we expect that, that maybe conservative as I would guess that integrates over the second half and maybe what we saw in the second quarter improves? Am I thinking about that the right way?", "William Plummer", "Well, we certainly will love to take more synergies out of Venetor and GulfStar as we proceed with the integration and to the extent that we do that, it could be better than the full year guidance. The full year result could be better than the guidance range that we've given. If you look within the quarters, it's a harder thing to judge, right? I think we've said before, flow-through will vary from quarter-to-quarter, and so it's harder to say what the impact of Venetor or GulfStar might be on flow-through overall in the third quarter. As we sit here today, flow-through in the third quarter could be a touch lower again than the range that we've given for the full year. It's hard to say because that flow-through calculation is so sensitive. Our year-over-year total revenue increase in the second quarter, for example, was what, $72 million. In order to impact flow-through by a point, that's only $700,000 worth of change in expense. That's not a lot of money. So that's the kind of variation that we're trying to manage through and that's why we're reluctant to give more specific guidance on a quarterly basis on a measure like flow-through. But for the full year, we feel like we've got leverage that we can pull to make it happen at the 62% to 67% range that we're talking about.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay, thanks. Just a couple more. With regard to the second half pricing, someone asked earlier why not upside, actually when we get asked, hey, the comps were easier in the first and I know and we've actually seen it month-over-month building sequentially through the year. Could one of you guys just restress, maybe what would give you the most pause why that could be at risk and then to dispel that?", "William Plummer", "Really, it's just -- I don't know what you put it down to maybe it's nervousness on the part our CFO but these are pretty heady rate moves and it's hard to write down on a piece of paper that I expect to see year-over-year rate increases at 7-plus percent like we have in the month of June. So I'll take a little bit of the heat for maybe not being able as aggressive on rate as some other people could be but it's something that we're being very conscious of. The other thing I'd point out is that we want to make sure that the rate that we realized out of the market is supported by the services that we offer to our clients, it's supported by the fleet we have available for them and it's supported by the whole strategy behind operation United. And as we get assurance on our ability to serve, we have no hesitation about pushing rate. We just want to make sure we're doing it in the context of our strategy.", "Michael Kneeland", "Scott, I'll also say that you got probably in contacts, you go back to the beginning of the year, we're the ones who basically said 5%, at least 5% this year and we stuck our neck out to do that. And the team has delivered on that and we're not done. If we can get more, you can bank on it that we're going to go out and find it. So we'll continue to focus, and rate is the biggest driver of profitability in our industry.", "Operator", "Thank you. And due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, thanks, operator. I just want to -- I'll just wrap up this call by saying thank you for joining us today but more importantly, I wanted you to take a look at the bigger picture. The way I look at it, that was a strong quarter. We had time utilization up, 3.6 percentage points at fifth consecutive quarter. We have rates up 6.1%, with the fleet on average up 8% for the quarter. And on top of all that, we had margin expansion of 3 points. I clearly see how this company is transforming itself. And we're not done, we have more work to do. And I look forward to talking to all of you on our third quarter call. So thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the company\u2019s press release, comments made on today\u2019s call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond its control and consequently actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks operator and good afternoon, everyone and welcome. With me today, as the operator mentioned, is our CFO, Bill Plummer and other members of our senior management team.", "I\u2019m going to start out with a quick recap of our fourth quarter results, which as you know, gave us a strong end to a very good year. And then we\u2019ll look forward to 2012. This is obviously an important year for us.", "We have the RSC deal on the table and we also have a strong outlook as a stand-alone company. So, I want to focus on the fourth quarter metrics that serve as potential indicators for our operating environment in 2012.", "For the fourth quarter, we reported rental revenue up nearly 19% compared to last year; rates up 6.7% on higher volume of equipment on rent; and time utilization of more than 70%, which is a fourth-quarter record for us, once again.", "Now all of this contributed to an adjusted EBITDA that was significantly higher at $281 million, an increase of 55% over the fourth quarter last year. All these metrics tell a very compelling story about our ability to exceed the expectations created by our operating environment.", "We know from the Department of Commerce that spending on non-residential construction declined slightly year-over-year in October and was basically flat in November. And yet, we were able to drive our revenues and rates higher and our time utilization went up on a larger fleet.", "So here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. First, despite the external reports, our sales force is finding that customers are more active and optimistic than a year ago. Our own survey confirms this. So we think there is an early upswing that\u2019s not fully reflected yet in the government data.", "Second, as we mentioned before, there is a secular shift towards renting and just this week several industry reports came out that support this. So there\u2019s no question that the recession is encouraging customers to rely more on rental and less on capital purchases. And once they make that shift, they saw that it could enhance their balance sheet and liquidity. And we believe that this is the most rapid penetration our industry has seen in a long time and we expect most of it to stick as the conditions improve.", "And third, we think that we\u2019re getting a bigger share of pie. Changes in share can be difficult to measure our industry because it\u2019s so fragmented and largely private. But clearly, our segmentation strategy and customer service initiatives are working. And you can see it in our fourth quarter numbers. We had 21% growth in rental revenues from key accounts compared to last year, including 22% growth in National Accounts.", "Key accounts were 55% of rental revenues in the quarter and National Accounts was 35%.", "And rental revenues from industrial were up almost 20% year-over-year and if we remove the impact of acquisitions, industrial was up still a solid 17%. And we are at a point in the cycle where the better run, well-capitalized rental companies can outperform both the environment and the industry as a whole. And we expect to turn another good performance in the first quarter.", "While it\u2019s all very positive, it\u2019s still a tricky cycle and we know that and we are managing the business very closely. But it\u2019s encouraging that we are getting the push in several areas. At the macro level, the leading forecasters predict a rebound in non-res construction of just over 2% on average in 2012 and about 6% in 2013. And this is supported by the architectural billing index, which came in above 50 for every month in the fourth quarter in our sweet spot the Commercial and Industrial sectors.", "Now, if you compare that to the report from Global Insight, which you all know is the industry\u2019s leading forecasting firm. They expect our industry to grow about 5% this year with the majority of those revenues coming from rentals. So, demand for equipment rental services is forecast to outpace construction spending in 2012, just as it did this year. And once again, we are prepared to capture a good part of that growth.", "Another encouraging sign is the fact that all of our regions continue to show year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. In fact, all of our regions saw double-digit growth with the exception of the Southeast and that was partly due to the capital decisions that we made.", "We are also dealing with a bumpy demand both geographically and month-to-month. So our branches are doing an impressive job of implementing our strategy and driving results. Part of that strategy as you know is to constantly manage the productivity of our footprint against changes in the marketplace. We consolidated 28 branches in the year, 18 of them in the fourth quarter. We also acquired 16 branches and opened six as cold starts.", "So, there\u2019s very little change in our branch count from January to December, but we made some important strategic shifts. Of the 16 branches we acquired in 2011, six of them have a strong industrial base. And of the cold starts, half were specially rental branches, meaning trench safety, power and HVAC.", "Our specialty operations are growing at a fast pace with segment revenue up 45% in the fourth quarter. And we benefited from the energy boom and recovery efforts from natural disasters, but there is also an underlying trend toward more demand for power and climate control equipment. And we are also selling, cross-selling our fleet more effectively than ever before. So, specialty rentals are more than a niche for us, it\u2019s an important part of our growth strategy and you\u2019ll see us make further investments in this segment as time goes on.", "Given the way we entered 2012 in high gear, we\u2019re very comfortable with the outlook we\u2019ve issued last night. Our expectations for 2012 are grounded in a solid and achievable plan Bill will discuss in a few minutes. But I want to call your attention to one number that is particularly indicative of our strength as a standalone company. Now, we\u2019re looking at gross rental CapEx of approximately $1 billion this year. Now I know that\u2019s a big number and we are not going to turn away business that is profitable and strategically sound. The fact is demand is there and our rates are still improving.", "We drove more than six points of rate achievement in 2011 and as we said last night, we\u2019re projecting another five points this year. We are not a commodity; we deliver value in areas that matter most to our customers. And we\u2019re very focused on communicating that message as a basis for rates.", "Now if the economy turns against us, we have the flexibility to adjust our CapEx and accelerate new sales. And we\u2019re becoming a much more disciplined company in that regard. And we will always continue to focus intently on customer service as to a way to achieve our targets.", "Now, I should mention that the forecast excludes any impact from the RSC transaction and we will revise that after the deal closes.", "So let\u2019s talk about the RSC deal. I know the announcement created a lot of buzz and rightly so. It\u2019s tremendously exciting. But I don\u2019t want it to overshadow what this company has accomplished and continues to accomplish as we march forward with our strategy. Yes, we\u2019re addressing the needs of the RSC transaction, but we\u2019re also continuing to think about new ways to serve the customers in the field.", "Now for me, that\u2019s one of the things that makes this merger so exciting. United Rentals and RSC are both extremely well run companies and we\u2019re seeking to integrate the best of both companies into one incredible organization. Now just last week, Eric and I kicked off our first all-hands meeting in Houston, Texas. We had a total of about 60 people there representing everything from operations and IT to sales and maintenance.", "Both companies came away from that meeting feeling very good about how closely our cultures are aligned. Now, I\u2019ve been involved in countless integrations for United Rentals both before and after becoming CEO. In fact, I came to this company through an acquisition myself. So, I\u2019ve developed a pretty good instinct for the planning process and the process with RSC is going well. And it\u2019s going to be as seamless as possible for everyone involved.", "So when we get to Q&A, I\u2019m going to ask you to please respect the fact that we are limited in what we can share with you about the deal at this point. So as you know, we filed a preliminary registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC on January 17 and we understand that they\u2019ll have comments and we\u2019re prepared to address them. The forecasts in the S-4 reflect our view of how we would perform as a standalone company. And we\u2019re still comfortable with our estimate, as we discussed in December, that we should get about $200 million \u2013 in fact at least $200 million in cost synergies from combining the two companies.", "With the Hart-Scott-Rodino, the 30-day waiting period, expired on January 20. So that\u2019s a major step forward in the process. And we did receive some requests for more information from the Canadian Competition Bureau, so the waiting period for Canada will be extended until 30 days from the date when all the requested information has been provided. So, as you can see, things are moving along and at this point we expect it to close in the first half of this year.", "That\u2019s about it for updates. So let\u2019s use the Q&A for the best of our advantage this morning. In a lot of ways, we have a straightforward message for you today. We just came off a terrific year, and now we\u2019re entering into what will be a landmark year where we believe that we can excel both as a standalone company and in combination with RSC operations.", "When we set a goal for this company, we pursue it, and we achieve it, and that\u2019s a matter of record. And now we\u2019re looking at bridging to well over $1 billion of EBITDA in 2012 at about 40% margin. And that\u2019s a source of pride for our employees and our leadership team. This company delivers on its promises. 2012 for us is not just about the deals that we can make or forecasts that are out there; it\u2019s about what we can deliver. So with that, I\u2019m going to ask Bill to review the numbers and then we\u2019ll come back and take your questions. So, over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone. Just to stay focused on the key points here, I\u2019m going to be very brief on the quarters \u2013 the quarter and full year numbers. You\u2019ve all seen those. I\u2019ll spend a little bit more time on the outlook, and then we will move to Q&A.", "And I\u2019ll just reiterate some of Mike\u2019s comments to start out. It was a very strong year, a very strong quarter for us finishing up 2011. On rental revenues, that 18.5% year-over-year increase in rental revenue for the quarter was driven by a very nice progression in rate and volume in the quarter with rates being up, as Mike said, 6.7% year-over-year. Rates in the quarter were up 1.4% sequentially compared to the third quarter, which is a very nice progression in that part of the year seasonally. So, nice progression on rates in the quarter.", "On the volume front, OEC on rent during the quarter was up 15.1% over the prior year, and it took us to a total dollar amount of OEC on rent of right around $3 billion. That\u2019s the second highest quarter ever in the Company\u2019s history of fleet that we had on rent, and it\u2019s second only to the third quarter in 2011.", "Time utilization in the quarter was up 1.5 percentage points at 70.8% in Q4. And that represents the seventh consecutive quarter of record time utilization over the last seven quarters. So, just tremendous momentum on the time utilization front to go along with very nice rate progression as well.", "When you look at the full year last year, just real briefly, rate \u2013 Mike mentioned that rates up 6.1% came in right at \u2013 maybe a touch better than what we had guided to after the third quarter. And that set us up very nicely for 2012 as well. With rates at that level, we have a carryover benefit in 2012 full year of about 3%, so a nice starting point for 2012.", "For the full year time utilization was up 350 basis points, 3.5 percentage points to 69.1%, and that\u2019s another company record for the full year. So all-in-all, the rental story was very strong just across the board. It feels like we\u2019re firing on all cylinders. I get nervous when I say that, but it feels pretty good going into 2012.", "The other part \u2013 significant part of the revenue story in the quarter was used equipment sales. We sold $93 million in proceeds of used equipment in the quarter. That\u2019s up from $40 million in the prior year. And that generated a pretty significant full year used sales proceeds number of $208 million, up from $144 million in the prior year. The especially good news though was that gross margins finished the year fairly strong for us both for the quarter and the full year. Just looking at the full year, our margin was 31.7 percentage points, and that\u2019s up 320 basis points compared to the prior year, and it\u2019s our strongest full year margin ever.", "So, the used equipment story is very important to us because it\u2019s a vital part of how we\u2019re managing the fleet going forward. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of use that we need to continue to focus on in 2012 and in future years. So we\u2019re going to spend a lot of time thinking about the channel mix and in particular how do we enhance our retail sales contribution in our used sales. So we\u2019ll be talking about that more as the year unfolds.", "On the profitability front, again, a very strong quarter, adjusted EBITDA came in at $281 million for the quarter. That\u2019s an improvement of $100 million or 55% compared to the prior year. And in fact, the fourth quarter EBITDA was basically flat with the third quarter EBITDA which, as you all know, is historically our highest seasonal quarter during the course of the year. Obviously, fourth quarter was enhanced by the used sales strength that we had as well as the $8 million self-insurance benefit that we had in the quarter; still a very, very strong performance for the quarter on adjusted EBITDA. Margin for the quarter came in at 37.7% and that\u2019s an increase of 740 basis points over the prior year.", "So, when you look at the full year, we had a very nice result. The full year adjusted EBITDA of $929 million, that\u2019s a 34% increase. And the full year margin came in at 35.6%, and that\u2019s a 470 basis point increase over the prior year, and indeed it\u2019s a full year record for the company on EBITDA margin.", "Flow-through was very robust. We had flow-through for the quarter of 67.1%, and that put us at 63.6% for the full year, well within the range that we\u2019ve been guiding you to of 62% to 67% for the full year. So, a nice result on the flow-through front as well.", "And for those who like EPS, we had a very nice adjusted EPS result, $0.82 on the year. Obviously had some puts and takes, including the self-insurance reserve benefit of $8 million. But that was offset by a higher than expected tax rate. So, when we look at that $0.82, we think that\u2019s a good reflection of the strength of profitability that we delivered throughout the course of the fourth quarter.", "Just a couple of key points on fleet management and free cash flow, we had promised $775 million of gross capital spend at our last outlook; we delivered $774 million. Combine that with the $208 million of full year used proceeds, that gives you a $566 million net rental investment in the Company for 2011.", "And that spend, as we\u2019ve said again and again, was driven by us responding to what we\u2019re seeing from the market. So, it\u2019s very encouraging that we\u2019re able to put that much investment into the Company based on very strong demand. Certainly, time utilization for the year shows you that we\u2019re able to make the investment and still put the equipment on rent. So, very encouraged by that coming in to 2012.", "On free cash flow, we finished the year stronger than even we expected. Free cash flow was $23 million for the full year, and that was really helped significantly both by the used sales effort at the end of the year but more importantly by collections which were very strong late in the year.", "So those are the key points I wanted to make about Q4 and full year 2011. Let me spend just a few minutes on our 2012 standalone outlook. And again, it\u2019s standalone, not giving any effect for the transaction.", "As Mike mentioned this outlook is fully consistent with the forecast that we put in the S-4 for 2012. So, if there is any question on anybody\u2019s mind about the difference between what we\u2019re seeing now and what was in the S-4, there is none.", "On the revenue front, you saw in the press release that we expect rates to be up about 5%. And as I mentioned already, we\u2019re starting with a carryover benefit of about 3%. So, we think that we\u2019ve got a good foundation for delivering that 5% going through the year. And obviously, as we have for the last couple of years, as the opportunity presents itself to take more, we will drive more in rate realization.", "On the time utilization front, we look to improve utilization by another 0.5 point or so for the full year. That would be another record year for us and to do that in the face of spending $1 billion of gross CapEx, we think it would be a very, very nice result on time utilization.", "On the CapEx front, we are going to spend about $1 billion of gross CapEx and the net underneath that will be about $770 million to $820 million, that\u2019s the range that we\u2019re calling for. If we do that, we will drive up the average fleet size for the full year by $0.5 billion. The spend is going to be focused the way it has been for the last couple of years. We\u2019re going to respond to key customer needs and we\u2019re going to help to drive the fleet mix that we\u2019ve been driving and so we expect to continue to shift the fleet through our spend.", "Spending $1 billion gross and selling what we expect to sell will have the impact of also reducing the age of our fleet. It should come down about 2.5 months over the course of 2012 on that plan.", "Free cash flow for the year will be a use of free cash of anywhere from $50 million to $100 million. And on the profitability front, we think the flow-through that we\u2019ll realize in 2012 will be very comparable to what we realized in 2011. So, we are calling it mid-60s \u2013 for a range, we would say the same range that we gave you for 2011 between 62% and 67% adjusted EBITDA flow-through to total revenue.", "Obviously, there will be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as you saw in 2011 on that flow-through. And we will certainly keep you up-to-date as we go through the year.", "And finally, just to offer a couple brief thoughts on the first quarter of 2012 as you can gather from our comments, we\u2019ve got a very nice start on rate and time utilization so far through January in the first quarter. So, we expect the quarter to develop nicely for us.", "There will be the normal seasonality. We haven\u2019t repealed the seasons not just yet. So, on the revenue front, we will see sort of a typical kind of decline due to seasonality and profitability will also show a typical type of decline due to seasonality maybe somewhat muted as we drive better utilization, put more fleet into the business and continue to realize price.", "But all in all, the momentum is good. Things feel like they are headed in the right direction. And we are very encouraged by the way the year is kicking off.", "So with that, I will end my comments and ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Henry Kirn of UBS. Your line is open.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Good morning, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good afternoon, actually. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "It\u2019s morning somewhere, here.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "It\u2019s been a long day. Last year, there was some volatility and incremental flow-through as we went from fourth quarter to first quarter and then throughout the year. Can you talk about your expectations for incrementals as we progress in 2012?", "William Plummer", "Sure. I mean as I said, we expect volatility in each quarter. It\u2019s a very sensitive calculation, so that\u2019s going to happen. We feel good about the way things will develop as we get into the more busy season, second and third quarter in particular. First quarter, the flow-through, you\u2019ve got to have some below the average in order to get the average if \u2013 somewhere above the average and first quarter is always a challenge on that front for us. So, I\u2019d say you probably could see flow-through a little bit lower than the range in the first quarter and then improving as we go through the year.", "Keep in mind, the flow-through is going to respond to things like how much you sell and you use equipment in a given quarter relative to the rental revenue that you generate. That\u2019s a challenge in the first quarter. It will respond to things like the acquisitions that you do, right, when they came in last year and how that quarter comps with the quarter that you\u2019re in this year. That can be a little bit of a drag in the first quarter given that we\u2019ve started to add the acquisitions later on in the year.", "So, those are the kinds of things that will flow through the flow-through calculation, if you will. And we\u2019ll point them out as we go through the year.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "I\u2019ll respect that one question limit and pass the baton. Congratulations.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks.", "William Plummer", "Well, thanks. Thanks, Henry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Chang of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a strong year and another strong quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just a quick question on the forecast. I mean you pretty much went through your 2012 expectations, but for the S-4, you also have 2013 through 2015 in there. And I was curious as to kind of what your macro assumptions were and what contribution you were expecting from higher pricing for those three years.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I\u2019ll give you what the macro environment and Bill can go into some of the other details. But the macro environment, as we have worked with all of the outside services that are \u2013 the IHS Global Insight and Moody\u2019s, Economy, McGraw-Hill, all the typical names that you would play out; the consensus is starting in 2012, it\u2019s up about 2.1%. Then in 2013, it goes to 6%.", "And then, we also are working with the Global Insight, which as I stated in my opening comments, has been working very closely with the American Rental Association projecting what the growth patterns will be over the following years. So, those are the macro environments that we\u2019re working with. Keep in mind, we also tie that by talking to our customers and we will do that and continue to update as we go year-to-year. But I would say that that was probably the biggest macro environment that we were looking at.", "William Plummer", "And in terms of other aspects of those forecasts, I mean we certainly used our usual thought about what the value of incremental rental rate is. So, it will drop through at something like 97%, 98% for rental rate improvement. But we also thought carefully about the fleet additions that we would make over that timeframe and the impact of additional fleet to profitability, how we might drive time utilization across that timeframe and what that means to us; really all aspects of our business. And starting from that macro backdrop, we put in what we thought were very attainable goals for the next several years, we\u2019re not trying to dilute ourselves, we just wanted to tell the story that we thought was as close to accurate as we could and those are the numbers that came out.", "Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just a quick clarification, is it fair to say that starting in 2013, we are expecting I guess kind of like a decel to a low single-digit to flattish rental rate environment as the years go forward?", "William Plummer", "I\u2019m sorry, starting in 2012 you said?", "Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "2013.", "William Plummer", "2013. Yeah, the way we thought about rate over that time period was 5% in 2012, and then we trended it down to low single digits over the next couple of years. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we trended down from the 5% we assumed in 2012, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "Peter Chang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "All right. Well, thanks for taking my questions, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yep. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Raso of ISI. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, David.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI", "Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Quick question about the S-4 progression on the EBITDA margins, again we\u2019re \u2013 excuse me, talking standalone company. The improvement that you see is obviously a little more significant 2011, 2012, but even from then on still getting a couple of hundred basis points. And I know there\u2019s a lot that can go into that beyond just the rental margin itself.", "But how are you thinking about looking out a couple of years, the rental margin ex-depreciation, right? I mean, it used to \u2013 you know, high watermarks used to be 55, go back in the day maybe a little higher. But we\u2019re already at a pretty high level coming out of 2011. So, again, on a standalone basis, what are the things when it comes to the mix, the kind of accounts you\u2019re taking, how should we think about your target for the rental margin? Because the other things have a lot issues around your capital decisions, right? Some buying a lot of new, you can sell out a used, and so forth, but truly the core kind of business, the rental margin ex depreciation.", "William Plummer", "Yeah, David. I think rather than sort of talk about specific rental margins, I\u2019d just point to a couple of key aspects of our business that I know you know. We\u2019re putting fleet into our business in a fairly significant way over that period. And that\u2019s a very powerful lever for improving margins for us. So the amount of fleet that we\u2019re adding over the horizon is hugely important. That\u2019s point number one.", "Point number two is that, what we just said with Peter, the rate assumption, while it does trend down over the next several years, we\u2019re still realizing rate improvement which as you know is a hugely powerful lever and generating better margin as well. So I think those are two very prominent aspects of how the margins of the business, overall rental included, will trend. And we feel comfortable that we can deliver that if the market demand is there to support that additional fleet. We believe it will be based on the macro backdrop that Michael just talked about. And so that\u2019s why we put together the forecast the way we did.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah, David, we\u2019re also trying to drive some efficiencies in the business. As you know, we\u2019ve kicked off fast. We\u2019ve got by the end \u2013 midyear this year, we\u2019ll have all of our locations up on that. We do believe that, using technology to further drive efficiencies, we\u2019ll be able to realize in the out-years.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI", "Okay, I appreciate it. I was just \u2013 the S-4, you\u2019re already above 40% for 2013, next year, and then in the north of 43% in 2014. So I was curious, obviously the new machine gets it on the depreciation line, your maintenance goes down with the new machines. So I could see why the new machines obviously create a better rental margin. I was just curious if you had any color around how you thought about the mix of business, maybe deemphasizing aerials in the fleet. Just trying to think about cycle to cycle, the configuration of the accounts and the fleet size and the type of fleet might be a subtlety on why the margins can be better at the rental level cycle to cycle. I was just trying to flesh out some of those items that might show a difference between the companies cycle to cycle?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. I think our general assumption is that we can continue maybe at a somewhat slower rate, but continue to trend in the customer mix that we\u2019ve established, growing with the larger players who we believe offer us a better profit opportunity. So we continue to trend in that direction, continue to trend more toward industrial in that mix of customers.", "As for the fleet, again, we\u2019ve been very consistent in saying that we\u2019re going to continue to trend to a slightly smaller aerial share of the overall fleet and grow in some of the other areas. Some of those other areas are the specialty businesses like trench and power and HVAC. So, those will contribute very nicely as we go forward. So I think those are the things that I would call out as part of that longer-range forecast that we believe supports the margin trends that you see there.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI", "No, I appreciate that. I mean there is a difference between saying we\u2019re just going to run the company more efficiently, which hopefully you will, it\u2019s a higher hurdle rate to jump over than simply \u2013 the mix, it\u2019s just more advantageous to have a higher rental margin, thus the idea of doing a 40%-plus EBITDA margin or a higher rental margin in the last cycle is \u2013 it\u2019s not quite as high a hurdle rate in the investors\u2019 mind, so. Okay. No, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "William Plummer", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital", "A question for you on the competitive environment. One, can you maybe just comment on the health of some of your independent regional peers? And two, because I think most of them are also fully utilized, do you think that 2012 could actually be a better year for you in terms of share gains?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, Joe, this is Mike. We have our plans. We laid it out. We\u2019ve \u2013 as Bill was saying, we put a lot of \u2013 set of assumptions. Could it always be better? Yeah. It could be. When you look at the landscape, as I mentioned, the well-funded, the larger companies I think will outperform the industry as a whole. And you are right; I think time utilization has kicked up for everybody. But I think that the credit market is still restricting a lot of growth and that bodes well for the larger organizations.", "So is there an opportunity? Yes. Our strategy is to focus on profitable growth and be selective of the customers that we\u2019re going to choose, and also expanding our trench, power, HVAC side. So, yes, the answer is, could it be? Yes.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital", "Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll hope back in queue.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I apologize in advance, just out of habit I\u2019m going to have a multi-part question. But, with \u2013 Bill, mostly for you, with regard to CapEx, could you discuss timing throughout the year since it\u2019s such a large number this year; implications of how the RRR transaction might make you rethink that, and then just a reminder of your supplier commitment and rates that you have locked in with them? Thanks for the run-on.", "William Plummer", "Sure. So on the timing of CapEx, we\u2019ve talked about looking at the year, and 2012 is a year of two halves, with the first half being fairly hefty amount of spend. We\u2019ve talked about something like $600 million of the $1 billion would be spent in the first two quarters of the year. That\u2019s our thinking as we sit and speak right now.", "And based on the commitments that we\u2019ve gotten from the vendors, and indeed based on the receipts that we\u2019ve had so far in the month of January, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any issue with getting that much fleet delivered in the first half. So that\u2019s the first half; the second half would be the remainder.", "And as we said, though, we\u2019re going to evaluate how the market develops to make sure that it warrants spending that second half roughly $400 million or so. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the timing.", "As to the impact of the transaction, we \u2013 it\u2019s really too soon to say the specific amount of impact on the transaction. We are going to evaluate what their capital plan is, what our capital plan is and where there might be opportunities to realize some benefit managing the two as one. My guess sitting here right now is that there will be some impact, but it\u2019s going to be pretty small in 2012 is my guess. And that\u2019s the way we modeled it as we modeled the acquisition to set the valuation. So I would say pretty small impact to the overall spend in 2012.", "As to the suppliers, I\u2019m sorry, Scott, I\u2019ve forgotten, what was your question around the suppliers?", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Just negotiated rate going into the year with the suppliers.", "William Plummer", "So, we\u2019ve been very focused on mitigating the impact of inflation, as we always are. If you exclude the Tier 4 purchases that we do, the rest of our purchasing will come in in the low single-digits in terms of inflation over last year. The Tier 4 units, depending on the manufacturer, will cost more. There\u2019s just no avoiding it. That\u2019s partly though why we wanted to try and pre-buy a significant amount of our fleet this year as well. We were able to place orders that take advantage of run-on production under the old Tier 3 rules, and so that has helped mitigate any impact of our capital spend \u2013 of inflation on our capital spend. So ex-Tier 4 in the low single-digits inflation, very low single-digits I would say. Does that help?", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Yeah. Great. Thanks and congratulations.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Emily Shanks with Barclays Capital.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Emily.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi. How are you, guys?", "Michael Kneeland", "Very well.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good. Congrats on a great quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "My one question is just around the 4Q rate coming in better than your forecast and your thoughts around that. I\u2019m specifically curious if there\u2019s anything of note going on on the competitive front and/or is it just simply demand, and with that secondarily if you could comment if you are seeing any improvement from some of your competitors? I know it seemed as though they had fallen off in the summertime.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah, Emily. This is Michael. My sense would be is, we are the first to report and if you look at historically what you have been hearing from all of my competitors who are public; they have all publicly have come out with improvement on rates, so my sense is that that trend will continue.", "I have said this before, and I will say it again, rates is a powerful lever within our industry. And if you look over the last several years, all of our rates came down quite a lot. And the fundamentals of getting over your cost of capital hasn\u2019t changed and so my sense is given the high time utilization, given the fact that the Tier 4 engines and Tier 4 products are going to cost more, it\u2019s going to behoove all of us to make sure that we get the right return on all of our assets.", "So my sense will be given what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, it should continue. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see but, again, my sense would be is, as you hear other companies come out publicly I would not be surprised to see their rates up as well.", "Emily Shanks \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Pease go ahead.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Hey. Thanks, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "How are you doing?", "Michael Kneeland", "Good.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Congratulations on another great quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "I just wanted to tag on to David\u2019s question, and take it one step further and go in the direction of returns. And I know one of the big things you guys have really tired to emphasize is \u2013 is improving the full cycle returns on invested capital.", "William Plummer", "Hey, Ted. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m having a hard time hearing you. Can you get a little closer to the phone?", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Sure. Is that any better?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. That is.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Oh, great. Sorry about that. So what I was hoping to do was talk a little bit more about your returns on a go-forward basis. And I know one of the big internal pushes has been to improve the full cycle returns. And so, given the inflection that we\u2019ve seen in the business, I\u2019m just wondering if you can update us on how you think about returns over this upcoming cycle, both on a standalone basis and to the degree you can talk at all about the pro forma that would be great as well?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m rapidly scanning my brain trying to think about how to talk about the returns and not be flippant and say something like returns are going to go up. We\u2019re certainly focused on the elements of return. And we certainly, over the forecast horizon that we put in the S-4, improve our returns. They\u2019re going to come out of the usual suspects, right, improving rate, being more efficient with the cost side of the P&L, leveraging your fixed costs in particular over a larger fleet. We think we get better profit improvement than the increased average size of the fleet in the forecast horizon that we\u2019ve put out there. So \u2013 maybe if you ask a more specific question, but overall we think that there is a very nicely trending path of returns over the next several years and it\u2019s just up to us to go out and get the elements that lead to that trend in returns.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Asked maybe differently, could you speak to specific numbers about your targeted returns on invested capital, maybe that will be implied by the forecast you had in the S-4 and what that might mean cycle-over-cycle, will the average return would be for the company?", "William Plummer", "Yeah. No, I wouldn\u2019t comment on a specific targeted return that\u2019s in the S-4 forecast. Maybe I\u2019d just drop back to say that we\u2019re very firmly committed to the idea of delivering cost of capital returns over the cycle. And we think about our cost of capital as being something like 10% as a target. So I\u2019ll stop there without getting more specific, but we feel good about the trend that we have toward that goal of delivering cost of capital returns over the cycle.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay. That\u2019s great. Well, congrats again, and best of luck this year guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. Thanks, Ted.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Ted.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, Seth.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Afternoon.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC", "Kind of conceptually, I just want to throw something out there. I mean as the commercial construction cycle gets better, would you expect the \u2013 your construction bucket to outgrow your industrial bucket going forward, just have a faster growth? And then, what would the implications for margin be? I know you\u2019ve talked about I think industrial margins being actually higher, fewer transactions, what have you, so can you just \u2013 maybe as the market get \u2013 as the cycle gets better, how we should be thinking about that?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah. Seth, basically what we\u2019ve been saying is we\u2019re looking to diversify our portfolio. And to your point, around industrial, the dynamics around industrials are typically larger. They rent longer. They have the equipment out for longer periods of time. Those same dynamics you could fit into the larger national accounts spread across North America. So, we said we wanted to expand our portfolio to be somewhere in the 30% to 40% range of industrial. And I mentioned on the December call that this transaction with RSC gets us to where we want to be.", "And I think that when you \u2013 we look at industrial, industrial recovers first, and it\u2019s less cyclical. We can park 2009 for a moment because it affected almost anything and everything that was moving. But in a typical cycle, it\u2019s more resilient. But in a recovery, as you can imagine, production goes up and industry goes up, first, and then you see construction kind of lag behind it. And, my sense is you\u2019re going to see that again here. So, when I look at it, we want to make sure that we have a blend, but it\u2019s more the type of customer that we are focusing at inside of construction that I think is the difference today versus yesteryear.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC", "Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, okay. So even though the construction \u2013 commercial construction is getting \u2013 accelerating, the customer profile is different than it used to be?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC", "Okay. And then I guess just \u2013 on the acquisition front, does the RSC transaction preclude you from doing other deals in your mind? I mean, you\u2019ve had some good success picking off some of these specialty operators. Do you think you\u2019ll continue to do that? Or just get too distracted with the RSC deal?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, let me just say this, that we\u2019re razor-focused on the RSC deal and getting that done and completing that. Having said that, as I said, we\u2019ll continue to look at the opportunities that do exist in our specialty business. We see that as a unique opportunity for growth. And more importantly, there\u2019s a connection of cross-selling between our current customer base and those lines of business. So, we will be cognizant of what\u2019s available out there, but we\u2019ll also look at it from a cold start and also from a capital allocation for assets. So, it\u2019s all the above on our specialty, but clearly I want to make a point that we are focused around the integration process of RSC and United Rentals.", "William Plummer", "Yeah, just if I could; that \u2013 the integration process will certainly be a major focus, but we want to make sure that we\u2019re seeing opportunities and put those opportunities in the context of everything that we\u2019ve got going on. So, integration and, as Mike mentioned, our capital structure and how we allocate capital. That won\u2019t be lost on us and we\u2019re going to be very protective of the capital structure to make sure that we do good work on the capital structure over the early part following the acquisition of RSC.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC", "Got it. Thanks very much, guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Wells with Thompson Research. Please go ahead.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, David.", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. So, my question is if I look at the industry data flow out of the company, you had your survey results from August and September that were positive, and then we\u2019ve had a really nice run of positive weather here. And, what I\u2019m trying to get at is: we\u2019ve got some signs that the market is looking good.", "But, my sense is what\u2019s the risk that that\u2019s a head fake to some extent, and another year where the macroeconomists come out and talk about a recovery in construction, and we had the same thing happen last year and it didn\u2019t really happen in 2011. So maybe could you steer us to what\u2019s giving visibility to really make the big wager on CapEx that you\u2019ve made in the first half and maybe even any data points here over the last, say, six to eight weeks that give you the confidence and visibility to put the big roll of the dice, so to speak?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I look at it \u2013 it\u2019s a little more scientific than rolling the dice. But, as we went through the year, our time utilization consistently quarter-over-quarter was at record levels. And, as Bill mentioned, we are seeing that play out going into this year as well. But, when we talk \u2013 it\u2019s about our customers and the way in which we go to market and we\u2019re focused with our customers and we\u2019re more connected with them than we ever have in the past. And, again, they\u2019re more optimistic. It\u2019s the work that they have in front of them.", "And, we also take a look at where the opportunities existed, but because of our process and the way in which we planned last year, we could have grown. We\u2019ve been mentioning quarter over quarter and \u2013 with investors that we could have spent a lot more money last year, but we were very disciplined, and we wanted to achieve certain hurdles which we have overcome.", "As a result of that, even if the market were to play out at flat, forget the 2% for a moment, take a look at this past year. The market declined, and we had significant double-digit growth. I think it still plays out that the uncertainty in the marketplace, coupled with the capital \u2013 or the credit market tightness still \u2013 the secular shift toward renting is continuing that momentum. So, we have something else at play here than just the macro environment.", "William Plummer", "Can I just add one thought? Maybe it\u2019s a little too granular; but one of the things that gives me comfort is not only to hear our customers say how encouraged they are about this year and the next few, but then to dive deeper into some of our tools like our job board and actually look at the projects that those customers are on, right?", "And, you look at XYZ customer is on an airport expansion; well that\u2019s going to run for a couple of few years. Another customer is on a new power plant construction project; that\u2019s going to run for a while. Here\u2019s a hospital over here; here\u2019s a school expansion over there. So when you scratch the projects that folks are working on, it just feels like there\u2019s something real and substantial underneath. The overall tone that we get is that there\u2019s a solid year coming up. So that\u2019s one of the things that I look at.", "David Wells \u2013 Thompson Research", "Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Yeah, on the RSC acquisition, to the extent you\u2019re comfortable commenting, can you just talk about, if the acquisition is approved, how much upside to your utilization rates should we think about from the RSC Total Control system? And, can you comment on whether you would ultimately expect the revenue share for the trench and HVAC businesses for the combined company to be similar to where you are on a standalone basis today?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah, Jerry, let me just say that, as I mentioned, the integration process is well underway. We just kicked it off. Individuals from both companies are looking at a way to launch the new combined organization.", "But, also at the same time, I want to emphasize that operationally we are two distinct companies until such time that we get all the approval and votes and we close. So, we are conducting ourselves accordingly at all levels. That being said, we do have a team that is dedicated for just what you just talked about and many more. It\u2019s made up of both sides. I will tell you the operating principles that we are working under, I think, are the key takeaways. We are looking at it through the customer\u2019s eyes.", "How do we affect the customer? And, we\u2019re looking at integration of the best of both worlds. And, there is a lot of things that RSC does great and there are some things that we do as well. So, the question is, how can we get both of those married up and put together and that\u2019s what these teams are focused on. Bill talked about and I mentioned about following the money and making sure that we deliver on at least that $200 million. But, then the last one is communication and we have to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to communicate as we come through and find these answers. But, it\u2019s too early. We just kicked it off but you just mentioned the one thing that they have that quite honestly is a valuable asset to them. We just don\u2019t know yet at this point.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about fleet age in this cycle compared to the last cycle for your stand-alone business? I appreciate it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s more of a byproduct of your capital allocation decision than a target in and of itself but I would appreciate your broader thoughts if you don\u2019t mind.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, sure. And, I\u2019m going to ask Bill to chime in as well. But, what we have experienced during this downturn is our ability to actually achieve record time utilization while improving our rental rates on the older fleet. And so, we\u2019ve pressure tested our theory, and we seem to be able to operate a lot \u2013 just fine at record levels on the older fleets. So, I think we will probably do some reevaluation to better understand that. As Bill mentioned, with the capital that we\u2019re spending, we will drop our fleet age down over time and starting this year. But, to say what is the optimum area, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we still have to refine that because, like I said, this downturn opened our eyes.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And, at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kneeland. Sir?", "Michael Kneeland", "Okay. Well, thank you, operator. I think this is a good time to wrap up the Q&A. And, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And, also I suggest that you download our latest investor deck that we\u2019ve got posted on our website. It has our full year numbers and also some additional information. And, as always, we welcome your calls to Greenwich and for site visits to our locations to see how we operate. Again, I want to thank everybody, and we look forward to our first quarterly call.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the company\u2019s press release, comments made on today\u2019s call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond its control and consequently actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as well as subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company\u2019s website at www.ur.com.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.", "You should also note that today\u2019s call will include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term. Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer and Matt Flannery, Executive Vice President - Operations and Sales. ", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome. With me today, is our CFO, Bill Plummer, Matt Flannery, our Executive Vice President of Operations and Sales and other members of our senior management team.", "Matt has been leading the integration planning for our merger with RSC and I have asked him to share some details about that process, so I have three speakers this morning. But first I want to spend a few minutes on the quarter and the closing of the transaction. So I\u2019ll start with the results. ", "You saw the numbers we reported last night. We had a very good quarter, we showed 21% growth in rental revenues and realized $231 million of adjusted EBITDA in our slowest seasonal quarter. In fact our performance surpassed all prior first quarters with record time utilization, record fleet growth and record adjusted EBITDA and a record margin. Once again we drove the profitable growth faster than the construction recovery and this time we got some modest help, from the environment. Spending our non-residential construction appears to be running year over year. Now, I have to wait for the March numbers to see of that holds true. ", "And the architecture billing index, which has remained above 50 for the commercial and industrial sector for 7 straight months and this morning the ABI reported that the March index for our sector was 56. So, as you know we felt good about 2012 going into this year and we are just as bullish now and even more confident about our outlook. ", "We put $300 million of gross CapEx into the market in the first three months, because we saw demand and as a result show we didn\u2019t just grow our fleet, we put it on at rent, at good margins.", " ", "Our rates improved more than 6% year-over-year, and time utilization was our first quarter record for us at 62.3%. Now, both of these metrics are in line with our expectations. These results speak volumes about the effectiveness of our strategy and the ongoing secular shift towards renting. ", "We\u2019re managing the business to a new kind of construction cycle, one that benefits from both the upswing in activity and a change in customer behavior. Now, we\u2019re making the right decisions at the top, more important our branch teams and our sales organizations are doing a stellar job of acting on those decisions, by living up to our promise of exceptional customer service, as the heart of our value proposition and are conducting business more safely than ever. We cut our [ph]reportable rate for more than half in the first quarter, so a lot of credit goes to this field and I commend them for the progress that they are making. ", "Now, as a quick overview, I can tell you that all of our operating regions show double digit rental revenue improvement in the quarter compared to last year. But our strategy doesn\u2019t focus just on the top line. We\u2019re pushing hard for profitable growth, in the Southwest for example where the environment has been challenging over the past two years. We showed 20% rental revenue growth in the quarter. And we also had a 5.7% rate improvement, as well as the strongest utilization improvement of any region, up 7.6 percentage points. ", "In the Gulf, with demand drove rates up 8.6%, our time utilization also improved. Now that being said, some areas are more robust than others. In Eastern Canada, although we are up year-over-year, we don\u2019t expect the same vigorous market conditions that we saw last year. We still anticipate that rental revenue growths will be in the double digits, but it maybe they\u2019re at slower pace. Now, the balance of rates and utilization is top of mind for all of our branches in every sales person. Our people know that when we compete for business, particularly big projects, the revenue dollars could be exiting, if the margins have to be protected. ", "Some sectors overseeing demand are energy, which is stronger than ever and plant construction in the manufacturing sector. Also institutional projects and big urban areas like Montreal and Dallas are seeing growth. And in more rural areas states like Oregon, the construction of datacenters represent a growing opportunity for us. Our specialty business in trench safety, power and HVAC had a very strong quarter with rental revenues up more than 40% year-over-year and an improvement in operating margin. Now some of that comes from our acquisitions in the trailing 9 months, but even excluding acquisitions, we still had over 24% growth in our specialty rentals.  ", "It\u2019s good to see project activity pick up again. And it still has a long way to go but our customers are in a better place than they were a year ago, particularly our target customers. When we look at our key accounts and national accounts as segments of our customer base, the rental revenue growth for each group was higher than the company\u2019s 20% growth overall. ", "And we talk to our customers all the time and are optimistic about this year. And this supports our belief that 2012 will continue to be a year of significant growth for us. Now, very soon we will have a much larger organization, putting momentum behind that growth. And we schedule our special meeting of stockholders for April 27 to approve the RSC merger, and we planned a closer transaction on April 30. Now, immediately after closing on what we call Day 1, we\u2019ll start communicating with all employees of both companies and move immediately into integration mode. The planning process of the past four months has been intense. Every detail has been scrutinized. Am very proud of the way we are handling this work load without taking our eyes off our customers. ", "In a matter of weeks we will begin building on the strengths of each company to form the world\u2019s best equipment rental provider. United Rentals and RSC are both strong companies right now and are going to be even stronger united. And we\u2019ll open the door for greater creation of value for our customers and our investors and that has been our goal all along. And we are very close to acting on those opportunities. ", "So, with that I\u2019m going to ask Matt to spend a few minutes on the integration and then Bill will cover our financial results and after that we\u2019ll take your questions, so over to you Matt.  ", "Matt Flannery", "Great, thanks Mike and good morning everyone. When the senior leadership teams of both RSC and United Rentals got together in early January, we were all ready in complete agreement about what would be our guiding principles for the integration process. These three principles were defined early on, as part of the decision to combine the operations. ", "First, we would do view any and all changes through the eyes of the customer. Any lapse in customer service would be unacceptable. Second, we would be diligent about making sure we created the best in class organization for the new United Rentals. We wanted to make sure we retained the top talent and continued on with the best process for each business function. And third we committed to follow the money and look hard for synergy opportunities along every step of building our new organization. I would like to take a minute to tell you all how we\u2019ve gone about this process.", "When Mike asked me to lead this integration, the first challenge that I confronted was at the most fundamental level. How can we pull together an integration team from both organizations without hurting the base business? Well, as you all read last night, both companies stayed on-track with strong first quarter performances despite the fact that we\u2019ve had over 100 people deeply involved in the integration planning and thousands of others more than little curious about the process.", "We accomplished this through the efforts of our align management as well as productive communication from both (inaudible). From an integration process perspective, we organized our efforts into 14 functional and strategic teams. All focused on a specific area of the business. These teams have a total of 25 sub teams working to assist them. Each team is jointly led by the functional expert from each organization to ensure that the end result incorporates the best thinking of both companies. One example of this would be the go-to market strategy team. They\u2019ve been focused on sales, structure and customer segmentation. As a first step, the senior vice president of sales from each team reviewed the best practices from both companies. Then we had multiple field leaders from both organizations break out into sub teams. Each sub team is charged with focusing on a single component of the sales approach. By having the sub teams drilled down to the most basic customer touch points we\u2019ve been able to be very precise in identifying the challenges and opportunities that employees will face as the new United Rentals.", "All of our field managers will be handed a sales playbook on day one after the close. The playbook will identify what issues may arise and how they should handle them in the field. We\u2019ve compiled similar playbooks for the business functions of operations, human resources as well as for all the corporate departments so that employees can be focused on keeping this a seamless transition for the customer. We want to be sure that everybody is on the same page.", "While these teams are working on building the best process, they also continue to look for potential synergies. In other words follow the money. For the past 12 weeks each team has had weekly meetings to provide updates on the synergy opportunities they found and they would then report them to our Integration Management Office or IMO. The IMO evaluates each opportunity and gives guidance on how each potential decision would affect the business. In other words, is this synergy reasonable to attain. The IMO then reports out to our steering committee for final review every two weeks. We\u2019ve gone through this process methodically since February and we will continue to review opportunities long after this field is closed.", "These efforts have resulted in each team preparing detailed action plan that has not only uncovered synergies in excess of our original estimate of 200 million, but have also helped us to identify best practice. For example, we are in agreement that RSCs total control system is the best way to help our customers manage their equipment usage. And the fast dispatch system used by United Rentals will help the combined organization operate its delivery vehicles in a more cost effective and efficient manner. Another area where we spend much energy is on the people selection process. We\u2019ve said throughout this process that we are focused on building the best team in the industry and I am pleased to report that the leadership teams from both organizations are very well represented. Earlier this month, we announced internally our field leadership team which includes 14 vice presidents heading up our branch network, 7 from RSC and 7 from United Rentals. We\u2019ll also have 4 senior vice presidents working in the field; 2 from RSC and 2 from United. And although having these numbers be identical was never a target. The need signifies the balance that we\u2019ll have in representation from each organization throughout our field network. And before I turn the call over to Bill I would just like to add that there is one thing I have learned in my 20+ years in the business and in the experience that I have gained with multiple acquisitions and to that success will be driven by the ability of the new team to work as a cohesive unit. For the past 4 months, I spend most of my time with the RSC and United Rental\u2019s employees doing just that working side by side getting prepared for this integration. And it is very encouraging to realize that we are much more alike than we are different. I feel confident that this alignment will help immensely in delivering a smooth integration process for our employees and our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Bill for the financial review.", "William Plummer", "Alright, thanks Matt and good morning to everyone. In the spirit of saving more time for Q&A my comments would be briefer than normal and let me start by reminding everyone of the change that we made in some of the key metrics that I\u2019ll be touching on here this morning. Effective, that the beginning of this year we adopted the ARA methodology for calculating certain key metrics, they include rental rates, time utilization, dollar utilization and fleet age. So, all my comments about the metrics here will be on the new ARA basis and year-over-year comparisons will have the prior period adjusted as well. So, let me start with rental revenue as always very strong quarter rental revenue as Mike pointed out. Rental revenues up 20.5% year-over-year and we had strong contributions from both rate and volume in that number Rental rates were up 6.3% for the quarter over the prior year and were on a sequential basis essentially flat, they were down 0.08%, so let\u2019s call that flat for argument sake. So all-in-all the rate environment was solid and fully consistent with what we expected for the early part of the year and indeed fully consistent with the 5% target that we\u2019ve laid out for the full year.", "Volume was also strong. We were up 18% year-over-year in OEC on rent, up to $2.6 billion of OEC on rent, a very strong number for the first quarter. It obviously reflects the size of our fleet being larger. We spent a robust amount of CapEx in the first quarter and increased the average size of our fleet by 16%. But it also reflects nice performance on time utilization. Time was 52.3% and that was up 120 basis points over the comparable period last year and that represents yet another record for the quarter in the company\u2019s history. So, strong time on a larger fleet and getting the rate, it\u2019s a pretty strong combination, we are firing on all cylinders and it gives us great momentum on rental revenue for the early part of 2012.", "The other part of the revenue story that\u2019s worth noting is the used equipment result for the quarter. We sold $76 million of proceeds of used equipment in Q1 and that\u2019s up robustly from $32 million last year. Combined with that huge volume though was the gross margin result that was very strong, 38.2% gross margin and while it down a little bit from last year the size what we sold was truly impressive. The real driver of that strong margin performance was our channel mix. We sold 68% of that total volume of used sales through our retail channel. It was combined with a robust pricing environment, don\u2019t get me wrong, but the channel mix is a major driver for us and so we were very pleased to be able to move that volume through our retail channel. A total of $147 million of OEC sold in the first quarter, another very strong performance for us in that regard.", "Let me move briefly to profitability measures, anyway you cut it, again a strong quarter for us. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $231 million and that was up 59% over last year, $86 million more of adjusted EBITDA this year compared to last year and along with that a great performance on margin. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 35.2% and that was an increase of 750 basis points over last year. So nice performance on the top line, also good results in the cost of rentals and our SG&A performance as well, all of that contributed nicely in Q1.", "On a flow-through basis, the adjusted EBITDA flow-through to total revenue was 64.7% for the quarter, again a robust performance and fully consistent with the range that we have given you for the full year of 62% to 65%.", "EPS, again, another strong performance there. Adjusted EPS for the quarter is $0.36 of profit and that compares to a $0.32 a share loss last year. So, again, by any measure a strong profitability performance.", "A couple of words real briefly on our capital plan for fleet and free cash flow for the quarter. On CapEx we spent $390 million of gross rental CapEx in the quarter. That\u2019s a very very strong CapEx performance on the company\u2019s part and I must say a strong performance on the part of the vendors as well. They were able to deliver a very large amount very rapidly in Q1 and certainly it was something that we wanted to take because we saw a very robust demand out there as you could imagine from taking $390 million of gross rental CapEx spend and still driving improvements in your time utilization in the first quarter seasonally weak. It\u2019s a pretty strong performance. So, $390 of gross capital spends in the quarter. The spend has been as we have done for the last and several quarters, focused more on those categories that we are interested in, in the particular Boom and Scissor lifts and Forklifts and we have got some more earth moving equipment coming in for the quarter. So a good spend quarter for us on gross capital.", "Our free cash flow in the quarter was a usage of $89 million that compares to a free cash flow source of $70 million in the first quarter of last year. The swing certainly reflecting the larger capital spend that we have played this year.", "Let me as a final couple of comments update our thoughts about our outlook for 2012. I\u2019ll reemphasize but these are standalone view of our outlook and obviously we will update the forward view of the company once we have closed the transaction with RSC. Our expectation is that we will offer some further guidance on the combined company in the middle of May once we have had a chance to take a closer look at some more detailed data from RSC. But for United Rentals, as it relates to rate, we are reaffirming the 5% rental rate improvement that we expect for the full year, and as I said before, our first quarter performance is clearly consistent with that level of improvement.", "On time utilization, again we are sticking with the 0.5% improvement in time utilization for the full year that we had previously provided. And again, our first quarter experience is consistent with that kind of time, especially when you look at the pace that we have been bringing in new capital.", "On capital spend, we are going to continue to target about $1 billion of gross capital spend for the year. Although now given the strong start on used sales proceeds we have reduced slightly the amount of net rental CapEx that we expect for the full year. We are now calling net rental CapEx in the $700 to $750 range, down roughly $70 million from where we were previously. I will point out that I have got a question or two from folks about whether that reduction in the net rental CapEx target without moving our free cash flow target for the full year does that imply any reduction in our outlook for profitability over the course of the year? The answer there is definitively no. We just are reducing the net rental CapEx to be consistent with what we have experienced and what we now expect in the way of used sales proceeds over the course of the full year.", "Again, our free cash flow target for the year is unchanged, its $50 to $100 million free cash flow negative and again we think that\u2019s the appropriate level of capital as we look at the year currently. If we execute the CapEx plan at these levels we will improve the age of our fleet, over the course of the year, it will improve roughly two-and-a-half months over the course of the full year. We got roughly three months of improvement from the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter with the level of spend that we did and the level of robust used sales. So that will continue to play out as we go through the rest of the year.", "On the profitability front, in terms of flow-through, we still think that flow through will be in the mid-60% range for the full year, call it 62% to 67%, again consistent with what we have said previously.", "Finally, let me just offer one thought on the merger. As I said, we will be updating our view about the merged company in comments that we will make a couple of weeks after we have closed. But having just completed the financing transaction I just wanted to remind everyone of our view on one of the key measures as it relates to the capital structure our total leverage. Total debt-to-EBITDA we have said previously, we expect to come down rapidly. We have included in our investor deck a view of what that means. We show there on a pro forma basis for 2011, 2012, and 2013 the total debt-to-EBITDA leverage that we expect assuming the forecast that we included in the S4. So, on a pro forma basis with those forecast assumed, we would be something like 4.6 times debt-to-EBITDA at the end of 2011, but that will come down to roughly 4 times by the end of this year and down further to roughly 3 times, 2.9 times to be overly precise, by the end of 2013. That kind of deleveraging is what we have in mind and what we think is appropriate and available to us on a combined basis.", "With that I\u2019ll end my comments and ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Matt, can you talk about your updated cost cutting targets? I believe in slide 15 it looks like the branch consolidation number has moved significantly higher, I wonder if you could just step us through the change in branch plan and also touch on relatively lower share on the corporate side as well?", "Matt Flannery", "Well, as you could imagine, we had our original model back in November/December time frame that we built out. I think at that time Bill had stated that we are going to have about two-thirds of our synergies were going to be realized in the first 12 months. As we have got into the process and started looking under the hood there is some puts and takes in some areas and you recognize one of them in the branch consolidation opportunity. We also think we can get some of that done sooner than the original model. So we have actually updated\u2013 the probably most significant update is we have updated our first 12-month, say to $147 million realized in the first 12 months and that was from about $132 to $133 million previous.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Matt, in terms of the timing you touched on to some extent is it fair to assume that the branch consolidation will be some of the faster moving operations, so is that the biggest driver of the increase to $147 million from $132 million or are there other factors that we should be thinking about?", "Matt Flannery", "I would say real estate overall we have been able to find ways to accelerate. There are no other major puts and takes but will continue to refine this and as Bill has stated there are some things we haven\u2019t been able to look at yet due to regulatory reasons and when we get into those after the close that we will might be able to incorporate some more detail into our mid-May update.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And Michael and Bill, can you touch on the CapEx sections that you are seeing out of your competitors? It\u2019s great to see you are putting the new fleet to work at very high utilization rates. For the first quarter here, I am wondering if you can comment on the range of CapEx increases that you are seeing out of your competition as well? I think we have been hearing up to 50% CapEx increases in the first quarter off of a low base for a lot of the smaller companies but we would love to hear your view on the landscape? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, Jerry, it\u2019s Mike. What we have been hearing \u2013 and from some various executives of some of our vendors is that they have been seeing a big pickup. It really came \u2013 the ARA has their first show in the first quarter and that\u2019s where there is a lot of traffic and they are seeing some upward activity. It\u2019s safe to say that I think that\u2019s a positive sign for the industry as a whole and also from United Rentals specifically we are well positioned because we have had our orders well in advance of making sure that we don\u2019t get squeezed by any lead times.", "William Plummer", "Yes, I think that a key point is that folks who are placing orders right now are going to face a much more challenging environment in terms of lead times. You have to understand what that means, when they will get the equipment and where it will put them relative to the seasoned. That\u2019s one of the things we feel good about is that we place pre-orders very extensively for the early part of this year. You see it in the CapEx that we realize in Q1. I\u2019ll mention something that I forgot to mention actually in my opening comments that as we look at our CapEx plan for the first half, previously we have said we would be spending about $600 million out of the roughly $1 billion of gross capital spend that we are going to spend this year. Our view now is that we will spend a little north of $700 million of that $1 billion in the first half and that reflects not only the pre-orders that we placed but also the relative strength of the vendor\u2019s performance. So we feel we are positioned well and yes, we are seeing some of the others place orders and the question is when do they get it and what does that mean in the marketplace.", "Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Ted.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Hi guys, congratulations on the quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Matt Flannery", "Thanks, Ted.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "I was hoping to touch on the rental gross margins and the incrementals, in particular, 84% on our math is very impressive relative to our expectations kind of history in the guidance you have given. Just wondering if you could give us as sense for what went on in the quarter that may have helped you hit those numbers and if we could possibly do the cost of rent bridge to understand the puts and takes in the quarter that would be great?", "William Plummer", "", "Sure, Ted. So, clearly the impact of rental rate is something you always have to be mind full of in this business and we had a good rental rate performance on a year-over-year basis, up 6.3%, so that gives you a nice backdrop in terms of the contribution of revenue falling to profitability but in addition to that there were a couple of, I guess, I would say one-off items that you should be aware of in order to kind of make sense of it. One is, we had a several million dollars benefit from a recapture of bonus accrual from 2011. We accrued for bonus during calendar 2011 based on an assumption about what we would pay out. When we actually made our final decisions about payout in the first quarter, we ended up paying out less than we accrued. And so, we recognize that benefit as a bonus recapture in the first quarter, in cost of rent that accounted for, as I said a few millions bucks, call it $3 million to $4 million. So that helped, we have had couple of other sort of minor puts and takes. There was a one-time personal property tax benefit that we received that was close onto a million bucks that fell in to the cost of rent bucket as well. So that is another one timer that helped with the follow through in the Q1. The rest of the year-over-year variance in cost of rent, the great majority of it is driven by variable cost associated with higher volume. As I said, volume was up over 18% in the quarter and between repair and maintenance, and delivery expense, and fuel costs, and salaries and benefits associated with the incremental headcount, that really drove the great majority of the year-over-year increase, and as I said, offset by those two benefits, those one-time benefits that I pointed out.", "So I think that\u2019s probably the way to think about it. A lot of volume related cost going up, as you would expect and as you want and then a couple of one-timers helping you out to give you that outstanding flow through. Is that helpful? We lost Ted.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Say it again.", "William Plummer", "", "I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s useful for you, anything else?", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "That is exactly what I was (inaudible).", "William Plummer", "", "Great.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "And then on the SG&A side just similar, strong kind of leverage performances, I was just wondering, if you could talk about the quarter and how we might think about the rest of the year? And, I will get back in queue.", "", "", "William Plummer", "", "Sure, so for the year-over-year in SG&A, the big drivers there, obviously wages and bonus accrual would be sort of several million dollars of that, let us say it was up $7 million, so let us say $3 million of it or so was wage and \u2013 excuse me. Total wage and bonus would have been closer to up 7 by itself, but I would point out there was a one-time headwind from that bonus recapture effect in SG&A. It was a tail wind of a few million dollars in cost of rent, there was little bit of a headwind of about a million bucks, if I remember correctly, about a million bucks in SG&A, but that combined with other wage and bonus accrual adjustments would have taken SG&A up about 7, volume related to commissions and other selling related costs would be up another 3, so now you are up 10 and then we had a very strong bad debt performance in the quarter that actually took that down to the roughly $7 million increase overall. There are a couple of other nits and nats that are kind of offset each other, but those were the big movers. So, wage and bonus and I will call it up 7, volume call it up 3, and then bad debt call it down 4 to get you to -- down 3 to 4 to get you to roughly the net up 7 that we reported.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Okay that is helpful. And on a go forward basis I know it is going to change in a couple of weeks of the combined company but any kind of guidance, Mike would be willing to share with us?", "Matt Flannery", "", "Go forward for these two cost lines.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Yeah, well SG&A and then the two cost lines?", "Matt Flannery", "", "I think, the couple of things to keep in mind is just the bonus accrual will flex with how performance plays out over the course of the year. So, we started out very strong, we are accruing to a little bit higher level of bonus than we expected in our original plan for the year and you have to watch that to see how it plays over the course of the remainder of the year. In cost to rent, you have got a trend of lowering the fleet age so there will be a benefit as we go through the year there from lower repair and maintenance expense, as a share of overall cost of rentals. So you have to keep that mind, there will be a little bit of a tail wind if we can keep the age trending down the way that we planned. Those are the things that come to mind right off. We have raises, marine increase is scheduled to take effect, that took effect at the beginning of April, so that will be on an absolute dollars basis, there will be increase of, call it 2.5% to 3% that flows through our both cost to rent and SG&A because of raises. So you have to make sure that you keep that in mind. Those are the things that come to mind Ted.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Okay, that is super helpful guys, congratulations and best of luck of this quarter.

But, as we kind of think about on the ground execution and with 2Q and 3Q being seasonally strong for the industry, how should we think about how much is going to get done over the next two quarters? Is it something that is going to have to wait till fourth quarter? And then, related to that how quickly do we expect to have the MIS systems aligned?", "Matt Flannery", "", "Great questions Manish, I would say as far as the synergy timing, what we do expect to get in this calendar year will be more towards the back half of the year. We really need to use the second quarter to validate some of the assumptions we have made to take look and make sure that -- we want to be prudent. As I had stated in my opening comments, the most important thing is to make this a seamless transition for the customer. With that being said, whether it falls in the third or fourth quarter is not going to be managed output for us. As opposed to getting them done as quickly as we can, so that we can move with our operational best practices. So that will be my answer on the timing issue of the synergies.

", "Matt Flannery", "", "Yes.", "Manish Somaiya -- Citi ", "", "Okay and then just two other quick questions, one is on branding, any thoughts on keeping two brands, one brand and then just on Tier 4, I know we have talked about Tier 4 equipment in the past, but now that we have more of that equipment in the field, may be if you can talk about what kind of pricing you are getting on Tier 4 versus non Tier 4? Are you getting more because certainly I mean you are paying more on Tier 4, so may be if you can just kind outline something\u2019s there for us? ", "Michael Kneeland ", "", "Manish, I will handle the branding question and I will pass of the other part of your question on prices of the equipment to both Matt and Bill. But, branding is a great question, I want to make sure everyone understand that the name will remain United Rentals, but to me a brand is much more than just a name. It is about understanding and implementing a vision and getting collective of thoughts from our employees our customers and our investors. And once we collect an information, we will come forward at the appropriate time to voice and communicate what our vision and our statement will be going forward, but right day one it is going to be United Rentals and RSC, it will be plus United RSC and I will tell you that we have got, -- I assume this is what Mat talked about on teams from both sides. We have a gentlemen from RSC who is leading this up, going deep inside the organization and collecting some very very good information about the people\u2019s collective thoughts around both companies and I think that is the important. This is an opportunity for us, because it is a new phase of not only our company but I think of the industry to step back and take a look at our brand. On the question of pricing --", "Matt Flannery", "", "Manish, was your question about whether we realized different pricing, different rental rates for Tier 4 versus Tier 3 units.", "Manish Somaiya -- Citi ", "", "Yes, exactly that.", "", "", "Matt Flannery", "", "No, the short answer. Although, I will expand a little bit, we are looking at segregating the assets for two reasons, not just for pricing reasons, but if we have a -- as the manufacturers are manufacturing a limited amount of Tier 4 and as you can imagine they face into the fleet will initially we a small percentage, we want to segregate them out to make sure that customers who have Tier 4 requirements on the project or in the states that they are in, that those assets are separated out, so they don\u2019t -- the worst think we could do is send a Tier 4 engine to a project or customer that doesn\u2019t need it. So that does give us the opportunity to separate them out from the rest of the category which then you would obviously look at how the pricing will play out.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, your question please.", "William Plummer", "", "Hey Scott", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "Thanks Mike, good morning. I guess my first question would be, how do you guys feel with regard to visibility into the upcoming peak season and the full year from what you are seeing and hearing from the field on, just on projects and what is the visibility (inaudible)?", "William Plummer", "", "I will talk about, what we, the visibility around the customers and I will ask Matt to talk more about projects and what he is seeing more of from a geography stand point. As you know, we have quality business reviews with all of our business segments and we go into depth about talking about what we are understanding and hearing from the customers. Similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, our first quarter results from all indications from our customers remains true 80% came back and said that they see 2012 to be equal to or better than 2011. So, we see that as being comforting, I will also tell you anecdotally, and all the quite comments I have had with customers. They are seeing the level of biding activity go up again and that is another healthy indication of the environment. As far as geography and projects Mat will you \u2013", "Matt Flannery", "", "Scott as far geographically our growth has been very broad based in North America, we had all but four states showing year-over-year growth and the large majority of those have been double digit, as far as those states showing growth. And the four states that haven\u2019t shown growth are in the single digits and then in Canada, all but two provinces has shown growth so, the growth is wide spread, which is good news for us, they are coming from the sectors that you would imagine, the energy sector through power plants and oil and gas drilling, through manufacturing there is some large projects that are going on there like to Walker project and the BigThree[ph] are starting to invest back into their plants and even the commercial sector is up, right here in lower Manhattan, we have got five major projects going on with the four Freedom Towers and the 9/11 Memorial as well as a path transportation upgrade, so the opportunities are pretty broad based. ", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "Great, thanks, if I could sneak through into my last question, could you comment on the weather impact in first quarter, if there is, if it influences the second quarter at all? And then Bill, separately how should we model used equipment sales margins going forward? Thanks, that is it from me, I appreciate it.", "Michael Kneeland ", "", "Excuse me, can you rephrase your first question, did you talk about the weather?", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "Yeah, just weather, general question on how you think it influenced the quarter and will that have any influence on second quarter results.", "Michael Kneeland ", "", "Weather is always one that and in particularly in the fourth quarter and first quarter is really any mans guess, as we go through it. As you know that everyone has noted that there was a very warm and dry winter across North America and has it benefited us? Absolutely. How can I quantify it? Very difficult. Do I think it is going to impact the project and our type of customer that we go after in the second quarter? No, most of those are well start up projects, they have to bring their steel, the steel is ordered well in advance, they just can\u2019t fast forward that that quickly. With regard to some of the smaller projects, yeah there are probably some projects that got longer term that probably came on board sooner, I don\u2019t see them ramping or taking away from the second quarter, given the demand that we are seeing and also we are bring in more CapEx because of the demand that our customers are expressing to us, so that is how we see it.", "William Plummer", "", "And Scott on your second question about modeling used margins, I guess what we have said is that, if you go back over a long period, 10 years or so and exclude \u201909 and \u201910 which are obviously major upheaval years, our used margins have been in that high twenties kind of percent area over each of those years. Given the strong start that we had to this year, I think it is very fair to say that that will be a little bit higher than we normally have been we were last year, I think we realized for the full year used margins of 31 and change, 31.7% and I would have to guess that we would do that at least again this year as just a general statement to how to model it. So, I would say higher than our normal historic average, I will let you use your imagination for how much higher.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "Right, thanks guys great job.", "William Plummer", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of from David Raso from ISI Group, your question please.", "William Plummer", "", "Hi David", "", "", "Operator", "", "David, you might have your phone on mute.", "", "", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "", "Sorry, I am here, thank you. Two quick questions, first the progress you see quarterly on the rental rates in the fleet utilization to maintain those full year targets. I appreciate seasonally the rental revenue in the first quarter doesn\u2019t completely carry its -- say 25% of the year waiting, but specially on the fleet utilization, if we were positive 120 bps year-over-year in the first quarter and we are looking for 50 for the full year, can you walk us in that quarterly progression? Are you expecting the back half of the year, fleet utilization to be largely flat at that stage or how do you think that would do that progression?", "William Plummer", "", "Yeah David, it\u2019s very clearly that as we get into the back half of the year, we are going to be comping really huge utilization quarter. So, we brought the year-over-year improvement down aggressively in the back half to reflect that very fact. So, we think half a percent, we can make without giving a specific year-over-year number by quarter. Yeah, it comes down pretty close to nothing as you get further out. And keep in mind obviously, the fleet is getting much larger and we are comping very strong utilizations last year, so in our view that is going to require us to put a huge amount on rent as we get that larger fleet in. And our belief is that the markets there, the demands there to be able to do that, but that\u2019s underlying the time utilization model. On rental rates and the progression there, the one way to think about it is, given what we did in the first quarter, we would need something like half a percent per month sequentially out through October and then basically nothing sequentially thereafter, in order to deliver the 5% full year. So, that\u2019s very clearly within the realm of reasonable and as always we are going to look for more if it is there. Does that help?", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "", "Well, could you give us some color on how the rates were moving sequentially, I know there is some seasonality with the first quarter, but how much were rates up March versus February? How are we looking at April so far versus March? Just to see how that progression is playing out so far?", "William Plummer", "", "Sure, so on a sequential basis, I would give you the sequentials and I would remind everybody that this is on ARA basis. The sequentials for January, sequential is down 6/10th and then it went positive 3/10th and then flat in March. And I guess, I would offer that April is -- the first half of April has been strong. Just to give you a comparison, if you look at last year, the sequentials in January were down half a percent and February up 2/10th and March down 2/10th, so the sequential progression this year is actually better than it was last year, when you think about the monthly sequentials, so that again gives us a lot of confidence that we are off on a nice run and that the 5% should be attained.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "Then when it comes to CapEx, lets say your comment, first half of the year you\u2019ll be over 700 million of the billion growth lets call it 07/10 for argument sake. It implies to back after the year CapEx is down 20% year-over-year. How shall I think about that in the sense of by the time we get to June how are you viewing the age year old t? Are you comfortable with that? Or simply look that is the map, it is right map, but we will obviously evaluate the CapEx when we get there. How shall I think about that back up CapEx implication.", "William Plummer", "You said it beautifully. I don\u2019t question the map, but we\u2019ve done and you\u2019ve seen us do it the last several years right. What we do is, we assess where the market is and where it is heading and how it feels and whether we can put more CapEx on rent at good rates and expect good returns over the longer haul and if and when we make that call we are not short about raising our CapEx guidance. I think we\u2019ve done it all three years that I have been here and so our plan is bring the 700 in the market certainly feels like it will soak that up right here now and then lets take a look around as we get toward the end of the second quarter and make a separate call about whether we should be raising the back CapEx expectation or leave it where it is.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "And related to that question from my very last question, the CapEx\u2019s decision to bring the equipment in a little earlier, that may be the original plan in the first quarter. What drove that? I mean obviously you can answer the business was strong (inaudible), but safe from the supplier side or some of the dynamics that drove that decision and take the equipment a little earlier and if you could enlighten us like when was that decision made, I am not sure how quick your suppliers can respond to a change in that decision?", "William Plummer", "So, great question. We started placing pre-orders for the first two quarters in late last year and I think the first pre-orders that we placed we probably did in like September and that was the signal to our vendors that we were going to have demand, robust demand in the first half of the year. So, they started to position themselves to be able to deliver against those pre-orders as sort of a baseline of capacity. They did a nice job of ramping up their production capacity and they were able to supply fleet into us, quite honestly even faster than we had in our plan with the pre-orders. So, we asked ourselves can the market absorb more fleet faster than what we had thought and we concluded, yes it can and so we said yes if you can ship it we\u2019ll take it and that played out very nicely and resulted in the numbers that you saw for Q1 and what you\u2019ll see for the first half and it was a combination of the market being able to absorb additional fleet and the vendors being able to supply it and in us obviously being able to buy it. So, it all worked together to accelerate the CapEx.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "Alright, great. I really appreciate it. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS. Your question please.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Hey good morning guys.", "William Plummer", "Good morning Henry.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "You\u2019ve sold a lot of equipment over the last few quarter into the used market, just wanted you if you could talk about who is buying, it is generally staying in the equipments original home market or have you seen international buyers come in and clear it out of your serve market.", "William Plummer", "Michael, you want to say something.", "Michael Kneeland", "I am just going to say Henry, I actually attended one of the auctions, actually both of the auction. Actually, both of the auctions that the two large auction houses I had in February and the general feel I had and the comments I received back was at the offshoring of equipment actually went up significantly over the prior year. That\u2019s to me is a tell-tale sign. That demand is robust in other parts of the globe and the demand for our equipment which realistically, if you are looking for used equipment there is no better market than the US and North America, because it\u2019s still the largest producers of used inventory.", "Matt Flannery", "The who is buying question, as we said many times before it really is the who is who of people who use equipment, so wide range of folks. But I do think Michael\u2019s point is a very important one. Strong offshore demand I think is really supplementing demand that we are seeing from a wide range of customers here in North America.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s helpful. One follow up, could you talk a little bit about how far along do you think we are on the secular shift? And maybe, how does the new prospect look today compared with a year ago, cycle is picking up, have you seen an increase in enquires from potential customers who weren\u2019t renting before?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, Henry, we have had this discussion and we have been talking with Global Insight with Scott Hazelton and as you know they have been commissioned by the American Rental Association to do some research. All indications that they have put forward based on a lot of data that realistically is very in depth, they are suggesting that the CAGR growth for our industry over five years is going to be somewhere in the vicinity of 12.5%. That\u2019s a pretty healthy number by any stretch of the imagination. When you asked about secular shift and what happens, I think that going into this year they are continuing to see that secular shift movement going in a positive direction. When the capital markets are wide open, when you asked them what has occurred historically the secular penetration doesn\u2019t decline, it levels itself off until the next downturn and then it actually goes back up again, continues its march upward. I don\u2019t think that that pattern is going to change and what we are seeing right here and now.", "Henry Kirn \u2013 UBS", "Thanks a lot. Congratulations.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Matt Flannery", "Thanks, Henry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Due to time constraints this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I would like to hand the program back to Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Okay. Well, thank you very much operator. I\u2019ll remind everyone that to download our new IR presentation from our website we have made some substantial updates since our last quarter and obviously if there is any additional questions please reach out to Fred Bratman so that we can answer your questions specifically.

Before we begin, note that the Company\u2019s press release, comments made on today\u2019s call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements.", "The Company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risk and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control and, consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 as well as the subsequent filings with the SEC.", "You can access these filings on the Company's website at www.ur.com.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning everyone and welcome. With me today are Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, and Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer and other members of our senior management team.", "The financial results we reported last night were strong. They reflect an operating environment with a solid level of demand and integration with RSC that\u2019s very much on track and most important the successful execution of our strategy as reflected in our margins.", "Now we will talk about all three of these things today, but also I want to give you some \u2013 our current thinking about the months ahead. But before I begin, I want to remind you that any year-over-year comparisons we give you are on a pro forma basis that is measured against combined results of United Rentals and RSC for 2011.", "So just take a look at the quarter. It incorporated the most intense three months of our integration plan. From July to September, we completed the harmonization of most of our major account relationships, realigned our sales territories and closed 126 branches bringing the merger related closings to a 187 so far. We deliberately set the bar high to get most of the heavy lifting behind us by September 30th and I\u2019m very happy to say that we met that goal. And while we\u2019re managing all that change, we generated a solid 9% increase in rental revenue year-over-year and $570 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 47% margin. That\u2019s the highest margin, yeah. And in addition we\u2019re running ahead of plan and cost synergies.", "We realized another $45 million of savings in the third quarter and we now expect to reach a $100 of realized cost synergies in 2012 for our ultimate goal of $230 million to $250 million on a run rate basis. Our cost \u2013 our progress on the cost side and a magnitude of our flow through sale bought up our internal discipline in the quarter.", "Now turning to the external environment, let\u2019s look at the drivers of rental revenue. And they really reflect two things, a favorable market condition for the equipment rental and a successful execution of our strategy. The number one driver is rates. Our rates were very strong in the quarter, up 7.5% from last year and our volume of equipment on rent also improved 7.9%. As these numbers show, we saw a continued robust demand for our equipment that was also universal. All but one of our regions reported year-over-year increases in rental rates.", "It\u2019s also significant that we were able to raise rates and what continues to be a modest and somewhat uneven construction recovery. But there are something more work here and we believe it\u2019s the rental penetration. The rental options continue to gain traction as an economically sound way to solve equipment needs and its adding an extra layer of demand.", "I also want to talk about time utilization. It declined 200 basis points in the quarter compared to a robust level of utilization last year. So what were the impacts on time? For one thing we absorbed those 187 branch closings and we put more than a $1 billion of new fleet into the field. On a year-over-year basis, our time utilization was about 67% through September. And that\u2019s a healthy number and we feel very comfortable with it.", "And so far for the fourth quarter utilization is running more than 72%. Our record margin makes it clear that were reflecting \u2013 managing rates, utilization, and costs. Nevertheless we want to be as accurate as possible about the numbers we put out there and that\u2019s why we\u2019re updating our full-year outlook.", "We now expect time utilization to be approximately 67.5% for the year, which is a half a point below our prior outlook and we raised our outlook on rates to reflect a gain of approximately 7% year-over-year. We also think that will do better than expected on our free cash position. Our outlook is now free cash usage in the range of $25 million to $50 million excluding a merger related cost. And our guidance for total revenue, EBITDA and CapEx remains unchanged.", "A minute ago I mentioned branch closings. We typically have a revenue dyssynergy when we close a location, title loss of business from small to mid sized customers and over time that revenue gets replaced. Now given a reduction in branches and headcount related to the merger, the impact in the third quarter could have been substantial. But our field organization did a great job of keeping our larger account relationships on even keel and this went a long way toward offsetting that impact.", "You\u2019ve heard me say many times before that large customers are the foundation of our strategy and for the most part they reacted very positively to the integration. In the third quarter, our key account business which accounts \u2013 which includes national strategic, assigned and government accounts grew by 17% year-over-year.", "To summarize, the headwinds from the integration are largely behind us. And the top line impact from the branch closings should stayed over in the next six months. Our entire field organization has done a great job at business retention and we now have our sales force focused on growth and our fleet is settling into a new footprint and is more available to meet demand.", "And we just delivered a record EBITDA margin. Fortunately this is playing out against favorable conditions in the rental industry. However, we\u2019re aware the speculation is out there and we\u2019re watching the macro environment very closely for any signs of deterioration. But we\u2019re not seeing any cost or concern at this time and we don\u2019t see any reason to alter our plan.", "As you may know a couple of equipment manufacturers did voice some concerns about the economic recently \u2013 about the economy recently. And while rental companies and equipment manufacturers serve similar customer basis, we believe our industry is in a better position right now because of rental penetration. That\u2019s why our top line is outpaced in construction spending because a very cautiously recovery can be create more demand for rental \u2013 for the rental industry while reducing demand for product purchases.", "Now Matt will be giving some color about our performance by region and also describe what we\u2019re hearing from our customers. Overall, they\u2019re feeling optimistic about next year. Global Insight also believes the recovery we will continue and are holding firm to their forecast for an increase between 8% and 9% in equipment rental revenues in 2013 and we share that feel.", "And we will be talking to you again on our Investor Day, on December 4th, and we plan to update you on our thoughts on 2013 at that time. Right now, we\u2019re focused on delivering a strong finish to the year that comes down to one word, execution. Now I want to remind everyone that our destination has been long-term profitable growth from day one of our strategy. We put that strategy in place four years ago and at a time our vision was for 40% EBITDA margin within five years.", "As you saw last night, we\u2019ve already exceeded that goal and now we\u2019re looking for ways to expand on it. So stay tuned. We\u2019ve lot of confidence in our ability to deliver even greater value for the future.", "So now, I will ask Matt to give you an update on our operations, and then Bill will cover the financial results. And after that, we will take your questions. So over to you Matt.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to start with the progress report on our integration efforts and then give you a brief overview of market conditions across our regions. On our call in July, we reported that our integration efforts got off to a very strong start and we\u2019ve made significant progress since our call. Our field team has heard me say from the very beginning of this merger that we need to focus on moving the big rocks. This means making sure we\u2019ve communicated with our key customers and our sales territories are realigned to eliminate confusion and that we communicate with our new operational footprint will be to serve our customers.", "So let me take a minute to tell you what we\u2019ve done. I will start with the customer first. Our sales team has done a great job of focusing on our key accounts which grew by 17% in Q3. Now this was partially due to the fact that this past quarter we finalized over a 125 new national account agreements. And we\u2019re negotiating while complete the remaining 260 throughout Q4.", "Additionally, we realigned over a 1000 sales rep territories. Now this was a large and necessary undertaking due to the overlap in coverage between reps from the two legacy companies. Our reps have now been in their territories for over 60 days and they\u2019re well on their way to further penetrating their new territories and the customers that they\u2019re calling on.", "To assist the sales team, we\u2019ve implemented an early warning report for declining revenue customers and we\u2019ve given them multiple tools to identify additional revenue opportunities, like our dormant account program. After eight weeks of this program, we reactivated almost 2,500 accounts that have rented over $60 million worth of fleet. And we feel that this is work well worth doing to help recapture some of the revenue leakage that occurred during our consolidation efforts.", "And operationally as Mike mentioned, we completed a 126 branch consolidations in Q3 and that takes our year-to-date total to 187. We\u2019ve integrated the teams into common facilities, one technology platform and most importantly one voice to the customer in the effective markets. We\u2019ve charged forward with an aggressive closure schedule and that speed of execution has allowed us to capture $45 million in cost synergies in Q3. So as a result, we\u2019ve increased our 2012 achieved cost synergy target to a $100 million.", "Additionally, we\u2019ve increased the top side of our range of our fully developed synergy guidance from $230 million to $250 million. When I break out the $45 million in cost saved in Q3, closures contributed about $18 million, and field staffing and corporate overhead reduction contributed $11 million each. Those three buckets totaled $40 million of the $45 million we achieved.", "We\u2019ve also seen significant improvement in our branch productivity related to cost of rentals. This is specifically evident in markets where we\u2019ve consolidated stores and taken advantage of the economies of scale. Our average store sizes increased by 30% in Q3 year-over-year. That\u2019s how we\u2019re able to grow our fleet by almost 10% over last year, while reducing the headcount that serves that fleet by more than 5.5%.", "Now we did face a few bumps in the road while moving through the integration. We\u2019ve seen that our closure markets didn\u2019t grow quite as fast as our non-closure markets. And that\u2019s with this synergy that we feel comfortable we will recover through the focused sales efforts I discussed earlier.", "I\u2019d like to emphasize how proud I\u2019m of our employees for coming together as a true team. Almost half of our employees have had their jobs or reporting structure changed in someway as a result of the merger. But their commitment to United Rentals is as strong as ever and this is supported by a voluntary turnover which is down from last year as well as the tremendous engagement we encountered while conducting town halls in over 50 markets.", "Now switching over to our Q3 regional results, we saw a positive rental revenue growth in all, but one of our geographic regions. And we had over 27% growth in our specialty regions. Some of the higher growth markets are across the Gulf States and in the Southwest, but we\u2019re also seeing strong growth in Western Canada, the Mountain of west and the Midwest regions. All but one of our business units are seeing strong EBITDA growth and improved rates.", "During my travel the past few weeks, I\u2019ve had many long standing customers inform me that their backlog is strong. And they want assurance that we will have the fleet ready to serve their major projects. These comments are consistent with results we\u2019re seeing from our monthly customer surveys where over 90% of participants say they expect their business next year to be at least as good as this year and almost half of those participants feel they will up 10% or more in 2013.", "Before I turn the call over to Bill for the financial update, I\u2019d like to state how positive I feel that strategically we\u2019ve never been in a better position to win in the marketplace. And that\u2019s really what this integration is all about. We\u2019ve been building deeper partnerships with our industrial and national accounts, we\u2019re focused on cross selling the strength of each legacy company and we continue to focus on improving our customer scorecard.", "Those are the pillars of our strategy and our roadmap to success. So thanks for your time and now over to Bill.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks, Matt, and good morning to everyone. As is usual, I will add a little bit more color to the third quarter results and I will also spend little time updating our outlook for the full-year. And before I get started, I will just remind everyone as Michael did that all of the comparisons and comments that we make are about the pro forma company combined basis comparing to as though we\u2019ve combined in the prior period.", "So let me start with net revenue first. Net revenue was up 8.9% in the quarter with strong contributions from both rental rate and fleeted on rent. Rates were up 7.5% compared to the third quarter last year and they were 2.8 percentage points better sequentially versus the second quarter of this year.", "I will touch on it a bit later, but given the strong pricing performance that we\u2019re seeing throughout, we\u2019re comfortable increasing our outlook for the full-year and now expect rates to be up 7% for the full 2012.", "Looking at our volume performance and time utilization, you all know that our measure of time utilization is obviously on rent. That measure was up 7.9% in the quarter to a record for us of $5.2 billion of fleet on rent on average throughout the quarter. So clearly there was a strong demand environment and that certainly supported our investment in the fleet.", "Time utilization for the quarter was 69.8% and that is a very strong absolute level and it\u2019s certainly consistent with the demand environment that we\u2019ve been dealing with. Unfortunately, time utilization was down 200 basis points compared to last year and that reflects a few factors. So maybe I will spend a second on those factors.", "First as Michael mentioned, we had the consolidation effort really at its peak during the quarter, closing a 187 branches in total, 126 of them happened during the quarter. So that was the largest factor we think in the year-over-year decline and time utilization. The closures were essentially completed by the end of the July, but when you move that much fleet as Matt pointed out when you change that many sales rep territories and leadership changes, it has an impact on the business and we certainly saw that in the third quarter.", "The second factor was the higher absolute level of fleet. We\u2019ve been talking about this all year. We have brought in a tremendous amount of new fleet. We spent $1.3 billion on new fleet purchases year-to-date and in any sense that\u2019s a large increase to our fleet overall and it makes it tougher to achieve the same levels of time utilization that we did last year.", "Lastly the second half of the year last year was a very robust time utilization environment. It was a record for both companies or the combined companies and that makes for a very difficult set of comparisons this year.", "So before I turn to used sales, I\u2019ll spend a couple of minutes on the impact of mix in our rental revenue this quarter. We\u2019ve gotten questions from several folks about the fact that our rates are up 7.5%, our volume is up 7.9%, but we only increased total rental revenue or rental revenue by 8.9%, so where\u2019s the difference? What's the key driver of that negative mix if you will?", "In our view the key drivers were \u2013 it started with our monthly mix. Our business shifted more toward monthly during the quarter by a significant amount, 75.5% of our revenues in the quarter were from monthly business and that\u2019s up 270 basis points compared to last year. Now remember the higher proportion of monthly rentals will drive revenue in the quarter down because the revenue per day that you generate from a monthly transaction is lower than it is on a daily and weekly transaction, that\u2019s just a fundamental feature of our pricing structure. So that monthly mix impact was pretty significant in the headwind that we experienced in the quarter.", "We also had an impact now from ancillary items. So within our rental revenue, our rentals that are \u2013 items that are ancillary to a rental \u2013 delivery is one example. So when we look at those ancillary items, there are fewer opportunities for us to realize ancillaries when we have more monthly transactions, and it shows up as part of the mix headwind that we\u2019re experiencing.", "So for example if you look within our rental revenue and look at just the owned equipment rental, the revenue that comes from the owned equipment being on rent, excluding the ancillaries that was up a very healthy 11.6% in the quarter. But when you look at some of the ancillaries like delivery for example; delivery was only up 1.5%. So that impact also plays to the mix headwind that we\u2019ve seen.", "Keep in mind now that this is all very consistent with the strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing since the last four years. The higher monthly mix certainly brings along a better margin opportunity because it certainly reduces the amount of cost associated with generating that revenue. So when you put it all together we feel very comfortable that the 8.9% revenue growth was a very solid base for driving our business forward and more importantly it allowed us the opportunity to delivery very strong profit improvement.", "Speaking of profitability, the numbers you saw. Adjusted EBITDA was $570 million for the quarter and an adjusted margin of 46.8% and as Mike said that\u2019s a record for the Company. That\u2019s an improvement of 700 basis points in margin compared to last year, and it delivered a flow through of 127% for the quarter, so clearly outstanding result on flow through. The synergy contribution is obviously significant there with the synergies adding $45 million in the quarter. But even when you exclude the impact of synergies it was still a very impressive flow through performance, 81% taking out the $45 million from synergies.", "When you look at EPS, we reported an adjusted EPS in the quarter of $1.35. We pointed out in our press release last night that, that EPS benefited from a low tax rate 22.3% in the quarter. But even if you use a more normal tax rate it\u2019s an impressive EPS result; we would call it $1.27 if you would use a tax rate right around 35%. So EPS performance was also very strong for the quarter. Before I move to the outlook, let me touch just a couple of minutes on used sales and liquidity.", "First on used equipment sales; we generated $101 million of used sales proceeds and that was at a robust 40.3% gross margin and that\u2019s the gross margin adjusted to exclude the impact of the purchase accounting activity. That margin certainly reflects overall strong demand, but we also had a very healthy mix of retail transactions in the quarter as well supporting the margin. When you look at liquidity and our cap structure, as of the end of the quarter we had total liquidity of $751 million and that included $683 million of available capacity in our asset base loan facility.", "I\u2019ll point out also that during the quarter we increased the size of our accounts receivable securitization facility. We took it from $300 million up to $475 million and we did that clearly to take advantage of the very low cost of those facilities, very attractive financing and it makes a ton of sense to do so.", "So, before I move on to questions and answers, just real quickly on our outlook, to update it. First on rental rate, as we mentioned earlier we expect rates now to be up 7% on the full-year and that\u2019s compared to our prior outlook of 6.5%. On time utilization, we now expect time utilization to be down about a half a point for the full-year but still at a very healthy 67.5% over 2012.", "Our CapEx outlook is unchanged. We still expect to spend gross capital of about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with that netting out to a net rental capital of between $1.075 billion and $1.125 billion.", "Free cash flow expectations have increased. Previously we were guiding to a free cash usage for the year between $90 million to $140 million. We now expect that free cash usage to be between $25 million and $75 million for the full-year and remember that view of free cash flow excludes the impact of the merger related cost, but it does include the impact of converting the RSC accounts payable policies to the shorter United Rentals payable policies.", "Those are the key comments that I\u2019d offer right here and now. Certainly we\u2019ll be glad to address any questions in Q&A. So, if we can ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Hey, Mike. Thanks. Good morning, guys and a nice work. If I can make my one question a two parter, the first part would be, could you discuss the utilization trend months to months to months sequentially as you progress through third quarter into fourth quarter. And my second question is; with regard to this CapEx guidance for this year; could you give us an idea of what you\u2019re thinking for next year and how CapEx would compare to this year and perhaps how free cash flow would compare to this year? Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll give you the time and then I\u2019ll shift it over to Bill on the capital. Once you look at July, we were at 68.6%. For August we were at 69.7%. For September we were at 71%. As I mentioned in my opening comments as we stand for the month of October we\u2019re slightly above 72%.", "William B. Plummer", "And Scott on CapEx, I\u2019ll start with just an additional comment about 2012. We\u2019re maintaining the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, but we\u2019re focused more on the lower-end of that range for 2012 and we think that that\u2019s an appropriate way to think about it right here and now. As we look at 2013, we haven\u2019t definitely set a plan, but our general thought is that, our capital plan will look pretty similar next year to what it does this year, about flat it could be a touch lower and by a touch $50 million is sort of where I define a touch.", "If we do what we think we\u2019re going to do next year in terms of operational results, with that kind of a capital plan our free cash flow is probably going to be in the range of $400 million to $500 million. That\u2019s consistent with the forecast that we put in the S-4 that we released earlier this year and it\u2019s still consistent with how we\u2019re thinking about the next year or so.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Okay, thanks Bill. I appreciate it.", "William B. Plummer", "No problem.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co.", "Great, thanks. Just following up on the last question; so the free cash flow will continue to improve over the next year, you\u2019ve upped the guide and you\u2019ve \u2013 you started to build out your fleet early in the cycle maybe ahead of the cycle and you\u2019re going to see the benefits. So you\u2019ve laid out some targets for reducing leverage over the next 12 months, any update to the specific leverage ratio you\u2019re looking at Bill, say a year from now. And then beyond that, what do you see happening with free cash flow beyond 2013, and what's your ultimate thought\u2019s on where the leverage is going to go other uses of cash and so forth?", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks Vance. So, we\u2019ve spent some time recently with our Board talking about this very topic and we\u2019ve aligned around a view that we will be targeting a lower level of leverage to sustain over the next number of years. So if you look at leverage just as total debt to EBITDA and I know that\u2019s overly simplistic, but just to keep it simple we\u2019re now targeting a range of between 2.5 and 3.5 times total debt to EBITDA and we feel comfortable that we can maintain that range over the next number of years and it reflects the cash flow profile that we expect to see over the next few years starting with that $400 million to $500 million range next year. 2.5 to 3.5 will be a normal operating range, so in good time we\u2019ll trend down towards the lower-end of that range.", "Right now we expect by the end of next year, if you look in our investor deck if we give you some very broad brush forecast. We expect that by the end of the next year we\u2019ll be solidly in the middle of that range, right at about three times, and from being just below four times on a trailing 12 basis right here and now. So nice robust de-levering over the next year to two, and we think that it makes sense for us to maintain those leverage levels as we go forward.", "What do we do with the cash flow beyond 2013, can I answer that question next year. I think we want to think very carefully about where we reinvest the free cash flow that we have. We\u2019re certainly going to be bringing down debt consistently over the next several years and \u2013 but we also want to make sure that we\u2019re looking for the opportunities that makes sense for our investors.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co.", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And then may be just a clarification on something earlier. You talked about the shift towards the monthly renting and the impact that, that has which makes perfect sense, but I might have missed it, but what's driving the shit itself. I would have thought in this uncertain environment with the elections coming up and so forth that, if anything rental periods would get even shorter. So, what do you think the driver is there?", "William B. Plummer", "I think it\u2019s the strategy. We\u2019ve been targeting the key account groups that historically have rented the equipment for longer periods of time, and as we grow the share of revenue from those accounts, it\u2019s a natural outgrowth of being with those accounts and its playing very well. It\u2019s playing very much according to the strategy. As you grow with those folks you give yourself a better margin opportunity, because the cost fall away and it\u2019s driving to that result as we speak.", "Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley & Co.", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group. Your question please.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Hi, David.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Hi, good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Good morning.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Hi my question is about rates heading into \u201913. Two angles on it; when you speak with your larger customers, some of the larger accounts you mentioned earlier you\u2019re in conversations with. How are the rates looking from current levels looking out to the new contracts for \u201913? And then secondarily if we kept the rates where they are today and just ran them out flat; how do you see that rolling into next year for full-year rental rates or maybe how first quarter \u201913 would look? Just trying to get some sensitivity.", "Matthew Flannery", "David this is Matt, I\u2019ll talk about the key account rate harmonizations that we\u2019re doing. We have \u2013 as I stated we\u2019ve already inked and completed a third of those. We\u2019re in negotiations with the other two-thirds, and the improvement is falling in line with our overall improvement and certainly we feel it accretive to our goals.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "And David on 2013; if we do what we expect to do what we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to do at 7% for rate this year, that will give us a carryover benefit next year something like 2.5% even if we don\u2019t advance rates any at all during 2013. So, pretty good tailwind to start, but let me be clear. We certainly do expect to drive rates beyond that carryover, but we\u2019ve got a nice starting point.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Okay. And then on the debt reduction comment. The total debt at the end of this quarter over trailing EBITDA, pro forma is about 3.9%.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "That\u2019s right.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "To get to your full-year free cash flow, the fourth quarter is going to be significant cash flow. And then you have the $400 million to $500 million as a baseline you\u2019re talking about for next year. You\u2019re using total debt in your comment, a set of net debt, just so I understand what you plan on doing with the cash that comes in, in the fourth quarter and next year just for the pure calc? I was trying to understand the exact math because the 3.5% seems like something especially EBITDA grows at all you\u2019re going to be below that pretty quickly. I just want to make sure how you look on that calculation?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "So, the cash that flows in during the fourth quarter we\u2019ll immediately reduce the ABL and that will drive down that overall debt through the ABL balance. And then as we go forward as I said, we\u2019re going to be right at about three times debt to EBITDA by the end of next year on our current view. And so you\u2019re right, we\u2019ll certainly be in the lower-end of the range pretty quickly, and we\u2019ll be looking very carefully at how we should deploy that cash flow with a bias toward initially continuing to pay down our overall debt balance.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "[Obviously] I\u2019m trying to back you into giving an EBITDA guidance for next year essentially because if you got \u2026", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I might avoid it.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Yeah, I know, but I mean, so you can certainly do the math now, right? I mean you\u2019re basically saying that the total debt the way I\u2019m calculating this quarter was about $7.375 billion. You\u2019ve generate 375 of cash roughly in the fourth quarter to get to the free cash flow full-year roughly. So if you\u2019re at $7 billion going into next year and you generate say 450 mid-point, you\u2019re down to 655 for the year divided by three, it\u2019s implying EBITDA next year slightly below 2.2.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yeah.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "And I just want to make sure that\u2019s \u2013 for me person that\u2019s a little bit lower, but I am thinking for \u201913, so I\u2019m just trying to make sure you\u2019re not backing into something, you\u2019re not trying to imply?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "No we\u2019re certainly not trying to imply a specific number certainly not that low, right. You look at the S-4 data that we put out earlier this year. If you just add those, the RSC and the URI together plus synergies I think you get a number that\u2019s beyond 2.2, so that\u2019s certainly not what we\u2019re trying to imply. I think there are a huge number of assumptions that we would have to guide you to in order to get to the right number and that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to avoid that discussion right here now because there are just too many assumptions to walk down that road.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Okay. So we\u2019ll leave it wherever it is, either a movement in the $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow and/or if that\u2019s what you generate in cash you\u2019ll be below at three times. All right, so if the EBITDA is above 2.2 and you generate that cash you\u2019re below three times total debt-to-EBITDA \u2013 I mean, its kind of leave it as that, right? You\u2019re not implying below 2.2 of EBITDA next year?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "We are not implying an EBITDA of that level.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Okay, just making sure. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thanks, David.", "David Raso - International Strategy and Investment Group", "Bye, bye.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Hey, good morning guys. I just have a high level question for you Mike. It feels like the RSC deal has kind of really steered the pot in the industry. I guess with almost six months under your belt, I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re seeing competitors respond to the deal. Specifically any color on how industry pricing has been impacted, the prospects for future consolidation or just how competitors maybe thinking about fleet growth going forward?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yeah well I will tell you \u2013 I think if you \u2013 obviously you\u2019ve been hearing from all the other competitors that are out there publicly and those of that public debt out there, their rates all have been improving and also its supported by Rouse what he\u2019s been \u2013 he recently had a call I think yesterday with one of the analyst. So that supports that data that overall the industry is improving on price. So that continues to grow.", "With regards to the way people are putting their fleet in, I think each one has their own strategy on where they\u2019re going and what they\u2019re trying to do. Each one is completely different. When you look at what we are doing, we said we\u2019re going to focus on diversifying our customer mix, our portfolio and we\u2019ve done that. And then we\u2019re enhancing that, we\u2019re growing across our footprint.", "We have the broadest footprint, that\u2019s one of our \u2013 what I believe is a significant advantage for United Rentals particularly with larger accounts and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on, and we\u2019re utilizing the best of both worlds between both organizations and growing on that. Does that mean we have competitors in certain markets? Yeah absolutely, but on balance, I think that the industry is still reeling back from the declines of \u201909 on the rate and they haven\u2019t really levered-up or I should say levered-up or brought a lot of fleet in as if yet, I think it\u2019s still challenging for a lot of smaller tier players to get access to capital. It\u2019s better than it was, but not where it was before the downturn.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "So I guess with respect to the last part on the fleet growth side. Is it your expectation and that industry fleet growth is going to be somewhat muted next year?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "That's hard for me to say. I don\u2019t know what happens in the credit market, if things get opened up, I don't know. It\u2019s hard for me to call. I can only tell you what Bill mentioned, how we\u2019re thinking about the world and what we\u2019re focused on.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc", "Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "You\u2019re welcome.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.", "Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "Good morning, guys.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Good morning.", "William B. Plummer", "Good morning.", "Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "One thing I wanted to do is just kind of clarify what specifically changed relative to your previous expectation on the synergy front. You were able to get 12 up to 100 million for cost synergies and now, the fully developed range of 230 on the cost side \u2013 moving up from 230 to 250 on the cost side?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure. This is Matt. We \u2013 first of all for the accelerated achievement of the branch closures and some of the other corporate savings that we\u2019ve got that guided us to the $100 million for this year. As far as for the top end of the range, we are starting to see that there may be more opportunity and some of the central dispatching we are doing, some of the branch efficiencies I mentioned earlier about the productivity improvements in some of our larger scale facilities and we think that there is some upside there that we are going to get at and we should definitely be able to get at before our fully developed plan in 2014.", "Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on utilization, I mean, I was noticing for fleet mix that aerials ticked down sequentially as a percentage of your fleet. Was there any impact there on utilizations or anything else based on fleet mix that you would want to call out?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "This is Mike. I\u2019d tell you that it has some effect over time. It\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t look at it that way, but it\u2019s a valid point. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re expanding what we call the other, inside of that you would see the power side, the trench side, and the tool side because we are going to leverage our footprint. We are going to leverage the relationships that we\u2019ve and expand the expertise that RSC brings to the table.", "So to some degree you will see some changes. I think when we do our investor presentation, we will try to give a better view on what that would look like. It\u2019s too early. We're going through it and we\u2019re trying to see what the opportunities are. We know they\u2019re there and we are actually investing so that we can capitalize on it.", "Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thanks, Nick.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks and congratulations on the quarter.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thank you.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks, George.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "You've noted time utilization has been improving sequentially over the past four months, reaching just slightly north of 72% so far in October. Could you give us color on what\u2019s driving the improvement and whether you expect these factors to persist?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure, George. This is Matt. I think what has driven the improvement is demand first and foremost, but we\u2019ve also moved further away from those closures that started towards the end of June and as Mike stated, we are really ramped up between July and August and we're starting to move away from that.", "So, our team is much more focused on trying to grow revenue versus our early focus candidly was making sure we stabilized the base business. So, I think that\u2019s given us some tailwind in time utilization.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yeah, I will also add that I made the comment \u2013 in my opening comments about penetration. Penetration to me is one of the drivers in the industry. It\u2019s also a seasonality. The third quarter is always our strongest, so we did see it build up and as Matt mentioned \u2013 as we mentioned in the call \u2013 in our results that we did have a disruption. But there is a seasonal trend, but when you step back away there is a shift towards rental penetration.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yep.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Hi, Phil.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I was hoping you could walk me through the different components of what changed in your free cash flow guidance from previously being negative $90 million to $140 million to now being negative $25 million to $75 million, is that just better EBITDA and less net CapEx or is there some interest savings there? Could you just walk us through the pieces?", "William B. Plummer", "Yeah, Phil. The biggest drivers are in working capital and CapEx. Working capital we \u2013 as I said earlier, we \u2013 we've revised our expectation about the impact of shortening the payment terms for fleet purchases for what we buy for RSC, that was probably the biggest factor. And then we are working at the lower end of our CapEx range and that contributed a little bit more as well. So, those were the two predominant drivers.", "There is a little bit of a benefit from profitability improvement as we started to realize a little bit more in the way of synergies, but it\u2019s CapEx and working capital, the big drivers.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. And Bill if I could sneak a second one in there, earlier you gave guidance for 2013 in terms of CapEx, but you talked about gross. Can you talk about on a net basis, if possible?", "William B. Plummer", "So, earlier I was talking about gross. Net is probably not going to be dramatically different than this year either. We are on target to realize new sales proceeds somewhere around $440 million and it\u2019s probably going to be something like that again next year.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thank you.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Hi, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Bill can you talk about how monthly rates you\u2019re signing today compared to prior cycle highs? I think spot rates are back at prior cycle highs and I\u2019m wondering if your new monthly businesses as well, if you can give us a broad update? Thanks.", "William B. Plummer", "So without the specifics here in front of me, Jerry, I do know that what you call spot rates are \u2013 let\u2019s call it what we call it, our daily rates are already above the prior cycle highs. The weekly rates are about at the prior peak and we're still below on the monthly rates, somewhere in the neighborhood of 7% below the prior peak. So, some room to go on the monthlies to get to the prior peak.", "Whenever people raise this point though, I always have to ask the question, why does the prior peak matter? Is the prior peak some kind of physical law that limits where rates can go? We don\u2019t believe so. That was five years ago and the environment is different now and so, I think it\u2019s interesting to talk about where we are versus the peak. I don\u2019t know that it really defines where we can go though in the future.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, so the question is from the standpoint of understanding how much room the monthlies have to catch up because obviously they roll on a delayed basis, so I\u2019m assuming the 7% number you mentioned is the entire book of monthly business and I\u2019m wondering if you are comfortable commenting on the monthly business that you are signing today not the overall book?", "William B. Plummer", "No. That\u2019s the monthly rate that we\u2019re experiencing today compared to what we experienced back in the early part of \u201907.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And in terms of thinking about the timing of the CapEx spend over 2013; I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us more context there? Earlier this year you mentioned that you because of how front half weighted the CapEx budget was there were some utilization pressure, I\u2019m just wondering how that factors into your timing decision of when to pick deliveries next year and how should we think about utilizations heading into next year, first quarter looks like a pretty tough comp. So I\u2019m wondering and if you could just provide some broader brush comments to the extent you are comfortable on those topics? Thanks.", "William B. Plummer", "Yeah. Just, I think next year you will see timing of our CapEx that\u2019s more normal. There was a specific strategy behind front-end loading of the CapEx this year and I don\u2019t know Matt if you want to flush that out a little bit?", "Matthew Flannery", "Yeah. We did a big pre-buy of multitude reasons last year and we won\u2019t need to do all of that this year and we won\u2019t need the timing to be the same. If projects accelerate and demand peaks up we will always hold the right to adjust, but I don\u2019t think it will be as frontloaded next year.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Jerry just on your comment about the time utilization next year, we will try to give some guidance later on and during our investor presentation on the fourth. But to your point on the seasonal swing, we did have a very mild winter. I don't know what that is going to deal with us this year, but on balance we will continue to strive to expand it.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS. Your question please.", "Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank", "Hey, good morning. It's actually Eric Crawford on for Henry.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Hi. How are you?", "Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank", "Hey, good. Thanks. Bigger picture on time utilization, once you get past the branch consolidations, adjust the fleet mix and the business mix, what\u2019s the ideal time utilization for the new URI? What\u2019s the right range for the business post transformation?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "You know that\u2019s \u2013 I think an earlier question we had was around the same thing and we are going to kind of give some guidance. We have to go through, we\u2019re going to take a look at what is coming in from the \u2013 all of the regions on what capital they want to spend. As I mentioned before, we are expanding into the trench, the other side of the business, the tools as well as the power, which historically runs at lower time utilization with very nice returns.", "So as we go through our business process, and our budget process, we are going to take a look at that and then we are going to come back on the fourth and give you some guidance. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s going to change dramatically because there is still opportunities we think in specific markets and areas that we can do better, but you can look forward on the fourth.", "Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just a point of clarification on the rates, how they trended through the quarter?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "They \u2013 for July, they were up 7.5%, for August, they were up 8%, and for September, 7.1%.", "Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thank you.", "William B. Plummer", "Let me just tack on to that real quickly. So that gave us the 7.5% year-over-year rate that we realized for the quarter, on our way to 7% for the full-year. I just wanted \u2013 I think there is \u2013 I\u2019ve heard people talk about fourth quarter year-over-year rate realization and I\u2019ve heard some pretty interesting numbers. So just to be clear, we think about the fourth quarter year-over-year rate realization needed to get to that 7% for the full-year as being about 6%. I\u2019ve heard some numbers that were significantly higher than that and I just wanted to make sure that everyone heard it here that we are thinking of fourth quarter year-over-year of about 6%.", "Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yilma Abebe from J.P. Morgan. Your question please.", "Yilma Abebe - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. I was hoping if you could comment on how you\u2019re looking at an overall credit risk and leverage specifically. The 2.5 to 3 times leverage target that you have, how does that compare in terms of the Company, it looked that leverage pre-recession as a standalone company. I was hoping if you can put this 2.5 to 3 times in historical context for us?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, sure. We used to talk about the preferred leverage range being in the 3.5 to 4.5 times range and certainly 2.5 to 3.5 represents a shift in our thinking there. To give some context during the absolute depth of the recession in 2009, we peaked up just above 5 times on a trailing \u201912 EBITDA basis. Clearly in the extreme, a higher leverage than we would want in our normal range. But that gives you a little bit of context of where we\u2019ve been over the last number of years. So, 2.5 to 3.5 times is fundamentally different and I think it reflects our view that we want to maintain a reasonable level of leverage to make for very efficient capital structure. But we don\u2019t want to go too far because you lose that advantage as you go too low in leverage.", "On the other side, you don\u2019t want to get too high because it really does amplify the volatility and cash flow and returns that we have from the business and that\u2019s something that hurts the returns for equity investors and makes the debt investors \u2013 puts them in a riskier position as well.", "Yilma Abebe - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "So if I can add on to that, so \u2013 why do you have a lower \u2013 what\u2019s the driver behind a lower target in terms of leverage based on [multiple] context? May I know, why have you reduced that target, if you can give a little bit context on some of the drivers behind this lower leverage target now?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I think we \u2013 again, it\u2019s about reducing the volatility of our results, so overall is an important driver for why we want to target a lower range. It will solidify our access to debt financing, although it\u2019s pretty good right here now, but we want to make even more sure that we got free access to debt financing. It will reduce the volatility and cash flow and equity returns and that should make the equity more attractive. And it just gives us a firmer foundation for driving the strategy of the Company, whether we grow organically, whether we position ourselves for further acquisitions, it's all held by the somewhat lower leverage. So that was \u2013 those were the main drivers of the thought process.", "Yilma Abebe - J.P. Morgan Securities LLC", "Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I want to make sure that everyone goes onto our website to see our latest Investor Relation presentation. I had some new slides out there that hopefully you will find helpful. It talks more about the business and how we\u2019re seeing the world and we look forward to talking to you again on December 4th at our Investor Day.

The company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control and consequently actual results may differ materially from those projected. A summary of these uncertainties is indicated in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 as well as subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company\u2019s website at www.ur.com.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.", "You should also note that today\u2019s call will include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term. Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer and William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer and Matthew Flannery, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone, and welcome. With me today as operated stated is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer and other members of our senior management team.", "Typically on the fourth quarter call, I\u2019ll summarize the key results and then turn to the coming year and I know this is all adventurous in our operating and volume and we\u2019ll certainly address that today. But I also want to touch on the broader invocations of our fourth quarter results. 2012 as you know it, was not a typical year for us and I think it\u2019s important to view the quarter in that light. First, the results we reported were clearly strong finish to a very good financial year, a year which we transformed the company for superior returns.", "In addition to the merger with RSC, we\u2019re also successful executing our strategy in an expanding marketplace. Second, the numbers reflect a substantial progress, we made on the integration for the beneficial effect on margin and the alignment of our operations is now largely complete and we\u2019re working together as one.", "Bear in mind that the merger happened less than a year ago and we realized some significant efficiencies in the brief time. In the fourth quarter, we captured another $42 million of cost synergies bringing the total to $104 million for the year. Before I recap the numbers, I\u2019ll remind you that any year-over-year comparisons I give you are on a pro forma basis, as measure against the combined results of the United Rentals and RSC for 2011.", "On the top line, our rental revenue for the quarter was up about 90% year-over-year and total revenue was up more than 7%. Our adjusted EBITDA was $553 million for the quarter and a 44% margin, that\u2019s 580 basis points higher than the same period last year. And our flow through was a very robust 125% for the quarter. These results stand on their own, but they become even more meaningful as a part of our trend towards superior performance.", "Now, over the past year, as you know we\u2019ve used these calls to explain how we\u2019re becoming more discipline in running the business from value creation and each quarter the poof was in numbers and the fourth quarter was no different.", "A number of factors worked in our favor including a modest improvement in the construction environment in 2012, a continuing trend toward market penetration, which is increasing the size of the industry pie, and a robust user core market.", "Now within our won company, we had a more balanced mix of rental revenue with non-construction accounting for about 50% of our business and effective focus on key accounts with the application of our technology for their needs. A 7% increase in the volume of in our rent and a 6% increase in our rates we charged for our equipment.", "Time utilization was 68.7% which although lower than last year was still very strong in our much larger fleet and the ongoing optimization or our field operations, in the fourth quarter, we closed 14 branches, nearly all of them merger related.", "So we had a mix of factors, most of which were created to our own networks and some presented by the microenvironment. But in every case, we were intensely opportunistic and making these factors work to our advantage. And in the final months of 2012, our regions were still dealing with the tail end of the integration, but even so, they turned in very solid performance.", "13 of our 14 regions had year-over-year growth in rental revenue for the quarter and 13 regions had year-over-year increase in rental rates. Of those 13, a 11 regions had a quarterly sequential rate increases, so demand held up going into the off season. Rental revenues from key accounts grew 14% year-over-year and within that group, national accounts grew 16%.", "Another shining star was our trend, safety, power in HVAC business. It had an extremely strong quarter. Revenue from specially rentals grew 37% reflecting demand for construction, industrial and emergency response application. So, that\u2019s a quick snapshot, and Matt is here and we available during our Q&A to answer any questions about our field operations and the integration.", "I want to talk to you about 2013 and give you our insights. As you saw our outlook, we\u2019re projecting strong growth in both revenues and adjusted EBITDA and very strong free cash flow. Our expectations for rates and utilization are in line with demand that we\u2019re seeing for our services. And we feel confident that we can drive more improvement in rates, while increasing time utilization year-over-year. And we plan to do this, while investing over $1 billion of net rental CapEx to our fleet.", "A several years ago during the worst of the downturn, it was extremely difficult to plan our current market conditions. And we\u2019re operating in a very murky economy, but to a lesser degree that\u2019s still true. Nevertheless our projections for 2012 were on the money and that puts exactly where we expected to be in 2013.", "Now the end markets that are showing signs of growth, especially in oil and gas and power sectors and we see continued trend toward secular penetration driven by the growing appreciation for the economic benefits are raining and we have a broader deeper value proposition that we can now bring to market.", "Time and again, our senior customers come to the realization that they\u2019re wasting money by owning fleet that sits idle. And these customers see rental as a sound business strategy, which should continue to elevate demand and the recovery.", "Now if you with us on our Investor Day in December, you know that we feel that we\u2019re still in a very early stage for a meaningful recovery. The macro consensus seems to be in line with global insight, which estimates the U.S. equipment rental industry to grow by 8% in 2013 and by 11% in 2014. In private non-res construction, which accounts for half of our business is projected to grow about 6% in the U.S. in 2013 with accelerated growth in 2014 and we think these are all reasonable forecasts and are supported by our own customer surveys as well as surveys from other sources that serve in the same markets as we do.", "Also we agree with forecasters who think most of the market momentum in 2013 will come in the back half of the year. This is all good news, but I\u2019ll reinforce something I\u2019ve said in the past, we believe our strategy, our scale and our customer service will keep us growing faster than our end markets.", "And I want to spend a minute on customer service because it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re very serious about service as a differentiator. We know the attributes of great service are in the rental business, and we\u2019ve built up a lot of credibility by focusing on those attributes. We track them at branch, district and region levels through metrics that measured customer service, fleet management and process efficiencies. And if a branch starts to slip on its on-time delivery, a manager knows it very quickly or if a district is having with the particular metric, are people who are on it. We also have companywide goals in 2013, like a more streamline rental process and a metric called OEC unavailable for rent and we\u2019re very focused on improving that number. We are also running a tight ship when it comes to the safety. And I\u2019m proud to say that we had a full year pro forma recordable rate of 1.4 for 2012 and that\u2019s our best safety record performance yet.", "Moreover 84% of our branches had zero recordables for the year and as far as we know that\u2019s the best safety record in the industry, and we\u2019re going to keep driving all of our branches towards zero. So what else you see from us in 2013, great question. You will see us continue to focus on technology including total control system or identifying key accounts, we can benefit total control to help them lower their equipment costs. You also see us rule out the mature model to more markets. This model uses dedicated repair hubs and essentially managed field services to improve our margins in high density areas.", "We now have 20 successful implementations of our mature model in cities in Toronto and San Diego. With another 20 \u2013 excuse me another 15 or so planned for this year. We also go hard after remain of the synergies targeted, when we merge with RSC and we continue to expect we will reach a fully developed run rate between $230 million and $250 million of cost synergies in 2014 and we have plans to reduce our leverage that Bill will discuss.", "The operating cash flow characteristics of our business are very strong and the timing of the merger has dovetailed nicely with market projections. So, when our favorable position reduced our leverage. Most important you will see us continue to deliver on our promise of improved profitability and higher margins. We just with our Branch Managers at our annual management meeting in Minneapolis earlier this month. Our managers are energized by the merger and hungry for growth. I think we all came away from that meeting that we are ready to take on the world.", "One year ago, I stood here and told you that 2012 was not just about the deals we would make or the forecast we put out there. I said about we are delivering on our promise and to drive returns and you saw us deliver on that promise in 2012. Now, the bar is still higher and the stakes are bigger. And you can expect us to deliver again on 2013.", "Now, I close in that thought, and return it over to Bill for the financial results and then after that we\u2019ll take your questions. So, now over to you, Bill.", "Bill Plummer", "Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone. As always, I\u2019ll try to add a little bit more color to the quarter and the year that we just reported and also spend a little bit more time on our guidance for 2013. But before I get started, let me just remind everyone what Michael said that all of our discussion here is about our pro forma forecasted or actual performance, anything that\u2019s not pro forma, we\u2019ll call out as we go through.", "So, let me start with our rental revenue performance for the quarter, up 8.7% year-over-year with good contributions from rate and volume as always. Rates were up 6% over the comparable quarter last year, and they were up eight-tenths of a percent sequentially versus third quarter of 2012. That brought us to a full year rental rate performance of 6.9%, very consistent with our guidance of about 70%.", "If you look at volume and time utilization, we had nice growth in overall volume in the year; what we see on rent, which is our measured volume was up 7.2% in the quarter, to an average of $5 billion of OEC on rent, clearly reflecting what is an overall strong demand environment and certainly reflecting the investment that we\u2019ve been putting in our fleet over the last year, year and half or so.", "Time utilization on that OEC on rent was 68.7% in the quarter and that by any measure a very strong level of utilization for the fourth quarter. It certainly consisted with the demand that we\u2019ve seen, consistent with the ability to deliver price and certainly is a focus of how we manage our business. It is down 90 basis points from the fourth quarter of the prior year, but I\u2019ll remind everyone that that\u2019s less of a year-over-year decline than what we have seen in the prior couple of quarters. And again, we remind you of the discussion that we\u2019ve had about the impact of the integration, the branch consolidations that we\u2019ve gone through, we are continuing to call back our leveraging of the fleet from that upheaval and we\u2019re making very good progress and I think that \u2013 that\u2019s smaller decline in year-over-year utilization demonstrates that.", "For the full year, our time utilization was 57.5% and that was down only 30 basis points from 2011 and again I\u2019ll remind you that, that was on a larger fleet. The overall fleet, average fleet size for 2012 was up about 12% or roughly $770 million of incremental fleet and certainly putting that to work very effectively explains that 67.5% utilization across the year.", "Before I move on to the profitability, just a word on our used equipment sales results for the quarter. We had a very strong quarter and indeed a very strong year for used equipment sales. In the quarter, we generated a $141 million of proceeds from used sales, had a very robust 39.7% adjusted gross margin and again that\u2019s the adjusted margin excluding the impact of the step-up in basis due to the merger accounting.", "The margin reflects really a very, very strong performance in the channel mix. We had a great year as we drove more of our sales through our retail channel, 56% of our sales in the quarter were through our retail channel and that\u2019s up almost six percentage points from that channel share last year and you all know that we get our best results in that retail channels. So, great success there, we\u2019re having great success in accessing overall used equipment demand and that certainly portends well for our used sales going forward, which will continue to be robust.", "Let me move now to profitability and start there with adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $553 million, and that was at a margin of 44.3%, so that represents an improvement of the $104 million of absolute EBITDA dollars. And that\u2019s 580 basis points better in margin than the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA came in at a $1.988 billion. And the margin for the full year was 42.6%. For that full year, that represents almost $500 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA, $490 million and 650 basis points more in margin than the same period in 2011, full year 2011.", "Flow-through for the quarter, which we defined is the change in adjusted EBITDA divided by the change in total revenue. Flow-through was an outstanding 125% for the quarter. If you look at the full year, we had another great result in flow-through, 93% flow-through for the full year.", "Then margin and flow-through performance overall reflects the strong and great environment clearly, but also obviously reflects the impacts of the synergies that we realized from the integration. Even if you exclude the synergies though, the flow-through story is still pretty robust. So, flow-through still had 74% impact in the quarter, if you exclude the synergies. And for the full year, it\u2019s comparable about 73% flow-through for the full year if you exclude the synergies that we realized in the course of the year.", "If you move down to EPS on a profit basis, our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.27 and it\u2019s worth pointing out that $1.27 reflects an underlying tax rate that was just under 30%, 29.5% to be precise. If you look at our GAAP, tax provision for the quarter, you see that we actually reported a tax benefit of about 5% on a GAAP basis, but that benefit is really driven by the effect of a couple of key items in the quarter.", "So, we had, you all know a refinancing of our 10, seven, eight notes during the course of the quarter and we reported a loss for the premium pay to refinance that issue, that loss was recognized in the United States as a deduction and therefore push down the U.S. pre-tax income very significantly and our tax \u2013 our effective tax rate as result mix more significantly toward Canada, which you all know has a lower tax rate.", "So, that was a very significant mix impact that drove down the underlying tax rate on a GAAP basis, but it was further exacerbated by the fact that we had favorable settlements of tax audits really around the states and in particular in Canada during the quarter. So the discreet items there were very, very favorable for the tax impact in the quarter and that was a significant part of driving that 5% tax benefit in the quarter.", "All in all though the EPS performance on yield basis is pretty strong. As I said, the $1.27 reflects about a 30% tax rate even if you wanted to use the 35% tax rate, our view of adjusted EPS would still be in that $1.17, $1.18 area. So, a good strong EPS performance.", "Let me move to integration just briefly and talk about the $42 million of synergies that we realized in the quarter, a very robust integration performance that has been the case and we believe, we\u2019re comfortably on track to deliver what we\u2019ve talked about is $230 million to $250 million of fully developed cost synergies. And the contributions were pretty solid across all the different areas of synergy deliver in the fourth quarter. So, the $42 million brought us to $104 million. As Mike said, our synergies in the fourth quarter and it sets this up very nicely to continue to drive those synergies through 2013.", "Before I move to the outlook for 2013, let me just touch on free cash flow and capital structure and liquidity briefly. Free cash flow, this is the only measure that, that I\u2019ll talk about. That\u2019s not pro-forma adjusted. We report free cash flow on an as reported basis and that number came in for the full year at $223 million of cash usage.", "Keep in mind \u2013 excuse me, keep in mind that includes the impact of all the restructuring and merger related payments that we made in cash. That impact was about a $150 million at cash. So, if you net out the $150 million of merger related cost, we had a free cash flow usage of $73 million for the year and that is within the range that we guided to between minus $25 million and minus $75 million for the full year.", "Turn to our capital structure and liquidity. We finished the year with the total of $782 million with total liquidity, within that $654 million was ABL capacity and the remainder was cash and our AR facility and I remind everyone that as I mentioned just a couple of minutes, during the quarter we redeemed our 10 (inaudible) notes and incurred a significant interest expense charge to do that, roughly $72 million was the impact that played through our P&L.", "Before we move to Q&A just on 2013 outlook, just briefly. Since Mike hit the high numbers just a little color. We put the revenue on the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, that\u2019s total revenue. Within that the rental revenue performance we expect to be driven by our rental rate expectation at 4.5% year-over-year that includes a carryover impact in where we finished 2012 of about 2%.", "For time utilization, we are expecting about 68% for the year, that\u2019s a 50 basis point in improvement for the year and again continues to reflect the focus that we put on driving our utilization performance. Reducing the fleet unavailable for rent as Mike pointed out will be an important focus there and certainly that will help us drive utilization more effectively without having to invest capital underneath it.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the year, we expect to be between $2.250 billion and $2.350 billion for the year so midpoint of $2.3 billion. Our net rental capital expenditures, we expect to be just over a $1 billion, a $1.50 billion and that reflects roughly $1.5 billion of gross rental CapEx and the difference being proceeds from used sales.", "Full year free cash flow for the year, we expect to be between $400 million and $500 million and as we\u2019ve discussed in the past we\u2019ll use that primarily to reduce our leverage. On leverage we certainly expect a significant move during the course of 2013, we\u2019re right now saying that based on the guidance that we\u2019re providing that we should finish the year at right about three times debt to EBITDA and it will be that number whether we use any of the cash proceeds to finish out our share repurchase program or not. So a very nice deleveraging coming during the course of 2013.", "Those are the key points that I would make right here and now there are plenty of other topics that we can talk about in Q&A. So certainly look forward to your questions, we can move to that now. Operator, let\u2019s open it for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Set Weber from RBC Capital. Your question please.", "Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Mike Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Bill Plummer", "Good morning.", "Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital", "I just wanted to get a sense for how committed you are to holding the line on this $1 billion net CapEx number. What sort of the optimal mix here if you can get 68.5% utilization and keep the 4.5% rate, I mean would that trigger a higher CapEx number or how are you thinking about the balance there, because your 68% number would actually be above what you\u2019ve done the last couple of years.", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah, this is Mike. I\u2019ll answer at this way. Look we are trying to drive profitable growth, if I were to see both rate and time, start to accelerate, I have no hesitation to spend more, but I would like to see the both of those come into play. And the other thing is I would say is that \u2013 a lot of free cash flow and we\u2019ve got a lot of blue-sky in order to meet customer demand.", "Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital", "I mean as you\u2019re looking at your guidance, would you think that there is more relative upside to the rate number or to the utilization and which would push \u2013 would you prefer to push rate I guess versus utilization if you had a choice.", "Mike Kneeland", "I think you know me. I would tell you that obviously rate is near and dear to my heart has the biggest flow through and the highest potential for our margin expansion. And I think that, that\u2019s a fair statement. So, rate I think, if you go back last year, we started out the year saying 2005, we ended up just here underneath 2007. We will continue to focus on it. We are going to continue to drive it and I think the team is low equipped. We got tools. As I stated in my opening comments, we\u2019re now a unit as one and we\u2019re going to focus on that.", "Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital", "And are you seeing anything from a competitive standpoint, are the smaller independent guys refleeting or they becoming more aggressive with pricing or is everybody kind of being rational here?", "Matt Flannery", "Hey Set, this is Matt. Overall, I think everybody is being very rational. And you know the national players are in much the same mode that we are and I think the rest of the industry is following suit and that\u2019s good for the entire industry. So, I\u2019m very comfortable and encouraged by that.", "Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital", "I mean, but do you get the sense, the smaller guys are refleeting or they based on capital constrained.", "Matt Flannery", "No, I\u2019ve not seen a trend there at all.", "Set Weber \u2013 RBC Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much guys.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group. Your question please.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, good morning.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi, David.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "Two bigger picture questions. You keep referring to global insights outlook for 2013, but the guidance you\u2019re giving appears to be no better than the industry outlook, so I\u2019m just trying to see how you\u2019re framing the year end, you keep referring to your ability to penetrate and take share but your guidance is really only in line with \u2013 that seems like how you\u2019re viewing the industry. So, can you just sit back for a second and explain us why you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to outgrow the industry this year?", "Mike Kneeland", "I think David, the way which we look at the world, you can parse out the numbers however you want but we believe that we\u2019re going to outpace the industry this year. As I stated, and I continue to state whether it\u2019s driving profitable growth, but don\u2019t lose focus on the fact that our key accounts and our national accounts grew at very nice numbers and those are the areas that we continue to focus on, and you\u2019re going to see us put more effort on growing that segment of the business.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "I\u2019m trying to backdoor and to build town as the rental revenue growth for the year, because if you look at the implied used equipment sales, which is obviously the second biggest driver to your revenues, that implied to be up nearly 13%. Total revenues were implied only up 7%. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel are we thinking that rental revenues were up, 7, 8, 9, and 10, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for that, and then the segue question is, we\u2019re implying the core incremental EBITDA margins, forget about the synergies, dropping at 1,000 basis points year-over-year from roughly 73, 74, down to an implied 63. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for why are the incremental margins be 1,000 basis points lower and again why the rental revenue, maybe it\u2019s not faster than the industry, but if you can help us in any way with those two questions it would be appreciated.", "Bill Plummer", "So, David, it\u2019s Bill. What I would say on the rental revenue growth is, it\u2019s at a certain level, it\u2019s a systematical question about outperform the industry.", "We do have a rental revenue growth within that center point $5 billion revenue number that we gave. That is an excess of anything that we\u2019ve heard from forecasting services for the industry in the year and we haven\u2019t given the exact number, but you can back into it reasonably close. I think you would have to know a little bit more about our assumptions for contractor supplies new equipment and so on in order to get super-precise. But we feel very comfortable in saying that we will outperform the industry in the year and that\u2019s what underlies that guidance.", "In terms of the flow-through performance and the change versus last year, we view 63% as being very robust flow-through performance when you exclude the impact of synergies. That\u2019s \u2013 if you look back over the history of the company and the industry, I think you have to say that \u2013 that\u2019s a good level of performance, it is as good as the 73,74 range that we were in 2012, clearly not, but I think what we got in 2012, it\u2019s hard to imagine that you\u2019re going to be able to sustain forever.", "We don\u2019t have as much rate realization assumed for 2013 as we actually had in 2012. That backs off the flow-through impact.", "We aren\u2019t putting as much fleet in on a percentage basis in 2013 as we did in 2012 and you know the benefit of flowing more fleets through the fixed cost basis pretty significant. So, that would back off your flow-through in 2013. So, when you start parsing through the things that \u2013 that we wouldn\u2019t have there on our 2013 forecast, compared to what we had in 2012. It\u2019s not shocking to me that our flow through ex-synergies would be down and we can have a robust debate about how much they should be down. But we feel good about 63% ex-synergies based on what we expect for the year.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "Yeah. I\u2019m not denying to get absolute numbers. I was just wondering, you closed 187 stores over six months stretch. I have to believe that would hurt the flow through to some degree. But I guess you\u2019re seeing the other items, you cited more than offset the positives of 2013 won\u2019t have those branch closures?", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah. I think along with the branch closures, there were variety of activities going on. I\u2019ll tell you, one of the things that benefited 2012 for example is as you\u2019re going through those consolidations and figuring out new responsibilities and how things are going to work, there is a level of uncertainty that\u2019s introduced the cost \u2013 some people to say, you know what? I\u2019m going to hold off on adding head count even though, I know that I might need to add head count.", "So, in that environment, ex-synergies \u2013 you might actually be operating a little bit understaffed relative to where you otherwise should be. That\u2019s not going to be as much of an impact in 2013. At least we\u2019re not forecasting it to be. And so that\u2019s part of the story that causes ex-synergy flow through the back half a little big. But please don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that 63% is still pretty good.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "No, that\u2019s all fair. Right, I appreciate it. And quickly just on tax rate for 2013?", "Mike Kneeland", "We\u2019re saying the upper half of the 30s. So, 35, 36, 37, in that area.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group", "Thank you very much.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc. Your question please.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Mike Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc", "Mike, question for you on your metro model. I think you mentioned earlier that you\u2019re looking at about 20 current implementations and then maybe another 15 or so this year. I guess, one is that full opportunity and two, what percentage of your overall markets might fit within this type of model?", "Mike Kneeland", "I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m going to ask him, because he\u2019s deeply involved in it. So, Matt?", "Matt Flannery", "Great. Joe it\u2019s \u2013 so, it\u2019s 20 that are already implemented and another 15 that we\u2019ve got planned to rollout. There\u2019s probably another 10 to 12 after that. If you look at branch count, which \u2013 it is necessarily tied the revenue, it\u2019s about 50% of our footprint. It is condensed enough to take opportunities of shared services that the Metro Model offers. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question, but we\u2019ve been encouraged by the results of the models we had, and obviously the longer ones, and ones that have been in place in early first quarter 2012 have significantly better metrics than the company average. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by that.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc", "That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s perfect. And then I know at your Analyst Day you talked about one to three points of EBITDA improvements from this. Is that still fitting for the some of the other markets, did you plan to roll this out this out too?", "Mike Kneeland", "Yes. So we\u2019re not certain yet, but if we \u2013 if we make the assumption that we took the biggest opportunities first, which would be a safe assumption, we\u2019ve probably frontloaded that and some of the additional markets that we rollout, you don\u2019t have as much density in. So, the scale may have some effect on where you\u2019re going to fall between that 1% to 3% range, but we expect to be in that range.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc", "Excellent. Maybe one more for you real quick. Can you just dig into some of the moving pieces that would drive upside or downside to the 4.5% of rental rate guidance? And maybe just to add to that, it looks like both used and new equipment prices are well above the prior peak as opposed to the rental rates that are still below. How does new and used price play into your ability to raise rental rates, and I guess, is it normal for rental rates to lag this for behind?", "Mike Kneeland", "So \u2013 to your last question, I don\u2019t feel that the new used pricing really has an effect on our rental rate whatsoever. It\u2019s in the big scheme of things, it\u2019s not a driver for the \u2013 for end users, so the rental still such an attractive value versus all the cost that come along with owning, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s part of a decision process.", "Your first question was about 4.5% rate, and if I recall what the opportunity is, we\u2019ve pegged 4.5, because that\u2019s it we think. If you look at the 2% carryover that we referred too, and then the figure at first quarter, some of the middle quarters are where we have our opportunity, we make some sequential assumptions that get us to that 4.5% rate that we are very comfortable with. If the demand picks up sooner, Mike had said earlier, the second half of the year we feel stronger. If we see the demand in the first half of the year increase more than we\u2019ve forecasted, we will \u2013 I think we have proven in the past, we won\u2019t hold off on getting that opportunity. And that can very well show up in rate.", "Yeah, the other thing I would say just \u2013 look we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as we possibly can. We\u2019re trying to make sure that everyone can try to look at how we see the world and the metrics to go behind the revenue that we\u2019re putting out there. So to the extent, it\u2019s a balancing act as Matt mentioned and we are going to continue to drive rate, it\u2019s \u2013 this is an industry that has to get over its cost of capital and to the cycle, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.", "Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc", "Sounds good. Thanks guys. Take care.", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research.", "Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research", "How are you doing?", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi, Nick.", "Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research", "I want to ask about the impact of Hurricane Sandy, is there anything you can quantify there.", "Matt Flannery", "Yeah, Nick this is Matt, we had in the fourth quarter about $6 million of revenue that was directly \u2013 was a result of the impact of Sandy. There is about a third of that, that remains on rent today. So not a large number. As far as forward looking the start have been now starting to come in as far as the construction planning starts now that the \u2013 the government since approved the funding specifically for the Jersey Shore, but we forecast maybe $20 million, $25 million of additional what we see on rent in those affected areas so it will be big in that in those communities and in that area and we\u2019ll play a big role, but we don\u2019t see it as a needle mover a big impact on the overall company\u2019s scale.", "Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then can you also give us rate by month on a year-over-year basis?", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah. Rates by month on a year-over-year for the month of October, it was 6.5%, for November it was 6.1% and for December it was 5.3% and for the full quarter it was 6% on a weighted average.", "Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research", "Okay. And can you tell us anything about how things are turning into January?", "Bill Plummer", "Yeah. I\u2019ll take that one, so January is tracking as we expected both for rate and fleet on rent and time utilization. It \u2013 it\u2019s started \u2013 I\u2019ll step back and say one of the things that you saw this year with Christmas being on a Tuesday as we saw the latter half of December, things softened up a little bit more than you normally would see, if Christmas were on a Monday or Friday or over the weekend so the second half of December was little softer. And so we started the year a little lower than we otherwise might have. But we\u2019ve called out all that back and so January is on pace both in terms of rate and in terms of getting fleet into the market and it feels pretty good at this point.", "Nick Coppola \u2013 Thompson Research", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Bill Plummer", "Thank you.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi, Ted.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Hi, guys. Congratulations on good quarter.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you, Ted.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Michael, I saw in come back to some of your comments about the end markets, I know you commented oil and gas and power were strong. Could you frame kind of were those strongest in 2012 and would you expect that to carry into 2013 as well or do you see other groups maybe improving in a relative basis and kind of maybe get a little more granular about the end markets based on the client surveys or the other metrics that you\u2019re looking at?", "Mike Kneeland", "I\u2019ll start with the client survey and it\u2019s a great point because our December survey of our customers, 62% of the key customers expect growth over 2012, which is up slightly from what we had in our last quarterly call. So, we take that as a takeaway from our customers\u2019 confidence level is \u2013 is beginning to rein bullish and we take that as a positive.", "With regard to some of the industries, the power sector is still an area, where we are \u2013 we participate in, in a broad sense and we think in 2012, it will continue in 2013. We could debate whether there is a pipeline, there is an half a lot of work is being done once we\u2019ve got all of the \u2013 all of the wells are drilled for natural gas and for wet gas. It\u2019s an efficient way of fuel and we see that demand.", "Bill Plummer", "We\u2019re also having a colder winter than last year. Unlike last year, there was more, one of pause, because there is oversupply of natural gas.", "Mike Kneeland", "And given that the temperatures that were \u2013 we are unfortunately going through right now, whether it\u2019s rather cold that\u2019s going to I think acerbate some of the demand or the need for that fuel in energy sector.", "Our power grid continues to be \u2013 needs to be refurbished, that\u2019s underway, and it\u2019s a long-term project. The same goes for coal and all of fossil fuel plants, their aging repairs ongoing, and then I would say that \u2013 one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is more investment in the chemical side of the business, particularly in the Southwest or in the Gulf area and from foreign investment coming in here, but stable, and we have lower energy prices. And so we\u2019re seeing more of that start to play out inside of our industry. Having said all that, I\u2019ll also point out that one area that we\u2019re looking at markets, we don\u2019t see there is a growth in Northeast Canada, it came off of high. It\u2019s still going to grow, but not at the rate we saw historically. Western Canada will remain strong and that\u2019s \u2013 hope I answered all of your questions.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Yeah, that is helpful. And in terms of \u2013 just I was hoping to next touch on the synergies for 2013, and I don\u2019t know if this is a Matt question or Bill question or Michael, but the guidance is for step up of, I think, $96 million. Could you help us understand what that allocation looks like between COGS and SG&A, and how the realizations in 2012 split between those two buckets?", "Mike Kneeland", "Ted, I\u2019ll take a stab at it, and Matt certainly feel free to chime in. So, as we look at what\u2019s to come in 2013, I would say there is a majority of it that comes in cost of rent, because it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s clearly become out of areas such as operational head count metrics that we track, delivery efficiencies that quite honestly we haven\u2019t recognized any synergies for as of yet, but we know that there are some benefits that are going on, we just got \u2013 get our heads around how do we capture them and calculate them. So the majority of that incremental 96 will be in the cost of rent lines of the company, that said we still don\u2019t have opportunities in SG&A. I think there is still some process changes to play out in some of the administrative areas, but it will be skewed toward cost of rent during 2013.", "We have been more heavily skewed toward SG&, savings so far in the $104 million that we realized in 2012, and that\u2019s just natural, right. A lot of it came out of reducing redundancies in the corporate functions, reducing sort of the management structure in the field and we\u2019ve done a nice job of that, it\u2019s gone very well. The stuff yet to be is going to be more \u2013 is the hardest stuff quite honestly, but stuff that\u2019s more directly tied to operation.", "Matt, do you want to add anything?", "Matt Flannery", "Bill, touched upon on it right, a lot of the operational efficiencies, you need to time to actually achieve right, so specifically as we report achieved synergies, you\u2019ll see more achieved synergies from branch operations coming in 2013 than you did 2012, and we\u2019ll get to our 200 million achieved for the full year and that bring us to a run rate of 220 by year end 2013. So most of the achievement will be done by year end 2013, to get to our 230 and 250 fully developed plan.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "Got it. The last thing I was hoping to ask is and I apologize if I missed it earlier. How should we thinking about the cadence of CapEx for 2013? Is it falls in normal splits of 60:40or?", "Bill Plummer", "It\u2019s \u2013 Ted, it\u2019s Bill, again. We\u2019ve thought very carefully about it this year and so I think what you will see is that the cadence by quarters in 2013, will look a little bit more like what you\u2019ve seen in prior years like 2011 for example then what you saw in 2012.", "We\u2019re very heavily frontend loaded things in 2012 roughly I think I have got the numbers here in front of me. In the first quarter we spent about 36% of our total year spend last year in the first quarter and then another 35% in the second quarter and then it went 18% and 11%.", "For 2013, I think you can look for us to be more like what we were in 2011, which was 19% in the first quarter of 2011. We\u2019re probably going to be around that \u2013 around that level again this year. And then the second quarter may not be dramatically different than it was in the prior year, so probably 35%, 36%, 37% in that area. We\u2019re probably loaded a little bit more of a spend in the third quarter than we normally might. So, call it 30% or so, and then remainder in the fourth quarter of this year. That\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s important you understand the pacing, so that you get a good sense of how that capital spend will play out across the year. That helped?", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna", "That\u2019s super helpful. Best of luck this quarter, guys.", "Bill Plummer", "Thank you.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thanks, Ted.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "Mike Kneeland", "Hi, George.", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thanks and good morning.", "Mike Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Bill Plummer", "Good morning, Joe.", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Could you outline some of the specific steps that you\u2019re taking to ensure rental revenue growth in 2013 will outpace the overall rental market?", "Mike Kneeland", "Specific steps, I think, if you take a look at our investor presentation, Juan, who is our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, laid out a very detailed map of how we\u2019re looking at the world and how we\u2019re planned to attack it. Using total control, going after verticals, specifically and also implementing the sales force automation tools that we have out there, and \u2013 I mean, those are lot of dynamics that we\u2019ve laid out. It\u2019s a lot of the best practices that we\u2019ve learned between both companies of how we\u2019re going after the market. And core is another one that we\u2019ve rolled out and we got to educate the legacy employees and that\u2019s been fully laid out, and they\u2019ve been educated on that. And 2012 was as much as really kind of integrate and learn. So that in 2013 that we could be prepared. And those are probably the biggest things that I can think off. Matt, if you want to add anything?", "Matt Flannery", "Yeah, I mean if you\u2019re just talking about \u2013 talking about overall from 10,000 feet. We spent more time and energy in the past six months on preparing our sales team for sales force effectiveness through new tools in training then we have \u2013 in my 20 years in the industry and this I really think we\u2019ll see the benefit of that. On top of the stabilization of everybody being there, new territories, there are new stores and just the overall, the full year effect of having the team together I think we will be able to achieve the growth that we have forecasted.", "Mike Kneeland", "I would also point out that there is going to be some things that we are going to roll out this year, that we just haven\u2019t announced. We are going expand on some of the technology and leverage that, some of the best practices that we haven\u2019t yet implemented, will be rolled out, and you know so to be more to come.", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Next question is related to margins, the midpoint of your 2013, guidance suggest EBITDA margins of 46% will that be the new steady state or do you see additional upside to 46% beyond 2013.", "Mike Kneeland", "Well, I will be missed and tell you I think there is upside, right. Because the idea is that you know we continue to drive profitable growth. We have a lot of things that we are going to be utilizing some of what, we just mentioned some of the things around profitability by product and by customer, that technology exists rolling that out, implementing those type of tools, further capital efficiencies around, what\u2019s not available for rent all to margin improvement. So, for me I would tell you that there is just more to come.", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Very helpful. And then last question, could you give us some color on how much revenue synergies you expect to achieve in 2013?", "Matt Flannery", "Hi, this is Matt. We haven\u2019t pegged specific number on it. I will say that we are well on target to hitting our commitment of $50 million of incremental EBITDA that we reported last year is our target. And if you recall that will come at a high flow through, because where we are getting that will be somewhere between 460 million and $70 million of additional revenue.", "And I\u2019m not even trying to avoid giving you an answer. The real challenge is unlike cost synergies, we have set things in motion to achieve revenue synergies, but we actually have to build the revenue, which is going to come throughout the year to take credit for. But we do feel that we\u2019ve the actions in place to meet and probably exceed our plan.", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah, on that point, just to point out, the harmonization of all the contracts, although we kind of, almost all being done, they are not all done. We\u2019ve got about 90% done. We\u2019ll get the balance of those baked into this quarter. I think Matt\u2019s exactly right as you see the quarters unfold this year, you\u2019ll see more visibility around those numbers.", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Right. Thanks and congratulations on the quarter.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Bill Plummer", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein from Citigroup. Your question please.", "Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup", "All right. Thank you. Good morning and congrats again on a good year and in terms of the acquisition as well, in terms of your integration. Question back in terms of the EBITDA guidance, Bill and if you kind to walk through some of the key pieces, I\u2019m trying to get a feel for how we should think about the volume impacts.", "And you just mentioned that the incremental costs synergies of that\u2019s give you call it $100 million incremental benefit. The benefit from rate should give you another call it $180 million and obviously these are not given of course. But I\u2019m trying to think about if you assume a more weak equal weighted spent on that billion of net CapEx implies about $500 million in higher pro forma average OEC and you\u2019re saying that utilization is up some on 12. So, what should we kind of an appropriate drop through range that we can think about on that incremental volume", "Bill Plummer", "Tim, so make sure I understand your question. You\u2019re looking for the drop through of just incremental volume alone.", "Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup", "Yeah, exactly.", "Mike Kneeland", "So, what I would say is we haven\u2019t parsed it at that level, we got I mean we gave the guidance that shows you the increment \u2013 the drop through for overall revenue, whether it\u2019s price, volume, mix, whatever \u2013 fleet, whatever is implicit in the guidance. And David Raso earlier talked about 63% if you exclude the impact of synergies. We haven\u2019t broken out the incremental impact of volume at that level of detail. So, I\u2019d \u2013 I actually don\u2019t even have number committed to memory that I\u2019d want throw out there. Clearly volume is going to be a focus for us. We\u2019re putting more fleet in. We\u2019re going to raise utilization and certainly that\u2019s going to be a key driver of our overall profit improvement. But why don\u2019t we leave the discussion at the total revenue level.", "Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. All right, fair enough. And then, Bill, in terms of the mix impact, how should we just kind of bridging that price versus volume and then the additional kind of unknown. What should we think about from a modeling perspective in terms of what that mix factor looks like in 2013 as you\u2019ve moved more of your business toward to these monthly contracts.", "Bill Plummer", "Certainly. So as we look at 2013 and what\u2019s implicit in the guidance is a mix impact that\u2019s somewhere around a 0.5 of headwind. So, 4.5% rate whatever your model for volume is and explicitly we\u2019re saying about a 0.5 of mixed headwind, that will give you the high-single digits creeping upon 10% revenue growth that\u2019s implicit in that overall total revenue growth that we\u2019ve guided to. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.", "Timothy Thein \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I have two quick ones and then one more philosophical. The first where do we stand on the stock repurchase authorization and where do we stand on the RP basket? And then the last one is, with regard to acquisitions clearly the integration of RSC is going well. In 2013, would you consider looking at other targets of upsides?", "Mike Kneeland", "So on the share repurchase, Phil, we\u2019ve got about $85 million left to do, and we will \u2013 we will manage that the way we said initially, which was we\u2019re going to get it done over in 18-month period post \u2013 post the close, and we will just spend it as we go along. In terms of the RP basket, I\u2019m going to look over at Irene, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s sitting here, and say where is that on your cheat sheet, Irene, help me?", "Irene Moshouris", "It\u2019s the acquisition notes, and then the most restricted within the $50 million.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I\u2019m sorry could you say that again.", "Irene Moshouris", "$250 million.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you, Irene. And I guess Michael, maybe the acquisition question?", "Mike Kneeland", "Yeah, with acquisition, we always are going to be focused on driving profitable growth, I would say, and you\u2019re going to hear me say that over and over. Strategically, it has fit, it has to \u2013 there have been a lot of rigor around this, it also has to be accretive, and the cultural fit. And having said all that, we always look at what\u2019s out there and I think one of the areas that was very evident that we\u2019re going to be focusing on is our specialties side of the business, which is a very high return and bodes very well with our current customer mix, as we go forward. So again opportunistic, but no need to rush out there, and we\u2019ll continue as we stated earlier, we\u2019ve got a lot of free cash flow and not only this year, but the years to come. So, but we\u2019re going to be in a position.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "That\u2019s great. And then maybe I can just ask, are the number of books coming across your desk, are opportunities increasing or decreasing in terms of potential M&A that you\u2019re analyzing?", "Mike Kneeland", "I don\u2019t measure it in that way. I think that people try to get into \u2013 and to talk to us to get a sense of what our thoughts are and I will tell you that I turn away as many years I open up, so I don\u2019t measure it in that form, it\u2019s just I think people are trying to understand what our appetite is and we\u2019ve got this \u2013 these integrations underway that\u2019s foremost on my radar screen. It\u2019s delivering what we said we\u2019re going to deliver and then some we got the best in class, we got to deliver on the best practices and then it has to be strategic. How can it fit with our long-term view.", "Philip Volpicelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Michael Kneeland for closing comments.", "Mike Kneeland", "Thanks, operator and thanks, everyone for joining us today. You\u2019ll find our Investor presentation on our website. We\u2019ve got some updated data that we hopefully find \u2013 you find is useful for all of you and as always feel free to call us or Fred Bratman here in Greenwich and you can discuss the details in more \u2013 all of the comments in detail. And also if anyone would like to extend visitation to anyone of our sites to get a better sense of how we operate it.

You should also note that the company's earnings release, investor presentation and today's call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone, and welcome. As the operator said, with me today is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior management team.", "I'll start off with some of the numbers you saw last night, and then I'll talk about our operating environment, including the status of the recovery. And then after that, Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail, and then we'll go over to Q&A.", "Our first quarter results made a strong statement about commitment to profitable growth. In our slowest seasonal quarter, we generated $451 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 41% margin. That's 420 basis points higher than last year, and it's also a first quarter record for us. And we intend to deliver over $2.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA on approximately $5 billion of revenue this year. And we hit our mark with total revenue in the quarter despite a harsh winter in the Northeast and Central U.S.", "Three key metrics met or exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Our rates, time utilization and used equipment margin were all up year-over-year. Now the combination of these metrics tells us that our customers are truly in a recovery, and our CORE business overall is very strong. An important part of our strategy is to submit our relationships with key accounts, and we did exactly that in the quarter, with our key account rental revenue up more than 11% year-over-year.", "Now on the cost side, we continue to make progress with synergies from the merger. And as you saw last night, we realized another $53 million of cost savings in the quarter, and our target of $230 million to $250 million remains realistic as a fully developed run rate.", "Now before I continue, I should remind everyone that our year-over-year comparisons are still on a pro forma basis. That is we're measuring the quarter against the combined results of RSC and United Rentals in the first quarter of 2012. And we closed the RSC transaction at the end April last year, so we have one more quarter of pro forma comparisons to go.", "So let's turn to the external environment. I'm pleased to say that we feel just as bullish about the recovery as we did in our last call. The national indicators for construction and industrial are still positive. And more important, they're trending upward. In fact, I was in Dallas a few weeks ago to meet with our regional leaders, and it was brought up several times about the environment. Their confidence level is high, and there's far less uncertainty than a year ago.", "In early 2012, we were still debating whether the recovery was real. Now it's more a question of pace. And there's also a layer of secular penetration that I've spoken about in the past. Much of the penetration is coming from customers who are very savvy about fleet and are now renting some of the fleet they used to own, so they know about the equipment applications. Now these customers are very focused on reducing costs and improving and increasing their productivity, and our value proposition provides that.", "Currently, we have $7.2 billion of rental fleet based on original equipment cost, and that includes $166 million of net rental CapEx we spent through March. Last year, if you recall, we front-loaded our fleet and spent about 36% of our annual CapEx in the first quarter. We did that to take advantage of an attractive Tier 3 pricing that was available to us. Now this year, we spent about 19% of our CapEx in the first quarter, which reflects a return to more normalized levels. And we plan to spend over $600 million on fleet in the second quarter, which will put us about 50% of CapEx deployed by the end of June. And we could spend more in the quarter if we feel that it's warranted. But in any case, we expect our full year gross investment in fleet to be close to our outlook, which is about $1.5 billion.", "Now as we add fleet, we're also taking the necessary steps to get that fleet into the hands of our customers, and I'm talking about sales presence. Now last year, when we merged the 2 companies, we went to a complete review of our sales training, compensation, territory structure and sales management. And it's a big part of our integration. And we got everybody on the same page. Now we have a cohesive sales environment, and we're going to add more feet on the street as part of our plan. We currently have about 1,200 outside sales reps in the field, and we expect to increase that number by at least 10% over the next 12 months.", "Our salespeople are the frontline of our strategy. Their primary job is to develop relationships with our customers. Which is the bedrock of our growth, and has our full attention. They're also an important part of our plan to reduce volatility in our business mix.", "This year, we see an additional opportunity to revitalize a group, what we call unassigned accounts. Unassigned accounts are typically local commercial contractors, and they currently represent about 38% of our base. Our revenue on the unassigned accounts grew in the first quarter year-over-year, but it could have been more robust. Now there are still some lingering effects of the integration and the branch consolidation, but our reps are increasing their touches with unassigned accounts to tap more strongly into this space.", "So as you can see, there's a lot going on, and our branch teams are energized by the activities that surrounds them. Our employees know that we're selling the best value proposition in the industry, leading with safety first. We've given them the tools and technology to hone in on market opportunities and capture share.", "Every one of our regions is driving hard to be a top performer this year. Now to give you a snapshot of our regions in the first quarter, 10 of our 14 regions had year-over-year growth in rental revenue, and the headwinds from the remaining 4 regions were mostly related to weather. And if you recall, we almost had no winter last year, so some of the projects got off to a slower start this year. But it doesn't qualify as a market trend. Western Canada, on the other hand, was booming, up more than 19% due to the energy sector. And our specialty rentals segment generated increase of more than 28% year-over-year. Now within specialty, power HVAC was up more than 41%, including same-store increase of 31%. And we plan to continue to expand our specialty footprint this year and cross-sell these services even more vigorously with our customers.", "Matt will be here on the call, and he'll be available during Q&A to answer any questions you may have about our field operations and the integration.", "So in summary, there are many positive undercurrents for our company, both internally and externally. And we're going to grow our business at every level, from our top line to our shareholder value. And that growth is going to be robust. In fact, we think it will outpace the market, which is a forecast to increase about 6% this year, with close to 10% growth in 2014.", "Now I want to emphasize that we're being very targeted about opportunities in this environment. We know that some transactions will be more profitable than others as we enter -- as our end markets begin to recover, and we will not be chasing every deal. We're not interested in escalating our revenues if it hurts our margins in the process. We want to serve our customers, and we want to do it in a way that drives exceptional returns. And then we want to retain those profitable customers and expand our base. That's what our strategy is designed to do. And clearly, we're succeeding.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you, Bill.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll provide a little bit more detail on the quarter. But maybe I'll do it a little differently this quarter than in many quarters past. We've gotten some very specific questions in reaction to our release last night, and I thought I'd take the time to walk through a couple of items that I think will help people understand the quarter better and help flesh out the discussions. Along the way, I'll try to throw in some of the key performance measures for the quarter. But if I miss anything, please do raise it in Q&A.", "And I think it'd be useful to structure the discussion around a bridge of EBITDA from last year to this year. Last year, we delivered $392 million of pro forma adjusted EBITDA, and that goes to the $451 million that we delivered in the first quarter of this year. And again, everything in this discussion, except where I might note it, will be a pro forma discussion.", "So how did we go from $392 million to $451 million? We told you about our synergy results in the quarter. We realized $53 million of synergies in the quarter, so that has a direct add-on to last year's adjusted EBITDA. If you dive a little deeper into our revenue performance in the quarter, we told you that we delivered 5.4% rental rate increases year-over-year. That 5.4%, if you apply it to the prior year's owned equipment rental revenue and you have the use OER rather than the total rental revenue in order to get the right measure, right, the rental rate only applies to the owned equipment revenue. It doesn't apply to re-rent. It doesn't apply to the ancillary items within rental revenue. And that's one of the reasons why we call those pieces out in our press release this year because it's a significant item in the quarter.", "So if you applied 5.4% rental rate to last year's OER, which was about 86% of last year's total rental revenue, you get about $40 million of rate impact on a year-over-year basis. And since that's rate, it's almost 100% flow-through. So call it $40 million of increased EBITDA from rental rate alone.", "On volume, we called volume OEC-on-Rent growth year-over-year at 5.8% in the quarter. That's what we realized this year. So if you used that 5.8% and apply it to the prior year OER, you get a volume impact at revenue, which you then need to reduce the EBITDA by using a flow-through. We used about 70% flow-through on the volume impact. And if you use 5.8% volume, 70% flow-through, you get an EBITDA impact from volume of about $30 million. So that's an add-on to last year. We also had a better used equipment sale gross profit result this year of about $5 million better than last year, so that's an add-on. So those are all the add-ons that take you from last year to this year, and that increases last year's EBITDA by $128 million.", "So let me walk now through the deductions that get you down to the $451 million that we reported this year. Within the quarter this year compared to last year, we had one less working day in 2012 -- excuse me, in the 2013 quarter. And one of the working days that we had in 2013 was Good Friday. Good Friday and Easter fell into the second quarter last year. They were in the first quarter this year. So when you look at that impact, our revenue per working day is in the area of $10 million per working day, and the flow-through on those working days is pretty high. So the net effect of having one less working day, plus one of the working days being a semi-holiday, was about $12 million at EBITDA in the year-over-year comparison. So there's a $12 million deduct.", "The other lines of business, including our contractor supplies business and our service and other line, was down year-over-year in the quarter. That reflected the strategy we've been focusing more on rental and, therefore, allowing the revenue items to find their own level while increasing the margins in those lines of business. But it also reflected the fact that we sold wind [ph] systems during the course of last year, and the year-over-year impact there was a decline in the gross profit.", "So when you look at those other lines of business, and I lump in along with those other lines of business, the year-over-year change in non-rental equipment sales, the sales of delivery trucks, trailers, things like that, those all add up to a deduct of somewhere in the $10 million to -- roughly, $10 million area, let's call it.", "Period mix. You've heard us talk about this a lot. Our mix on a day, week and month basis has been shifting toward monthly. That's been pretty consistent over the last several years. In the first quarter, our period mix shifted to 77.1% monthly. That's 170 basis points greater monthly share this year compared to last year. We have a methodology internally that we use to estimate that period mix impact, and that gives us about a $10 million EBITDA impact year-over-year in the first quarter. So there's a $10 million deduct there.", "And then I mentioned previously ancillary revenues and re-rent revenues. Those are part of our rental revenue, our total rental revenues. They were down year-over-year. Both were, we believe, responding to our strategy with re-rents, in particular. Since the merger, we've been very focused on displacing re-rented items with items that are in our own portfolio, and you saw the impact there. Our re-rent in the quarter was down about $22.6 million -- excuse me, 22.6% compared to last year, the dollar amounts appreciably smaller. But that represents a drag as does the ancillary items, items like pickup and delivery charges, our loss damage waiver program and so on. Those were down a combined 2.3% in the quarter. So when you look at the EBITDA impact of those revenue declines, we get about a $5 million deduct for ancillary and re-rent. So those are sort of the normal routine things that represent a deduct in the year-over-year EBITDA.", "In addition, there were several items that we would categorize as one-timers in the quarter. So for example, we were implementing a focus on reducing our OEC not available across the business in the first quarter. We had some success there. We were able to reduce that OEC not available to the lowest level that we've seen in a couple of years at one point during the quarter. We will continue that focus. But as you do it, it incurs incremental expense in labor, parts purchases and other supplies associated with getting the equipment up and ready for the busy season. That incremental effort cost us, we estimate, about $5 million in the quarter. Again, it's a one-timer. It'll certainly be -- there'll certainly be some over effect of that effort in the second quarter, but it will be reduced versus what we experienced in the first quarter.", "During the quarter, we also were very heavily investing in implementing a lean management technique called 5S, many of you have heard us talk about it, across our branches. That effort requires us to rearrange our maintenance shops and do things like repainting the floors, repainting lines, adding new signage, adding new tools and racking and so on. We estimate that, that effort in the first quarter cost us an incremental $5 million as well in overall costs.", "And then finally, we had what is a more normal effect but one that we felt we should call out, the impact of our merit increases on a year-over-year basis, which was again about $5 million. 5s are wild here today. But those 3 impacts we wanted to call out because they represent significant incremental costs in the first quarter. If you deduct those 5 by 3, you get another $15 reduction -- $15 million reduction, and that leaves about $15 million of the year-over-year EBITDA change unexplained. We attribute that remaining $15 million or so to weather and other unexplainable items.", "On the weather front, you've heard us talk about it. We had a real winter this year, and that compares to last year, where winter was very mild across most of the continent. That weather impact hits us both in the top line, reduces your productivity and your ability to get the fleet ready and out on rent, reduces the demand from projects that are slow. But it also hits you on the cost lines as it costs you more to just prepare your equipment for delivery. And so we estimate that impact, along with -- and there are host of other puts and takes that are all aggregate as being somewhere around $15 million or so.", "So that gets you from last year's EBITDA to the $451 million that we reported this year. Hopefully, that's helpful and addresses questions that we've had. But if not, then please do ask further questions during Q&A.", "One other discussion that we have with folks following the report last night revolved around our flow-through in the quarter. Flow-through in total for the quarter was $164 million -- excuse me, 164% when you include the impact of the synergies. But when you exclude the synergies, it drops appreciably. And the question was your flow-through x synergies in prior quarters have been much higher. You told us that you're going to get to the 60% to 70% range flow-through x synergies for the full year. What's going on? How are you going to get there? Well, I called out of those specific items in the quarter, the 3 $5 million hits for a 5S, OEC not available and our merit increases. Those were direct drags to our flow-through when you exclude the impact of the synergies this year. So when you add that $15 million -- you add back that $15 million drag to the year-over-year revenue change x synergies, you get a flow-through that's right at 58%. And for the first quarter, 58% x synergies is in the zone where we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to deliver the flow-through x synergies for the full year in that normal range of 60% to 70%. So hopefully, that addresses that question that some of you may have had about our flow-through performance in the quarter.", "Before I wrap-up, I just want to spend a couple of minutes updating our outlook. It'll be very quick because we haven't changed any component of our outlook. We still expect the full year rental rate increase to come in at 4.5%, and we still are very focused on delivering the time utilization and revenue and EBITDA guidance that we gave earlier in the year. So revenue will be between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, and time utilization within rental revenue will be about 68% for the full year. That's up 50 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year will be between $2.250 billion and $2.350 billion. And we continue to expect, as Mike said, to spend $1.5 billion gross rental CapEx, which will net down to about $1,050,000,000 after the impact of used sales proceeds.", "Finally, free cash flow will continue to be robust. We had a good free cash result in the first quarter, $234 million, and it puts us well on the path to deliver the $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow that we expect for the full year this year. And I might emphasize it continues us on the path to deliver the kind of free cash flow over the next several years that we've talked about, most specifically back in our Investor Day in December. Over the next few years, we expect to deliver almost $2 billion of free cash flow, and we feel that, that will be a very, very robust cash flow environment for the company even while we're continuing to grow the fleet, continuing to grow top line and continuing to deliver the kind of profitability and margin and return that we're targeting to deliver.", "So with that, I'll end my comments and ask the operator to open the call up for questions and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "How should we think about the mix and the ancillary revenue headwinds going forward? Should that start to abate? Or is that going to continue to be negative $10 million, $15 million a quarter going forward?", "William B. Plummer", "Seth, I guess, maybe what I can usefully say is a comment about the full year rather than the quarter-by-quarter. I think you remember we said back in January, that we expected the full year mix impact to be something like 1.5% on the full year. I think it's fair to say now that the mix will be a little bit more than that, more of a headwind than that during the course of the year. It'll be less than it was last year. I think it was 5.1% last year so somewhere between 5.1% and 1.5% is where we'll end up over the course of the year. And I'll leave it to your own imagination as to how you parse that out across the quarters. But that's the overall mix, by the way. That's including all of the effects. The $10 million that I gave here was just the day, week and month component of mix. And you got to make sure that you make that distinction. But overall, we think it'll be something a little bit more negative than 1.5% but less negative than 5.1%.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then with the pull forward of the CapEx in the second quarter, the $600 million, how should we think about -- I assume free cash flow would be negative in the quarter. What -- can you frame the order of magnitude we should be thinking about for free cash flow use in the second quarter?", "William B. Plummer", "I'd rather not. We get that granular on the timing of free cash flow through the quarter. The $600 million, if we deliver that and if you assume that we have a payables, payable terms with our vendors, that they're somewhere in the 60-day area, that can give you a rough idea of the impact that we will see in the second quarter. So I'll stop there, Seth.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Could I ask -- slide another one in then? It sounds like you're suggesting that there could be some specialty -- you're talking about expanding your specialty footprint. I mean, is that going to be organic or do you think that'll be acquisition? And is that -- does your guidance include some acquisitions for this year in the specialty rental business?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "This is Mike. And that is -- it's organic. What we've got in there is baked into our plan. We are going to be opening up some locations in all 3 segments: Trench, Power, HVAC; and also in our tools, which is all organic. We haven't baked in any assumptions for acquisitions at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "With regard to the additional sales force, could you take us a level deeper there? You mentioned unassigned accounts. Is it -- is that predominantly where it's going to be? Is there going to be some in national strategic as well and just kind of the productivity curve you expect from these salespeople being added?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "So this is Matt, Scott. Primarily, this will be local reps. We feel very comfortable with the output from our strategic account managers and that part of our sales team. We just want to -- and this has been built into our plan. We just want to pivot from the integration period where we were stabilizing and really focused on harmonizing contracts and all the things that went with our sales efforts last year and pivot to growth mode. There's a portion of these sales reps that's more R&D. But as we continue to grow in 2014 and beyond, we think it's appropriate to add to our sales force to help facilitate that growth.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then one more, if I could. On the 10 of the 14 regions that were positive, could you -- I guess, specifically on the 4 that were not in the quarter, were those Northern regions? Could you kind of address where the weakness was and what you expect from those regions and overall progression over the year?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Yes, I don't want to point to a specific region. But I will say, we all know where the weather-related markets are in the Northeastern half of the continent, in the Midwest as well. So that's where our issues were. To be clear, none of the -- some of them were only down by less than half a point. But nonetheless, for transparency, they were negative. We don't expect any of those regions to not show positive year-over-year growth by the end of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So Bill, I understand why you're adding back the 3 $5 million headwinds to kind of get you to that 58% flow-through x synergy. But why wouldn't you add back the $12 million EBITDA headwind from workdays since that should theoretically reverse in 2Q?", "William B. Plummer", "The workday impact is in revenue as well, and so we just think it's a more fair representation the way that I described it.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But we should see that somewhat reverse then in 2Q though, right?", "William B. Plummer", "You should. 2Q workdays are flat year-over-year, so I don't expect that there'll be much of an impact from working days certainly in the second quarter.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, perfect.", "William B. Plummer", "We don't recall what the full year comparison of workdays is. You can count your calendar as well as I can.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just to follow-up on Seth's specialty question, can you guys give us a sense of what the breakout would be by volume of equipment on rent versus pricing so we can essentially see the difference between specialty and the general rents business?", "William B. Plummer", "So -- go ahead, Mike.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Go ahead, Bill.", "William B. Plummer", "No, I was just going to ask for clarification. You're asking for a breakout by specialty versus gen rent of volume rate?", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Correct. Yes, exactly.", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, that's not something that we've done historically, Joe, so let's not break new precedents right now. We'll give some thought about whether we should say more about that as the specialty business grows in scale.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "That's fair. Maybe let me ask it this way then. Can you give us a sense of how much of the growth that you're seeing within specialty as a function of you pulling out the re-rent from RSC?", "William B. Plummer", "It's a nontrivial contributor to growth. But we are also very, very keenly focused on growing just in and of itself. So we've had close starts that we've opened that really weren't driven by displacing re-rents. We have had investment in the fleet that's above and beyond what was needed to displace re-rents in a very significant way. So I don't know what the percentage mix would be, but I would say most of the growth is coming from our focus on driving the business more so than displacing re-rents.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, Joe, this is Mike. I would say that's exactly right. I mean, we went to the harmonization of contracts. And keep in mind, with RSC, it wasn't something they promoted because they didn't have it. We do. We're cross-selling it, and we are pursuing it across a broader footprint. For an example, like the tools that they -- that RSC had, we're now replicating that across our broad footprint, and we've seen significant growth. And we're going to continue to support that growth as we go forward. So to me, it was the best of both worlds and where we can capture a lot of the synergies down the road. And again, it's profitable and it's part of our strategy to help untangle our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So the first thing I was hoping to circle back on was the commentary around the key accounts and the unsigned accounts, and you've consistently laid out on in the slide deck kind of what those numbers look like on a relative basis. The unassigned accounts certainly have been growing at a substantially slower than the key accounts. And I think we all understand that the focus has been on more profitable business, higher skew towards industrial. But I think we've also seen kind of across the competitive landscape relative growth rates among all the competitors. Do you think part of the reason -- do you think that the unsigned accounts are on an underlying basis growing at a faster rate than the key accounts?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I would say that is growing. Certainly, it's growing on a year-over-year basis. As you know that the residential market is starting to heal. That's going to add to the to that mix and something we don't participate in. But inside of that, what we're trying to articulate is that the localized customers takes a lot more touches. And we -- and it's feeder based. There are very attractive customers inside of that group that we'd like to hold on to. And as we went through the integration, we wanted to make sure that we stabilized and captured our most profitable customers and get everyone on the same page. And as Matt stated earlier, we're now pivoting and going after what we believe inside of that group is profitable. And typically, small-end projects are going to ramp up quicker, and you're going to see higher results sooner. It takes a while to plan for a convention center or a sports stadium or a hotel or a power plant. It doesn't happen overnight. Whereas if you want to do spot remodeling or do some landscaping, that's real time and doesn't take a lot of effort to get that up and running. So some of it may be phased in over time. But we think our end market, given what we're seeing in the ABI Index, is going to provide very nice growth in the future.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. The second thing I just wanted to get a little more clarity on, on the synergy side of things, could you walk through what portion would be attributable to cost of rent, what might be other aspects of COGS that are non-rental related and what was SG&A?", "William B. Plummer", "Sure thing, Ted. If you take the $53 million, $24 million of that was cost of rent saves and the remainder $29 million was SG&A saves.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "It was. And so I guess what I'm trying to square up is, if I were to say the underlying SG&A rate was, I think, 160 reported, plus 29. You get to 189. Can you just bridge this year-on-year, where those incremental costs came from on a pro forma basis?", "William B. Plummer", "So, Ted, I don't have the detail and you don't have the patience for me to go through every department line. But we do break down our synergies by functional department at corporate and by the SG&A roles in the field. And it's really too much detail to go through. And quite honestly, I don't know that it adds a lot of value for discussion. If there are specific areas that you're interested in, I guess we can talk about them broadly. But we don't have a sort of a useful digestible summary to talk about right here and now.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. I can take it offline.", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, that's probably best.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.", "Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Manish Somaiya from Citi. A couple of questions. One is on market share. We have had a couple of regional issuers come to the high-yield market, and they've all kind of said that they've gained customers from your transition. And I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts, was this clever pruning on your part or is there something more?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, I think that there was some pruning on our part. Clearly, as we went through and consolidated our locations, there was a component of walk-in business that we knew we weren't going to retain. So that's something that we willing to sacrifice as we went forward. As you know, part of our strategy is that longer-term customer to benefit from our broad footprint and more of the regional and national account. 11.5% growth in the key account, I would tell you we think that we're outperforming the market. So could they in certain markets? Yes, absolutely. At the results of our closures, that could be had. There again, on rental rates, we want to make sure that we're getting the right return for our business. And that's an area that -- everyone's raising their rates. But we believe our rates, according to the Rouse data, is primarily one of the highest, if not the highest, according to their market survey. So in those areas, yes, you're going to expect some leakage.", "Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "All right. And then just clearly, I mean, the transaction with RSC was a game changer. We're seeing all the synergies flow-through. But can you just help us understand the synergies that someone like a URI would have acquiring a small regional player?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Again, I go back to my fundamentals of why you would do an acquisition. One would be, strategically, does it make sense? So strategically, is it in a market we don't serve? Is it a product we don't serve? Do they have a heavier component and, say, earthmoving than we don't have today? Is it something more industrial? Is it more related to the power HVAC tools or the trench business, so that we can broaden our footprint quicker and get a higher return? That would be one. So strategically, that -- it has to fit that bucket. The other bucket would be is, economically, does it make sense? Is there enough synergies? Can we buy it in a point where it makes sense to our shareholders? And then the last one is going to be culture. There are companies that answer the first 2 but the cultures are so different. It's very hard to blend cultures that are miles apart, and it's fraught with risk. So we tend to look at all 3 of those as we think about acquisitions.", "Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just finally, clearly, there's some long runway on the domestic front for you. How do you think about potentially analyzing entering certain international markets?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I always get that question, and I answer it by saying that North America's still the largest market. We're still in the teens when it comes to market share. We still have ways to go to fully integrate the acquisition. And as I mentioned, there are segments like the power HVAC tools and trench that we can integrate with our current customer portfolio. That being said, we do have customers who have been knocking on our door, asking us to go because of our value proposition. When we think that we've exhausted our opportunities here and our customers, the valuation to our customers is so great. I think that we'll have to look at it. But right here and now, North America's still the largest opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.", "Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Have you seen any disparity in rental revenue performance between industrial and construction end markets in the quarter?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, Matt can talk specifically. But typically, the industrial is a -- has -- there's 2 ways of looking at it. There's shutdowns, which are planned, and then there's new construction. We do know there's a lot of new construction that is planned. We're seeing an insurgence of chemical companies. We're seeing automotive expansion not only in the big 3, but also in foreign investment. We're seeing expansion in other areas. It takes time to get them up and running. It's good -- we're happy to say that the book of business that we see is relatively strong in that segment, but there is a phase-in effect. The way I look at it is you see residential grow. You're going to see smaller construction grow. And then you start seeing commercial, which requires engineering and drawings and a process for bidding, grow. And then you see the industrial grow as well.", "Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, question on the cost side. I guess, one more focus on reducing OEC not available this year than in the past. And then, I guess, the second part of that, what kind of benefits do you expect to see from the greater focus?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, I will tell you that one of the things that we learn in the best-in-class with RSC was they were very good at not available for rent. They did a system called Spin. We have workbench. We're a combination of 2. We're rolling that out. What does it benefit or how does it benefit us with $7.2 billion of fleet? If we can take that down and get 2 points of fleet that's available for rent and put it out on rent, that's a sizable amount of cash. And so it helps our returns. And so again, it's part of that best-in-class practice that we learned. We're implementing it, and we're rolling it out throughout the organization.", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Yes, I agree with Mike. It also gives us an opportunity to maybe push limits of our peak time utilization during peak periods. Because if we're able to turn fleet quicker, we can say yes to more customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the earlier question on mix. Could you give us additional details on what specific items will help reduce the negative mix impact on rental revenues in 2013 versus 2012?", "William B. Plummer", "So we touched a little bit on re-rent and ancillary, and the year-over-year comparisons in re-rent and ancillary could be a little bit of a help as we go through the year. Re-rent, right, once we close the deal in the early part of the second quarter last year is when we started that effort to displace re-rents. And so that effect was starting to play out in the second, third, fourth quarter last year. And so when compared to that, this year, it may not be as much of a drag as it was in the first quarter. I think as we come into the seasonally more active time of the year, the impact of some of the day, week and month mix or the shift to monthly on a year-over-year basis might go down as you have a little bit more of the seasonal work that starts to pop up. So that could be a positive. What else? Anything else, Matt, that you can think of that we can throw out there?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "No, I think you covered it.", "William B. Plummer", "Yes. So I mean, I think it's items like that we look at and we say, \"Okay, a lot of headwind in the first quarter.\" But as we see the quarters play out, that will reduce as we go through the year.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And as you're adding to the sales force, how should we think about the impact to margin growth?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "So as far as from a cost prospective, that employee base is 80%, plus variable, so -- and we have it built into our plan. I think we had 130 additional reps built into our plan, and we may peak out at 150. So that variance of 20 reps is not going to be material. And as far as revenue, we're really expecting to hope to see that in the back half the year and more importantly, in 2014 and beyond. Part of adding these new reps is an R&D project. We went to home-grow a lot of these reps. And we think that by bringing in new talent not just to the company, but to the industry, we could really get some long-term positive effects from that.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And then lastly, could tell us what your progress is in achieving revenue synergies this year and where the opportunity is coming from?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "So George, we haven't published a number. But as we think about the revenue synergies drivers, we've made some good progress in areas like displacing re-rents. That's been an important revenue synergy driver, and we do track it. We've made some important progress in the harmonization of contracts between the legacy RSC contracts and the legacy United Rentals, where that work is essentially done. A few lingering contracts are out there yet to be finalized but essentially done. And we can track the changes in rate and other terms from the old contracts to the new and identify revenue synergies from those changes. And there are several others that we track. The challenge we have in putting a number out there is that the revenue dis-synergies that occur are hard to quantify. Really hard to say what did I lose as a result of the integration of our 2 companies. So one concrete example is we closed a lot of branches as part of the consolidation work. Exactly how much walk-in business did I lose that hasn't come back yet? That's very hard to put a number on. And so we're spending a lot of time thinking about how we should think about that dis-synergy offset to the revenue synergies that are reasonably straightforward to calculate before we start talking about a concrete number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.", "Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wondering, just broadly, I mean, do you think there's a lot of pent-up demand in the second quarter based on the weather impact from the first quarter?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "I think that the demand that we're seeing early here in the second quarter, I would characterize as strong. I would feel that we've had a great first 2 weeks to the quarter, right on plan. But this is the normal seasonal build that we expect in the strong environment, and I do feel we're in that strong environment. I wouldn't really call it pent-up. I think the major projects that would create that demand, as Mike had stated earlier, really need a lot more planning than to get too far thrown off tilt by 2 or 3 weeks of bad weather. We -- I hope to see that maybe in that unassigned, and that's why we want to make sure we're touching those customers, more of the small projects that we didn't see kick off in Q1. It'd be nice to see that pick up and that would be a surprise. But other than that, I wouldn't see a pent-up demand effect.", "Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just on rental, clearly, it's been a bright spot in the broader machinery industry overall. I mean, imagine there've got to be other folks that are clawing to squeeze a little bit more into rental business. Now are you seeing any signs of increased competition? And what are your expectations on the size of the fleet and just overall fleet growth in any of your key categories in 2013?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "So as we depicted about our $1.5 billion gross capital spend and what does that add, almost $500 million to our fleet, we feel that, that's a consistent growth pattern for us over the next couple of years. We're not seeing anybody work above that pattern that concerns us, specifically in the local markets. We're seeing some fleet replacement, which is great to see. A lot of people have been conserving capital over the last couple of years. But we're not seeing any ultra-aggressive growth in any of our individual markets that shows new players coming in.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, the only thing I would say is where we're spending capital, as you can imagine, is in the power HVAC and in the tools section and also trench as we continue to feed the growth that we're seeing in those markets. But beyond that, I think it's going to be pretty much the same of what you've seen in the past.", "Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on power and HVAC. Can you just talk a little bit more about specifically what have been the drivers more recently in the growth you're seeing? And where is rental penetration now for things like small generators relative your overall business?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, the power HVAC is different than the small generators. It's really a larger-sized generator. It's more of a system than just a generator. So what's driving it for us is we said the harmonization that we have with the contracts that opens the doors where typically the requirements were met by third party. But also, we can now pursue that, and we can pursue it with confidence that we can get more of that business. And in fact, we are. So we're continuing to do that greenfield starts by expanding our portfolio so that we can serve those customers is another avenue. On the tools side, it's really -- it's a whole new system of rolling it out. United Rentals is very good in larger construction projects, whereas RSC was very good in the industrial side. So taking that tool opportunity and deploying that into some of our larger customers. And it's a benefit for them. We're solving it. It's a solution to a problem. It's efficient. We're in, we're out, and we can track everything. So those -- the growth on that is really opening the eyes and cross-selling across our portfolio of customers and our geographic footprint.", "Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just lastly, on the balance sheet, I mean, it seems pretty clear you're focused on generating a lot of cash this year and deleveraging the balance sheet. Is there a number in terms of a debt to EBITDA where you would realistically have to get to before you would consider another medium to sizable acquisition?", "William B. Plummer", "Ross, we don't think about it as a target that we would hit before we do an acquisition. I think Mike articulated how we think about the acquisitions earlier. If we line up those 3 criteria, strategy, economic attractiveness and sort of culture integration risk, and we can rationalize that we're not putting ourselves in a significantly disadvantageous leverage position, we won't shy away from doing acquisitions that make sense. That said, the hurdle is pretty high. And we think we've been pretty disciplined about when we do, do acquisitions in the past, and we'll continue to be disciplined going forward. So I don't know that there is a litmus test of leverage that would say, yes or no, we'll do an acquisition. It just depends on what the opportunity is that's in front of us. That said, we do have an overall strategy on the balance sheet in terms of leverage of being between 2.5x and 3.5x debt to EBITDA. We'll be at 3x by the end of this year, and that gives us plenty of room to do acquisitions and still be true to that approach to the balance sheet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Michael, can you talk about whether you're seeing greater pricing momentum in your monthly book of business or on the shorter term side? Obviously, the shorter term business led the rental rate recovery, and I'm wondering if you're now seeing the monthly momentum accelerating faster than the shorter term rates.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "As far as -- it's harder to quantify that, number one. Number two, I would just say that the monthly rates take time because we have contracts that are outstanding. And as they come off rent, you can re-class them and come out with a higher rate. It's safe to say that our monthly rates continue to improve as we would expect. And as Bill mentioned, to the harmonization was also an uplift that we've seen. We continue -- the day and week, the day is more spot and weekly is less so between the 2. We have the system in place that monitors it, and it enables us to manage it very efficiently. And so I don't know if there's -- if I perfectly answered your question. But the monthly continues to improve.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just to flesh out the cost synergy discussion a bit more, Bill, if you don't mind. Did the pace of SG&A savings really accelerate this quarter? I guess, I was under the impression that early on, you got the cost of rent savings really quickly. And I'm wondering, did the SG&A accelerate this quarter because that $29 million is pretty significant here?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, I'd say most of the SG&A saves happened early on. Right? Most of them came in the form of headcount actions and other actions that you can just do and be done with, and so I would say they did not accelerate. The one SG&A item that maybe got a little better this quarter is the impact on our bad debt expense. But the other SG&A items, I don't think you could say accelerated in any significant way during the quarter. It's the operating, the expense saves, the cost of rent saves that will build -- will continue to build to take us up to the fully developed impact that we talked about, $230 million to $250 million annualized. So that's the way I'd think about it. But in terms of the first quarter, SG&A, they built but it wasn't a major ramp-up, if I remember the numbers correctly.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And lastly, Bill, on Slide 11, when you talked about SG&A, is that a combination of the corporate overhead and other efficiency bucket? Can you just define that for us?", "William B. Plummer", "It's the corporate overhead, it's the field overhead, those areas combine. The other efficiencies are primarily operating and procurement saves. So in that breakdown that we gave you, the SG&A stuff is those 2 overhead slices.", "Operator", "Thank you. Due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Please be sure to go on to our website and download the latest presentation.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. As the operator said, Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer, is here with me; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officer; and other members of our senior management team.", "Well, last night, we reported results that reflect a disciplined company focused on value creation, and it was a strong quarter. And it set the stage for what we expect to be a robust back half of the year. Now, the past 3 months have provided some good insights into the pace of recovery and I want to share some thoughts on that, and then we'll discuss some of the actions that we're taking to grow the business in the current environment. After that, Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail, and then we'll go into Q&A.", "So let's start with our strategy in the second quarter. We increased our revenue, we improved our margins and we brought down our leverage. This has been our strategy all along as a way to achieve long-term profitable growth, and we've shown that we can execute this strategy in any economic climate. Right now, the construction markets are still very soft compared to the pre-recession levels, but our margins are extremely strong. And that's a powerful tailwind to take into the recovery.", "Now in reviewing our results, I'm going to give you the year-over-year comparisons on a pro forma basis, and that is they assume the combination of RSC and United Rentals for the second quarter of last year.", "Now the standout for the quarter was EBITDA. We reported $549 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is up $76 million from last year. And we grew EBITDA more than twice the rate of revenue. Now that should tell you how efficiently we're operating the business. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46%, and that's a record margin for the company in the second quarter and it's 370 basis points higher than last year. Our SG&A expense ratio decreased 2.2 percentage points to 12.6% for the quarter. Now we've been bringing down our SG&A for some time, and we're going to continue to make that a priority.", "Last night, we reaffirmed our 2013 outlook, which anticipates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion on total revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. And we feel comfortable with these ranges, as well as the outlook for rates, time utilization, CapEx and free cash flow.", "Well, right now, the pace of the recovery is still lukewarm, although the overall trend is improving. Seasonally-adjusted, private nonresidential construction has increased slightly year-over-year for every month except May. And our customer surveys show that our key accounts remain bullish about business conditions. In fact, our most recent surveys show that the number of customers expecting a decline is at the lowest level we've ever had on record. And demand for equipment is growing. And by the way, as of today, our time utilization is at 70.5%, which is 1 month earlier than we saw last year.", "Now demand clearly drove our second quarter results. We reported a 4% increase in rate and a 5% increase in the volume of equipment on rent. Our time utilization increased 60 basis points year-over-year to 68%, and that's a second quarter record for us as well. And we sold used equipment at a 42% margin. In other words, we're exactly where we want to be in the recovery, with higher rates, volume and utilization on a larger fleet. It tells us that the market activity is picking up, and that secular penetration is still in play. Now based on what we saw in the quarter, we're making the necessary investments to sustain our momentum. And I'll talk more about that in a minute.", "Now looking at our geography. 11 of our 14 regions had year-over-year increases in rental revenue, with the Southeast and Western Canada being especially strong. Western Canada is tied to the oil and gas sector, and the Southeast is benefiting from a rebound in the macro economy in residential, particularly in the State of Florida. Although we see a landscape that's still uneven, our scale gives us tremendous advantage. And our footprint is one of the reasons why we're performing at record levels.", "We're now focused even more intently on revenue growth, with disciplined investments in our fleet and sales force. In the second quarter, we purchased more than $730 million of new fleet to satisfy current demand and prepare for our peak season. Now that's a big vote of confidence in our operating environment and it keeps us on track with our outlook, which is to generate free cash flow between $400 million and $500 million this year. As always, we remain flexible about our growth opportunities, and our ultimate goal is to generate superior returns. And one way to do that in the recovery is by making disciplined investments in fleet. Now we could end up spending more than our current plan of $1.5 billion in gross CapEx if we feel it's warranted.", "So how are we taking the fleet to market? For one thing, we've added 93 salespeople toward our goal of 120 to 150, and we have a strong pipeline of candidates to build that number over the next 6 to 9 months. And that's a pretty good indication of the confidence that we have in our end markets. The sales force is doing a good job of opening new accounts. Our year-to-date rental revenue from new accounts through June was approximately $66 million. Now that's a healthy return in the short term, but has a much larger implication for long-term growth. We also have aggressive programs in place to reactivate dormant accounts and recapture revenue that was lost during the integration and branch consolidations, and we're ramping up our approach on both efforts and we've already generated $38 million of rental revenue this year.", "Now we also have a number of additional revenue streams feeding our rental line, all of which are showing double-digit growth year-over-year, for example, Total Control solution, which had more than 30% growth in rental revenue year-to-date, driven in large part by new installs. And we're planning to expand our specialty rental footprint by 18 locations this year, which is significant. Four of these branches are already up and running, and the rest will open in the third and fourth quarters. Five are in the Trench Safety and 13 in Power & HVAC.", "Now I've spoken about our specialty rental plans on prior calls, and we'll continue to expand these operations as part of our broader strategy. Our specialty segment had rental revenue growth of more than 20% in the quarter on an as-reported basis and a gross margin 47%. Now customers are asking for these services. Power & HVAC, in particular, has the potential to cross-sell to our construction and our industrial base. And cross-selling, in general, is an area of focus for us. When we combined with RSC, we added expertise in industrial, in tool rentals, on-site management and customer-facing technology. And we're in a better position today as a single-source provider than any time in our history, and this resonates more strongly with our larger accounts.", "Key accounts of all sizes are growing in importance as a part of our component of revenue. In the second quarter, our key account business grew by more than 6% and outperformed rental revenue overall. Now these accounts contributed $1.2 billion in the first months -- first 6 months of this year, and more than 70% of that came from National Accounts. So we're continuing to grow our National Account base through both share of wallet and new agreements.", "So you see, we have a lot of growth initiatives underway, and we feel optimistic about our end markets even in the early stage of the recovery. Our entire industry is poised for growth, and we're being very diligent about protecting our key account relationships in this environment by ensuring that they get the equipment and services they need.", "Now looking at the balance of the year, the recovery is unfolding exactly as we anticipated. And when you look at it, our strategy remains completely unchanged. We'll continue to deploy our CapEx as we see strong rates and high utilization. And we've got the timing right. Most of the fleet we've added in the second quarter was deployed by early July, so we're prepared to meet demand in our busiest period.", "We'll also continue to build up our rental revenue. We had 5% rental revenue growth in the first 6 months of this year, and we're projecting roughly 8% growth in the back half of this year. Now you know our position on revenues on prior calls. We only want to pursue profitable business and retain those customers as we expand our base. Now most importantly, we're delivering on the big picture of steady revenue growth, outsize margin expansion and deleveraging. All 3 of these goals relate directly to value creation. And as our results confirm, we're right on plan.", "Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. So over to you, Bill.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to structure my comments a little differently this morning than I normally do. We've gotten a number of questions about people wanting to understand better the year-over-year change in rental revenue and get a little bit more detail on how we think about that. So I'll spend some time talking about the drivers, as we see them, of rental revenue from last quarter to this quarter. And then last quarter, you'll all remember that we talked about the EBITDA bridge from prior year to current year in a little bit more detail, so I'll give a similar bridge this quarter. And hopefully, that will answer some questions that folks might have. And then I'll finish up just touching briefly on cash flow and flow-through and the outlook.", "So that will be the structure. But I'll remind everyone, as Mike said, that all of our comments will be on a pro forma basis as though both companies were combined in both the current period and the prior comparison period.", "So first, rental revenue. We grew rental revenue for the quarter by 4.7%. And within that, we told you that we had year-over-year rate improvement of 4.2%, and our OEC-on-Rent went up 5.1%. That's our volume measure.", "The rate story was a story of rates getting better as we went through the quarter. We had a slow start to rate in the early part of the quarter, and then saw sequential improvement in the months of May and June that gave us nice momentum coming into the second quarter. And as we sit here in the early part of the second quarter, the way we've characterized our rate performance is rates are coming in well.", "On the fleet growth side, OEC-on-Rent up 5.1%. That's been developing well as well. We've gotten nice momentum over the last few months in putting more fleet on rent. As Mike said, the additional CapEx that we brought in during the quarter has gone out on rent very, very robustly. And so there's good momentum coming out of Q2 into Q3 around OEC-on-Rent growth as well. And Mike called out the time utilization that we're seeing right here now, north of 70%. So 5.1% volume growth as measured by OEC-on-Rent increase year-over-year.", "Re-rent was a little bit of a headwind for us in the current quarter. We were down on re-rent this year by almost $8 million compared to last year's comparable quarter. And so when you convert that into a percentage impact, it's something like an 0.8% decline year-over-year. So rates are up 4.2%. Volume is up 5.1%. Re-rent as a separate item was down 0.8%, netting down that rate and volume impact.", "In prior periods, we've talked a lot about mix as being sort of the other missing part of our year-over-year revenue growth, and we've talk broadly about it as an impact from the shift in rental periods. The truth is that there is more detail to that mix calculation than we've talked about more publicly. We try to simplify things in the past, but the questions that we've gotten from investors tell us that we need to give a little bit more detail. So we decided to start talking a little bit more about the replacement CapEx inflation effect that, in prior periods, we had baked in with the overall mix impact.", "So inflation impact on OEC is really just the impact of the fact that when we replace equipment, we're replacing equipment that, in the current quarter, on average, is about 7 years old. We buy a unit today at a price that's inflated compared to what it is that we sold out of our fleet as used. In the last 7 years, our equipment inflation has averaged something around 2% a year. So typically, when we replace a unit today, we're replacing a unit at a cost that's 15% higher than the old unit. And that replacement effect, that inflation effect increases OEC-on-Rent. So what we do is we break out that inflation impact on OEC-on-Rent and look at it as a separate item. When you do that calculation in the current quarter, the inflation effect by itself is about a 2% headwind. So previously, we would have just lumped that in with mix. But I think going forward, we'll call it out so that it will help explain the revenue performance that we deliver. So the 2% number is a number that's right around what we've seen for a number of quarters. And I think it's fair to say that, as you're modeling things, you should think about inflation at 2% going on as we go forward as well.", "The remainder of our year-over-year rental revenue growth is what we would truly call mix. It's about a 1.8% headwind in the current quarter, and it really is everything else that's going on in our revenue growth. So it is period mix shift, yes, but it's also a host of other things, like the currency effects, like the ancillary revenue impact in this particular quarter, like a host of other things, working day count changes. All of that gets lumped into that mix calculation in the way that we talk about the year-over-year growth in rental revenue. But we thought, again, that it made sense to give you the components. So for the 4.7% growth for rental revenue overall, rate was up 4.2%, volume was up 5.1%, re-rent was down 0.8%, replacement CapEx inflation was down 2%, and mix and all other was down 1.8%. I think that's probably the more useful way of thinking about our year-over-year rental revenue change.", "I'd also like to spend a little time talking about the bridge from last year to this year on EBITDA, and it will be very similar to what we did in the first quarter. So as we look at the key drivers of that $549 million of EBITDA that we delivered this year, obviously, the rental rate impact is pretty significant. So that 4.2% year-over-year rate improvement translates into about $33 million worth of EBITDA increase, and that's essentially taking the 4.2% rate and applying it to the prior year owned equipment revenue percentage and then knocking off a couple of percent to represent commission expense. So $33 million of incremental EBITDA from rate alone.", "Volume, and again, volume calculated the same way as I just talked about in revenue, volume contributed about $27 million of incremental EBITDA. And that comes from the 5.1% OEC-on-Rent growth that we told you about earlier, applied to the prior period's owned equipment rental revenue, and then we apply a 70% flow-through factor to get to the EBITDA impact on that line.", "Synergies. We told you that we delivered $60 million of synergies in the current quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, that $60 million compares to $17 million of synergies that we had in Q2 of last year. And so the year-over-year impact of synergies is $43 million, which was just a straight difference between this year and last year. By the way, on synergies, I might just add that the impact of synergies on our flow-through drove us to an overall flow-through for the quarter of 103%. If you take out those synergies, the flow-through x synergies was a little north of 44% in the current quarter. And I'll touch on that again as I update the outlook a little bit later.", "Used equipment sales were a pretty robust improvement for us this year compared to last year. Used equipment contributed an incremental $16 million to EBITDA in the current quarter, driven by higher used equipment volume and better margins. We continue to see very, very good sales through our retail channel. And as you all know, that gives us the best margin of all the channels that we participate in. 59% of our sales were through retail in the current quarter, and the margin performance showed that effect. So used sales contributed $16 million year-over-year.", "What are the headwinds? We told you about 5S implementation expense and OEC-not-available reduction efforts in the first quarter. We call those 2, combined, about $10 million impact in the first quarter. In the second quarter, those 2 combined were about a $6 million headwind. It played out as we expected. We reduced the level of expense, although they didn't go away completely during the second quarter. Looking forward, I think it is fair to say that the OEC -- excuse me, the 5S expense and the OEC-not-available special expense are essentially done for the year. So if you're modeling, I would say that those go to 0 for the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis.", "We had a merit increase impact in the second quarter of about $6 million, the $6 million headwind year-over-year. That's comparable to the $5 million that we called out in the first quarter. Also, in the second quarter, we had an impact from an adjustment to our self-insurance reserves. The irony here is that the impact in the second quarter alone was actually positive. It was an adjustment in our favor by about $3 million in the quarter. But in the prior year's quarter, we had an even larger favorable adjustment of $9 million. So the net impact there year-over-year is about $6 million of headwind in the second quarter.", "I talked about inflation earlier. If you take that inflation impact on revenue that I talked about earlier and apply a 70% flow-through to that inflation revenue impact, that represented a headwind in the quarter of something like $12 million at EBITDA. And everything else, which is mix and all other effects, aggregated to about a $13 million headwind. So all of those are the pieces that explain the change in EBITDA from $473 million last year to $549 million in the current quarter. Hopefully that level of detail is helpful for people, and it gives you a little bit more insight into how we think about it. If not, please ask whatever questions you think appropriate in Q&A.", "Real quickly, on cash flow and liquidity for the quarter. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of $77 million, and that includes, obviously, the rental fleet investment that we made and other investments that we made. Rental fleet, we've invested just a little over $1 billion so far in the year, on our way to $1.5 billion outlook that we've given you for the full year. And as Michael mentioned, we're confident we'll be able to deploy not only the fleet we've already bought, but any incremental fleet that we buy, very effectively. And we are taking a look at whether the $1.5 billion is the number -- the right number to stick to at this point.", "Liquidity overall is still pretty strong for us. We have been working to execute the share repurchase program that we announced last year. We're essentially done with that program, as we said. At the end of the quarter, we had $15 million left to do against the $200 million authorization that we have. As we sit here today, we've reduced that remaining amount even further. We'll get it finished during the course of this current quarter.", "Let me just finish up updating our outlook. As Michael said, we're reaffirming the elements of our outlook. So we fully expect that our total revenue for the year -- for the full year will come in, in that range that we've given previously, $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion for total revenue. Within rental revenue, we're still looking for our rates to improve by 4.5% for the quarter full year over the prior year. And time utilization, we should deliver 68%, which would be a 50-basis-point improvement over the full year 2012. The EBITDA result, again, we're reaffirming the $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion range that we've given for EBITDA, and that reflects $1.5 billion of gross rental capital spend and just about $1,050,000,000 of net rental capital expenditures. Free cash flow in the year, again, we're sticking with the $400 million to $500 million on the year. And I'll just reemphasize the flow-through point. As we look at the full year, we still expect to deliver overall flow-through, excluding synergies, of between 60% and 70% for the year.", "That's about all I'll do on a prepared basis here. But again, if there are any questions about anything that I've said, please feel free to ask it in Q&A. So I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So just on the pull-through margin assumption, the 60% to 70% for the year, I guess, can you just tell us are there any of these expenses that we should be thinking about for the third quarter, fourth quarter, things that could come up that we're not aware of? I know that some of these expenses go away, the 5S and the OEC-not-available. But the merit increases and incentive comp and things, can you just help us understand what could be out there for the second half to help us get to the 60% to 70% number? It's a big range.", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, it's certainly the range that we've talked about historically. I think the one thing I would point to, that it's hard to forecast whether we'll have or not, is the self-insurance reserve adjustment. As I said, it was a $6 million headwind in the current quarter. We don't -- we update our estimates for the self-insurance reserves twice a year. We do that in March and October, I believe. It's hard to say what that might do in the latter part of this year, but our view right now is that I wouldn't -- if I were modeling, I wouldn't model an incremental impact from self-insurance reserves. OEC-not-available, 5S go away, as I said. And those are the key things that we've experienced so far that I would say would go away. The possibility is that -- again, that we might have a self-insurance adjustment late in the year. But it's hard to say what that might look like on a year-over-year basis right here.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I guess, if I could just slide in another one. On the rate increase, the rate guidance for the year, it seemed to -- it was a little bit lower than what I was thinking for the quarter. I mean, can you just talk about the competitive environment? Are you seeing -- are your competitors being rational, both the bigger national guys, and also, are you seeing any increased pressure from the smaller independent operators?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Seth, it's Matt. We actually are seeing the competition to be pretty responsible. We're comfortable that the whole industry realizes that this is important for us all. You may have some one-offs in an individual market. But I'd say all the public companies specifically are doing a great job of rate discipline, and we're seeing the benefit of the demand as well. And we know what the headwind we have to meet our full year rate number. But historically, we've achieved what we need to achieve to get to our guidance, and we have a laser-focus on it.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Are you seeing a lot re-fleeting from the local independent guys?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Not across the board.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Could you address -- you alluded on the prepared remarks that you could do a little bit of upside to the CapEx, and that implies the strong demand environment, and you just addressed the price a little bit. What types of fleet are in demand? What have you bought? What are you buying? If you could takes us a little bit deeper on that.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, let me just kind of tell you, since I talked about the idea of the capital side, keep in mind, our principles have not changed. It's about profitable growth, higher returns and it's also about generating cash flow to reduce our leverage. Those principles have not changed, to be clear. We have to balance rate and time. As Matt said, we're looking at the rate. Both of those have to be played out. The one thing that I will tell everybody, if you go back to our earlier messaging, we originally were only going to have 9 locations, cold starts in our specialty business. We're now doubling that. That does take up some capital. But as I mention, at 40% margin, it's very attractive and accretive. So we think it's the right thing to do. That's probably in the order of $30 million to $40 million. Everything is under review. Nothing has been decided. We want to continue to see the nice progression we've seen on time utilization and that demand, and specifically on rates. So Matt can talk specifics on what kind of assets.", "Matthew J. Flannery", "As Mike had mentioned, the really only big change over our current product mix is much more focus on the specialty products. And that's in line with the direction that we want to go strategically. We think not only are they profitable, but it's a differentiator between us and the marketplace and a value for our customers.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And is there a big difference -- I see key account growth up 6% in the quarter, unassigned accounts up 1.5%. Is there a big difference in what you purchase for each of those target groups?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "I wouldn't say that there's a big difference. One of the opportunities that we are finding and we have found since the merger of RSC is the increased need and demand for us to cross-sell, and we've got great results from that. So I'd say that's one of the more significant changes for our key accounts, is the legacy RSC customers are now getting access to Trench, Power & HVAC product, and we're cross-selling our tools across the network as well. So those would be the most significant key account differences.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was hoping just to ask, maybe to start on guidance. At this point, what would be kind of the key factors that drive you towards the upper end of the revenue and EBITDA guidance? Would it more likely be pricing over volume? And the same question on EBITDA, would it be pricing, volume, cost/synergy? Just if you could help frame out kind of what you think the key drivers would be, I guess both the drivers at the upper end and then what the biggest risks could be that could drive it the other way.", "William B. Plummer", "Ted, I'll start, and Mike and Matt, please chime in. Look, we all know the leverage that rate has in our business. So if we got a little bit more pricing, I think that would have the most outsized impact overall. So that would almost always have to go to the top of the list of what might drive us to that higher end of the range. But volume is a very significant lever for us right here and now. It's going well. And so if the market momentum that we see today continues or even increases a little bit, that could be a significant driver to push us toward the top end of the range. And then the synergies could be a pleasant surprise as well. The synergies have developed according to plan so far. They're going nicely. If we saw a little bit more strength in some of the synergy areas that are still developing, right -- many of the synergies are baked. They're done, right? The actions have been taken. The branches have been closed. The headcount has been reduced. But we're now at the synergies that require a process change and development of tools. If some of those pan out better than we expected, we could see a lift from synergies as well. And then if, for some reason, we decided to spend a little bit more on capital, that could be a driver as well. I guess, you'd count that as volume, but I'm counting that as volume that we trigger versus volume that's driven by the marketplace. So those are the, I'd call it, 4 things that I would look at that, say, could push us toward the high end of that range. [indiscernible]", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Look, Ted, I completely agree with Bill. I think rate would be #1 and the synergy and cost would be #2. Those probably, to me, would be the 2 biggest buckets.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess just digging into that pricing comment, if we look at your comps in the third quarter and fourth quarter, just on a single and a double, they look like they're relatively static first and second quarter. Are there programs in place that could help you improve reported pricing on a year-on-year basis in the back half? I know you're reaffirming the 4.5%, but how would you encourage us to think about the potential to do maybe a little better than that 4.2% we saw in the second quarter?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, one of the things I would say, you're right. To be clear, I mean, was it a little bit slower than I would have hoped for? Absolutely. But the team is always up for the challenge and they've always been able to meet or exceed my expectations. That being said, it's supported by strong time utilization, so we'll see that continue to play out. On top of that, we do have our systems in place that we use. We use Zilliant, as you're very much familiar with, as a way in which we go to market. And it's not only the top line rate, it's also taking off the bottom part of the underperforming rates that can drive that outcome. So I would just tell you that we're laser-focused on it. I feel very confident in the team, and time utilization is a benefactor for us. So to the extent that we continue to see the time utilization, that 70.5% right here and now, a month early, if that continues, I feel we'll deliver.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Great. And then second question was on SG&A. And I know in your prepared remarks, Michael, you said that that's a key focus for you guys. It looked great, so congratulations on that. Normally, you'll see that number tick up sequentially. That obviously had a nice tick down, more synergies and more efficiencies. But how should we think about that as a kind of run rate going forward? And can you just walk through maybe some of the puts and takes that helped you to do as well this quarter as you did?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, I'll start out, and then I'll ask Bill to walk you through it. But it's fair to say that when we think about profitable growth, it's not all about rate and it's not all about the customers that we serve. It's also in the way in which we go to market and driving efficiencies, that efficiencies have not only played out in the field as a cost to ramp, but it's also in the SG&A. How can we have a more effective sales force? How can we do things more effectively? How can we streamline the processes that we have in place? All those things will play. We've made -- we started out several years ago talking about driving cost down, and we've shifted towards talking more about efficiencies. That hasn't changed, and we still remain focused on finding ways to do that. And I'm a disciple of growing the top line, but at the same time, expanding -- reducing costs to grow the bottom line in a combination. So Bill will give you a walk-through in some reoccurring and some data points.", "William B. Plummer", "So Ted, you will see a sequential increase in SG&A from Q2 to Q3. Without quantifying it, I'd say, clearly, Q3 is our highest revenue quarter. And so you'll see selling costs be a significant part of that sequential increase, and that's probably going to be the biggest driver of the sequential change. What has driven the SG&A improvement that we've seen, especially the year-over-year improvement that we saw this year? Two factors: one is salary and benefit improvement, and that -- I'm talking the total number here -- that reflected the synergy actions that we took during the second quarter last year, really having a full effect in the second quarter of this year on a comparison basis. So that's been a big chunk of it. And the other big chunk is bad debt expense. As we were early in the merger last year in the second quarter, slowly we started to build some older receivables as we transitioned through systems and trained people and figured out a new working relationship with customers. During the second quarter, we start to see our bad debt expense start to rise. We've got a better handle on all of those actions. Right? Systems are now bedded in. People are more comfortable with using those systems, our customers -- and we have a better understanding of how we're working together. And so we're starting to see the age of our receivables balance come down in the second quarter. That was a significant contributor on a year-over-year basis. Will we get as much of that benefit in the third quarter? Maybe not quite as much, but we'll see a nice benefit there as well. So that might add to -- that might offset a little bit the sequential increase that I talked about for commission expense. Those are the biggest things that I'd point to right here and now on SG&A, both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. Is that helpful?", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "That's incredibly helpful, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of David Raso from ISI Group.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "The last 4 quarters, your sales growth has been notably slower than some of the major competitors. Just keep it open ended as a question, I'd like to hear your explanation why and maybe how is that influencing your decision on CapEx for what you just experienced in 2Q and how you're thinking about the rest of the year.", "William B. Plummer", "So David, I'll start off. I think -- well, I don't spend a lot of time wallowing in the competitors metrics. I do know that in some key cases, they're growing their fleet robustly right here and now. Our fleet is growing, as we said earlier, 5.1% using nominal OEC dollars. And so that's a robust foundation. If you're pumping your fleet up 15%, 20%, that's a very strong underpinning for growth. We know because we were growing our fleet in the high teens, 4, 5, 6 quarters ago, if you go back and take a look. And we were delivering revenue growth in the 20%-plus area. So I think that's a big factor that's going on. Another factor is the customer segments that we focus on. Our large key accounts, I would argue, experienced a rebound earlier in the cycle than some of the midsized and smaller accounts that some of our competitors rely upon. So the timing of the customer segment that they're focused on is playing to their benefit right here and now. It played to our benefit earlier in the recovery cycle, and so that's another, I think, important factor. So those are the 2 things that I would point to. Mike or Matt, would you guys add anything on top of that?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "What I would add, David, is, keep in mind, we closed 200 locations. So we knew going in that we would have a dis-synergy. That dis-synergy comes much quicker. And then we build our way out of it. As I mentioned, we're looking at the dormant accounts, and we're growing that. And so Bill is right. It's a different strategy, and we're very happy with what we -- how we look at the world and the principles that we've laid out for profitable growth, higher returns and cash flow.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I think we're all just trying to figure out the run rate for rental rates and the delicate balance you always have between growth of fleet versus rate, and how do we think about rate versus fleet growth into '14. Because if I look at the rental rate growth for the full year, the 4.5%, obviously, the OEC-on-Rent, especially with the way the July utilization started strongly, that appears from your fleet utilization/average OEC, that's probably upside to the targets. But the rate of 4.5%, it would seem like a bit of a challenge. So can you educate us a little bit, maybe more detail on how are thinking about rate in the third and fourth quarter? And I'd probably weave that into how should I think about that interplay going into next year? Because a lot of the long-only's are thinking about the stock is, if they can grow nicely and generate a lot of cash, it's not just enjoying the cycle, you're enjoying an improving company, better return on capital, the whole story. But to grow the top line more by fleet, I might have to forego some of that cash flow. So I'm just trying to think of that balance. So if we can go back, how are you thinking about rates the next couple of quarters to get to the 4.5%? Or is it probably more of a -- maybe you missed the rate target a bit, but you have the upside to the fleet utilization? And then dovetail that into 2014 thoughts.", "William B. Plummer", "Yes. So again, I'll start and ask for input, Mike and Matt. As we think about the back half of the year, the math is pretty clear, right? You got 5.4% year-over-year in the first quarter on rate. You got 4.2% in the second quarter. And so in order to get to the 5.5% -- or excuse me, 4.5%, maybe that's Freudian, 4.5% for the full year, the back half has got to be somewhere around 4% growth. And the quarters will break out differently based on the comps last year, right? Third quarter last year, we had a very strong rate improvement, and so that will be a difficult comparison in Q3 for this year. So somewhere between 4% and 4.2% is where the back half has got to be, and the third quarter is probably biased a little lower and the fourth quarter a little higher than that. So that's the way that we're thinking about rate to finish out this year, and it leads into the 2014 comment. In 2014, we'll follow years in which -- if we do what we say this year, we'll follow years in which we had rate at 4.5%, what was it was, 6.9% last year, folks? Somebody remind me. And it was 5-and-change percent the year before that. Those are very strong consecutive years when you look back at the history of not only this company, but this industry. And so it's hard sitting here right now to say we're going to stack another 4% or 5% rate on top of that, but that's the kind of thing that we ask ourselves as we think about 2014. Should we expect another 4% or 5% in 2014? That's a tough thing to decide right here and now. But it's in the neighborhood of where rate should be next year. So let's say it's, I'll pick a number, in that area of 4% to 5%. So let's say it's in that area. What can we do to generate profitability, margin, return and cash flow in that scenario? We would look at that question and ask, importantly, what's the fleet investment assumption that we want to put underneath that? What we've said so far is that we want to think about fleet investments over the next several years that are in the neighborhood of what we're doing this year and what we did last year. If we do that, then the cash flow generation is very robust over the next few years. But that limits us to something in the high-single digits of fleet growth over the next few years. So the thing that we're struggling with -- not struggling -- discussing right here and now is, is that the scenario that you want to play out over the next several years. That's our mindset right here and now. And if we do it the way we've been talking about, we'll get a lot of free cash flow over the next few years.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And that's kind of why I asked the question the way I did. I mean, if you feel you need to look at your peers, and I know they're growing the fleet more, but still you're truly not growing nearly as fast. If you feel we can't have that much of a -- at least optically, it looks like you're losing share. We have to go after the fleet expansion. That might be able to close the gap on the revenue growth, but you clearly begin to give away the cash flow target that you set of $2 billion in aggregate, 13', 14' and 15'. It sounds like you're still feeling the balance should be -- look, we're not trying to chase the double-digit top line growth. We're trying to get the returns, and the cash flow is still a pretty high priority.", "William B. Plummer", "I think that's fair, and, Mike, please offer your view. But I don't think we feel like we've got to deliver double digit or near 20% revenue growth. I don't think that's where any of us have our heads set right here and now. We're focused on profitable growth. We're focused on doing it in the context of managing our leverage, and that means free cash flow. We can grow and we can improve margins, and we can improve return and deliver significant free cash flow over the next few years all at the same time. That's where we are as a company in this current cycle, and we feel pretty confident about that. The details of whether it's 5% growth a year or 7% or 8%, I think, would inform the exact amount of free cash flow that we generate. But that's the neighborhood that were talking about rather than saying, \"Oh, we've got to be up at 15% or 20%.\"", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, I agree with everything that Bill just said. David, the one thing, if we -- this 4.5%, just leading into 2014, you can assume a carryover of somewhere around 2% going into next year. And then you take a look at what some of the industry analysts are saying about the end markets, it actually is -- it grows, so that it should, again, support more rate and higher returns. And Bill is exactly right. We're not -- we've never said that -- or pounded the table on double-digit growth. We're pounding the table on profitable growth and higher returns and cash flow and delevering.", "William B. Plummer", "I don't want to get on my soapbox here. But I mean, we're in a phase now where we're delivering, if we do what we say, $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow, while growing our fleet, while improving our time utilization, while improving margins, while improving returns. There are a lot of things lined up right here and now, and we think we can extend that run over the next several years. And to give up all of that in pursuit of just absolute top line growth is not where our heads are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.", "Ishan Singh", "This is Ishan on for Manish. Just a quick question. I know you get this every quarter now and then. I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the M&A environment, given there appears to be a number of opportunities out there in the market right now.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, this is Mike. We've said this time and time again. It has to be, as we call it, the three-legged stool. It has to be strategic. It's not like we have to run out and buy somebody for the sake of getting big. Big is not the endgame here. It has to be accretive, and there has to be a cultural fit with our company. And I think the success that we have with RSC speaks volumes of how we approached it. Do we look at things that are out there? Absolutely. But again, our principles are out there. As these things come available or come across our desk, we'll look at them as we should. But again, it has to fit those 3 buckets, and it has to fit with our long-term strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Michael, can you talk about the opportunities to continue to improve fleet availability or reduce fleet not available, now that you've got RSC under your belt for an extended period of time here? Is there a 1-year-plus opportunity to continue to improve and drive higher equipment utilization rates longer term?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Short answer is yes. But I'm going to start, and I'm going to ask Matt to chime in because it's a project that we've announced, it's underway here inside the company. But we're doing a lean process, and we're taking a look at our processes. And we do think that there is an opportunity to improve the day-to-day operations and streamline things, take out redundancies and effectively get better results, not only from the turn that we have from fleet coming in, but also fleet going out. And we're very excited about that. Matt?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Yes, Jerry, Mike is absolutely right. I mean, on average, we have stores that have 30% more fleet year-over-year, and some of them significantly more than that. So we've got a new scale coming through these locations, and it's a great time for us, after the year anniversary, to start looking at our new business model and how can we get waste out of the model and improve efficiency. At the end of the day, that's the output that we're looking for, and we've got a lot of folks focused on that. And we think that we'll see that throughout the next few years. And part of that is the gap that we're going to fill between the $230 million to the $250 million range that we want to get in synergies. It's going to come out of the shop, as Bill stated earlier. It's a little more, I won't say, complex but it's more process-oriented, and it's going to take time to achieve. And that's where our focus is.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And a follow-up just on the broader demand environment. To get to your pricing number, you really need to get pricing accelerating into 3Q to a rate of improvement of closer to 1 point a month from roughly half that amount in June. And I'm just wondering, based on the increase that you see or backlog of work that you see, are you on track to ramp up to that level of sequential price increases? And how would you characterize the demand environment in 3Q versus 2Q on a seasonally adjusted basis?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "So the demand environment is very strong. As we discussed, time utilization is a point higher than it was last year. We reached the 70% threshold at least 30 days earlier than we did last year. And the sequential rate improvement, we're very aware of the sequential rate that we need throughout the balance of the year to reach our target, and it has been achieved. And if you look, the third quarter, over the last few years, is our largest sequential improvement. And we know it's going to take more focus than it has because of the slower start, and we're putting that appropriate focus. But it is achievable or we wouldn't have reaffirmed that guidance. So we know exactly what that's going to take to do it, and the team is focused on it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "My question is with regard to the flow-through calculation in the press release and, Bill, your comments regarding that. I'm having a hard time calculating it. If I take the $549 million of EBITDA minus the $418 million of last year divided by the $1,206 million of revenue minus the $993 million, I get to about $61.5 million versus the $102 million in the spreadsheet -- in the press release, what am I missing?", "William B. Plummer", "So the prior year pro forma adjusted number is $473 million as a starting point compared to the $549 million, so that year-over-year in total is -- somebody do the math for me -- $76 million. And then the revenue change is $74 million in the period. So say again, Phil, what were the other numbers that you're using?", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So the ones in the press release are not the ones you're using. You're using the pro forma numbers from last year's release.", "William B. Plummer", "That is correct.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just to go back to the M&A question, do you have enough dots on the map? I mean, you've got 820-some-odd locations. It seems to me that you wouldn't really need to add any more general rental locations. You just simply now are going to add more units per location and that should increase your EBITDA margin and increase the economies of scale. Is that the way you guys are thinking of it?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Generally, yes. Phil, this is Matt. I mean, there may be gaps based on upcoming projects, and specifically in Canada, where we may have a gen-rent cold start or 2 planned. But that's why our focus is on our specialty business. Because even if they share real estate, we always look at that opportunity. We do want to build out the footprint of our specialty product. It's a huge growth goal of ours and a strategic focus. So as far as the 836 and the gen-rent footprint, it is fairly robust, and we don't have really any gaps to fill.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then just on that specialty piece, it would be 18 locations, how soon? Are those third quarter events or is that fourth quarter?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "It will depend to the timing of getting the real estate and getting the employees, but it is a number that we feel we can achieve in the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from Keybanc.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick clarification. Bill, that was helpful on the mix and the inflation impact. As we think about the rental revenue walk going forward, should we expect the impact from national customers to still be a negative mix headwind, but maybe less than in the past couple of quarters as you anniversary the RSC deal?", "William B. Plummer", "I don't know that I'd point to national specifically, but what I would say is that the mix impact -- so excluding inflation, the remainder, we're calling mix, will likely continue to be a negative. I won't characterize the size of it, but I think that dynamic of continuing to mix more toward the larger players who do rent longer typically, so you've got that period mix dynamic going on, a little bit of Cat class mix that's influenced by the growth of the larger Strategic Accounts, and then just all the other puts and takes that flow through that number. I would expect that to continue to be a headwind over the next several quarters.", "Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And Mike, can you maybe just give us a little bit more color on regional demand in the quarter and maybe just comment on the weather impact? Obviously, we had a lot of rain this year versus last. Just any thoughts on how much weather could have impacted the numbers.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, you know me, I don't like to hide under the covers around weather. But of the 3 regions that we basically talked about that were down on a year-over-year basis, clearly, one of them was impacted by weather; the other one, which is Northeast Canada, and Northeast Canada, we knew it was going to be down on a year-over-year basis. And they did -- also are going through a union issue in the province of Qu\u00e9bec. That has had some impact, so we expect that. The other regions -- I think the other regions that we -- the Gulf South that we talked about, it was the third one. That was more of a timing issue related to its projects, and they're back online. And the rest of them came up very nicely on a year-over-year basis. When you look at the 2 performing ones, obviously, you can take the Southeast, which I think was really impacted by the downturn severely, has come back strong, both from residential and on the construction side. And then the Western Canadian region still performs very well due to the oil and gas sector that's out there. And as long as the oil stays up, it will do and perform exceptionally well.", "Operator", "And due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to turn the program back to management for any further remarks.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. And I want to thank everybody for joining us today. If you go on to our website, you can see our investor site, where you can download our latest presentation. We're also settling into our new offices here in Stamford, Connecticut. We have relocated from Greenwich.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

You can access these filings on the company's website at www.ur.com.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome today. With me today, as the operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officers; and other members of our senior management team.", "Now you may have noticed that we reported our results yesterday prior to the market close. That's because our release was inadvertently made available to employees at that time. So we made the prudent decision to distribute our release publicly.", "Now as you saw, we turned in some strong results, particularly in terms of margin. Historically, the third quarter is our most robust period, and that was true in 2012 and it was true again this year when our rental revenues increased by more than 8%. But more importantly, our results as a whole reflect 2 dynamics that are essential to our strategy.", "First, our nonresidential construction spending is recovering, although the pace is still very modest. And the bulk of the upswing is expected to come in 2014 and 2015. But demand is definitely improving, and we're getting a benefit from that. And the second, the quarter reflects our ability to generate significant value even from a small improvement in our operating environment. Remember, it was only a few years ago that we had the goal of adjusted EBITDA at only 40% margin, and this is the sixth straight quarter that we've exceeded that percentage. Now, obviously, our sights are set higher, but our objective remains the same, and that is to create value by improving our margins and driving better returns.", "Now Bill will discuss our performance in more detail in a few minutes, and then after that, we can go to the Q&A. But before I move on, I want to mention the share repurchase program we announced last night. Our Board of Directors has authorized up to $500 million in share repurchases, which we expect to execute over the next 18 months. Now this was carefully considered use of cash, and it's consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes balancing organic growth while maintaining leverage within the target range of 2.5 to 3.5x over the cycle and returning cash to shareholders, while at the same time remaining our flexibility to do M&A. Now if you have any questions about that program, we'll address those as well during the Q&A. So let's move on to the quarter.", "As you saw last night, our adjusted EBITDA was $642 million, and our margin was a record 49%. Now that's $72 million increase compared to our third quarter last year, and that puts us just over $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA through September. We reaffirmed our outlook for adjusted EBITDA between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion this year, and we have good reasons to be confident about that target.", "Now first, as I mentioned, there's no question that we're seeing more demand from our services. And while the upswing is modest compared to what we think we'll see next year, it has given us enough traction to grow the business. But there's more than just the construction recovery behind our revenue improvement, and we're executing our strategy extremely well in this environment. And you can see it in the components of our revenue increase year-over-year.", "For the third quarter, we drove an 8.2% increase in volume in our rent, a 3.2% increase in rental rates; and time utilization of 70.8%, and that's 100 basis points higher than last year. As I said many times, it's always a balancing act between rates and utilization. And you can see it in the third quarter that we had solid improvement in rates and an exceptional level of utilization, and still, our rates are on a good trajectory. In fact, rates were up overall in every major category in the quarter year-over-year. And on a sequential basis, rates trended up each month versus last year, and we're standing behind our outlook for full year rate increase of at least 4%. Now I want to emphasize that we're never complacent about rate improvements at any level. Our mindset is that we can always do better, and you'll see us continue to push for rate in 2014 and beyond.", "We're also maintaining a tight cost discipline and continuing to harvest synergies from the merger with RSC. We realized $64 million of synergies in the quarter, and we expect to meet our goal of $230 million to $250 million in annual synergies.", "Now turning to the marketplace. One of the hallmarks of a genuine recovery's nonresidential construction is in its footprint. And that's in between [ph] a regional fluctuation to a true turnaround. In the third quarter, all but one of our regions showed growth in rental revenues, with 8 regions showing double-digit improvement. It's also encouraging that growth comes from a mix of projects, not just 1 sector. In the Mountain West, for example, we have machines on-site at a football stadium, a university expansion, an airport expansion and a new health care facility under construction. And we're also servicing in oil, projects in oil, gas, mining, distribution and solar, and that's all within 1 region. So organic growth was a major factor in our quarter, but we also expanded our specialty network, with an eye towards driving returns in future periods.", "In August, we announced the opening of greenfield locations in San Diego, in Oklahoma City and in Fort McMurray, Alberta, and these were all Power HVAC branches. Our specialty operations reported an impressive year-over-year growth of nearly 25% for the quarter, and 19% of that was same-store growth. So we're doing a good job of cross-selling our services and building a reputation as a single-source provider.", "Now all of our growth initiatives are carefully calculated to give us near-term and long-term results. This applies to our M&A activity, like our acquisition of Rent World in August, as well as new branch openings, sales force expansion, investments in technology and a whole range of other options at our disposal. It also applies to our CapEx. We treat our CapEx like any other growth initiative, and we allocate our cash, what would drive results and attractive return.", "Now through the first 9 months of this year, we spent just under $1.5 billion on new equipment rental. That puts us on a path to spend $1.6 billion in total. We're investing in equipment that we know that our customers need, and we're constantly always fine-tuning that mix.", "Our salespeople also do an excellent job of reading the local markets, and the money we spent on the fleet in April, May and June helped drive our numbers in the third quarter. We saw key account revenue increase by 7%, and unassigned accounts, which tend to be local customers, had revenue growth of 10.5% in the quarter. And that's good progress because as you know from our last call, these smaller accounts were the most challenging to retain during the integration.", "So our end markets are percolating, and we think they'll heat up significantly in 2014. That's also the view of many forecasters in our industry. And 2015 is expected to be even stronger, particularly for commercial construction.", "So in terms of the coming year, we'll talk more about that on the next call. But in the meantime, you'll see us continue to focus on controllable elements of our business and execute our strategy with diligence and discipline. We have a good visibility through December, and all indications are that we'll continue to show year-over-year improvement.", "Now before I close, I want to share a personal experience I had earlier this week. I had the honor of speaking at the International Rental Conference in Beijing, China, which is still very much an emerging market for rental. Their industry is facing the same challenges right now, but the energy at the rental conference was absolutely electric. Rental operators in China can see the future, and they can't wait to carve out a new industry, just as we did in North America in the '70s and '80s. While our focus remains on North America in the short term, we have the same passion for taking the business in new directions. We're the architects of our own success, and we've worked hard to bring the business to this point. And it's no accident that we find ourselves in a position to expand our fleet, delever our balance sheet and return cash to investors while pursuing numerous avenues for growth. In short, we're going to go into 2014 with every opportunity on the table.", "So with that, I'll turn to Bill -- over to Bill for the financial results. So over to you, Bill.", "William B. Plummer", "Well, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Mike hit the highlights of the quarter, so I'll try to add a little bit of color as I go through the financial results and then touch briefly on the outlook for 2013 and the share repurchase programs.", "In terms of the financial results for the quarter, as Mike said, it was a strong one within rental -- within revenue. We had a very robust rental revenue growth, up 3.8% in the quarter. You all know that rental revenue is composed of our own equipment revenue, plus re-rent revenue, plus ancillary and other revenues. In this quarter, owned equipment revenue was about 87% of the total rental revenue. And OER was up 8%. Obviously, OER is driven by our rate performance. As Mike said, it was -- the rates were up 3.2%, also driven by our volume performance. Volume was up 8.2% in the quarter. The difference between those 2 added together and the 8% OER growth was mix and other factors. Within that, mix and other inflation made up a negative 2%, and the remainder was a negative 1.3% that we point to as mix. So those were the important drivers of rental revenue. We did have a good quarter in ancillary and -- that offset a little bit of headwind in re-rent. You all know that we've been displacing re-rents with owned equipment since the merger, so we expect to see a little bit of a headwind in re-rent. So put all that together, and that explains the 8.3% improvement in rental revenue for the quarter, overall.", "I'll offer a little bit more on the volume performance in that quarter. Volume was very robust, up 8.2% in the quarter, as I said. We had OEC-on-Rent of $5.6 billion in the quarter. That's a record OEC-on-Rent quarter for us by quite a margin. To be able to have that size fleet out on rent, growing 8%-plus in the quarter on top of the increase and the size of our fleet overall, I think, makes a very strong statement about demand in the marketplace.", "Mike mentioned that the time utilization in our fleet was 70.8% in the quarter, up 100 basis points over last year. And again, that's a very robust level of time utilization for the size fleet that we have. So a really good quarter in terms of the level of demand and our ability to satisfy that demand, and we feel good about the momentum that we've carried into the fourth quarter in terms of our rental revenue.", "I'll touch briefly on used equipment sales, another good strong quarter for us in used. We had $102 million of used proceeds in the quarter, and those revenues came at a 48% adjusted gross margin, a very robust margin result for us as well. A big driver, which has been the case for the last several quarters, is the shift in the channel mix. Our retail channel just contributes more and more every quarter. Retail sales this quarter represented 62.6% of all of our used equipment sales, and that's 9 percentage points more through the retail channel than last year. So that strong retail channel mix, along with what is still a very robust pricing environment for used equipment, contributed to that 48% adjusted gross margin in the quarter on used. So used continues to contribute nicely to our results, and we look to continue that going forward as well.", "Let me turn to profitability at EBITDA. Mike mentioned $462 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the 49% EBITDA margin. I guess that's a little repetitive, but it's fun to say. So I'll say it again, 49% EBITDA margin. All right, thanks. That was for me. And that was an improvement, a nice improvement over the prior year, $72 million of improved EBITDA performance over the prior year or 220 basis points in margin improvement.", "To bridge that $72 million year-over-year EBITDA change, I would break it out as follows: the 3.2% rental rate increase flows through to an EBITDA impact of $27 million in the quarter. That increase in OEC-on-Rent, the 8.2% volume increase that I mentioned, flows through at $48 million of volume impact to EBITDA. We had a year-over-year improvement in our synergy results. We delivered $64 million of synergy in the quarter. That compares to $45 million last year, so $19 million of improved synergy results in the quarter. Used sales contributed $8 million more in gross profit for the quarter. We had a particularly nice bad debt expense result in the quarter of $5 million improvement compared to last year. And so those were all of the positives that we had in that $72 million year-over-year impact working against those fleet inflation. We started talking about that last quarter a little bit more explicitly. If you take the impact of the fleet that we sold as used through the quarter, we sold $189 million of OEC in the quarter. That fleet -- replacing that fleet at current prices had an impact at EBITDA of about $12 million unfavorable.", "Along with that, we had an impact of a couple of other items. Delivery expense was a little higher in the quarter, unfavorable by $8 million. That's really driven partly by timing of expense invoices year-over-year but also most strongly by the fact that we've now improved the deliveries per driver within our system very effectively to the point where we have to use a little bit more outside hauling. And so that was the main contributor to that $8 million unfavorability in delivery expense.", "We talked previously about merit increases. They took effect early in the year. The impact in the quarter was an unfavorable $5 million in the quarter. And everything else lumped together, we'll call mix and others, was an unfavorable $10 million in the quarter. So those were the key pieces to the total $72 million year-over-year improvement that we had in EBITDA.", "If you take that $72 million against the total revenue changes that we had, the flow-through to adjusted EBITDA this quarter was 78.3% in total, and obviously, that includes the $19 million of year-over-year improvement in synergies. If you exclude the synergy impact, our flow-through was a little north of 58% in the quarter, excluding synergies. And that's putting us in line to deliver a flow-through, x synergy, for the full year that's going to be about 60%.", "At EPS, you all saw the results there, adjusted EPS of $1.63 for the quarter, a very strong quarter for us and, obviously, a very nice improvement at EPS over last year.", "Moving on to free cash flow, just really briefly. Our year-to-date free cash flow usage is $84 million, and that includes the effect of our CapEx spend. As Mike said, we spent year-to-date just under $1.5 billion of gross CapEx. I'll remind you that when we talk about free cash flow, typically, we talk about it excluding the impact of merger-related expenses, just to get a clear view of how the underlying company is performing. We called it out in the press release of those expenses being $33 million in the quarter. And so I'd just remind everyone that you'd have to take that off the minus $84 million to think about the full year free cash flow the way that we think about it on a go-forward basis.", "I think that's all I'll say on the free cash flow. Real briefly on our outlook. Mike mentioned that we've reaffirmed our outlook, in particular, total revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion; free cash flow between $400 million and $500 million for the full year. We certainly feel that those ranges are appropriate. If you pressed a little harder, given the challenge that we've addressed with rental rate performance, it's more likely that will come in the lower half of those ranges, but the length -- the ranges are still effective at this point.", "In terms of the share repurchase program, again, Mike touched on that briefly, but the $500 million program, we think, is very consistent with our philosophy and approach around how we deploy the cash flow that we expect to generate over the next several years. In particular, it's fully consistent with what we've said about our desire to manage leverage to a lower level for our company. We still see leverage between 2.5x and 3.5x as being appropriate over the cycle, and we continue to expect to reduce our leverage as we go forward over the next several years, even as we execute the share repurchase program.", "That program, we expect to start executing against immediately, again, with the intent of getting it completed within 18 months. We expect to use open market purchases primarily to execute the repurchases, although we do preserve flexibility to do something in the way of an accelerated repurchase, if we think that's appropriate. But we like the flexibility that an open market program brings to us to manage all of the demands on our cash flow. The ABL will be the main source of financing for the repurchases, as we have done in our prior repurchase programs. And we feel that we're very well-positioned overall to execute this program and still be able to manage the business in the way that we think is appropriate.", "So those are the key comments that I'd offer. At this point, I'll turn it back to the operator and ask you to open up the phones for question and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess on the reaffirmed rate guidance, 4%-plus for the year, to me, it seems like that implies some improvement in the fourth quarter, north of what the 3.2% that you did here in the third quarter, maybe something in the mid to upper 3% range year-over-year. Can you give us your confidence -- what gives you confidence in hitting that kind of number? Any color on what trends you're seeing in October and maybe what that implies for a rollover into -- to start 2014?", "William B. Plummer", "Hey, Seth, it's Bill. I'll start. And, Matt, feel free to chime in as well. I think you're right. The implication mathematically is that we'll do better than the 3.2% year-over-year in fourth quarter. While we haven't given any more specific guidance than that, I think what we would say is that you -- if you look at the sequentials that we need in order to deliver at least 4% for the full year, the sequentials in the last 3 months of the year, they average out something maybe just a little shy of 0.5%. And we think that's very reasonable. And in fact, if you look at what we've experienced so far in October, it sets us up very nicely to deliver the month of October, and we feel very good about November and December on a sequential basis. So if we do what we think we can do and what we've done historically in the fourth quarter, we should be pretty good at hitting that at least 4% rate guidance. Matt, anything you want to add to it?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "No, I think Bill's touched on it. And we'll continue to see October and November sequentially improve, as we historically do.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And what would that translate to, to start the year, do you think? Is that like a 2% or low 2% range to start next year?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes. It'd be about 2% carryover, Seth.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right. Okay. And if you're doing that kind of rate, mid- to high-3s in the fourth quarter and something like that maybe next year, can you still do a 60% or 70% pull-through margin on that kind of rate gain?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, we can -- what we'd say is we'll be about 60% for the full year based on our forecast for the fourth quarter. So all of that's consistent with the flow-through about 60% in Q4. And as you look to next year, we view our base business as being a flow-through normally in that 60% to 70% range. So I'd probably say about 60% for next year as well. Obviously, we have to refine and finalize our planning process for next year, but that's the neighborhood that I think we'd be comfortable with.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Michael and Matt, I'm wondering if you can talk about, from the Total Control penetration that you've been able to achieve so far, what's the dollar impact you're seeing on your business, whether it's customer retention or lower cost of service to customer, and just frame for us where do you think Total Control can ultimately go as a proportion of your business? And then, obviously, nice progress on RSC synergies. Can you just talk about what are the next levers you're pulling to get to the multi-year synergy targets, since you've already hit your 2014 targets effectively this quarter?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Sure, Jerry. As far as your first point on Total Control, as you could see on Slide 17 of the investor deck, we've had a $28 million improvement, a 27% improvement over this time -- over Q3 last year. And we're going to continue cross-selling to new customers within the portfolio. We had over 200 prospective Total Control members at our conference that we had in Orlando last month. This is an annual conference we get to introduce the Total Control offering to existing customers, to help us enhance it, as well as bring in new opportunities. So we feel very comfortable that we'll continue to penetrate more customers with this value-added tool. As far as the synergies, as you recognize, we'll reach our $230 million to $250 million range by year-end as opposed to having to wait until 2015. And we'll continue to look for more opportunities in productivity basically in shop and driver turnarounds. And we have an ongoing lean process that we're going through to help capture some of those opportunities. So we feel very good about that and even better that we're a year ahead of schedule on achieving that $230 million to $250 million range.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, Jerry, I would only go back to the 1 comment on Total Control that Matt talked about in Orlando. We announced that we've got a whole new mobile app that we are rolling out to our current members who are signed up with it, and it has a very robust capability, as well as some GPS additions. So that gives them, really, more opportunity to manage their consumption. And so it was very well-received amongst the audience, not only current customers but, more importantly, potential customers who are looking at the valued proposition around Total Control.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And in terms of the rate that you're seeing the marketplace, can you just give us a sense what's the difference in rate increase you're seeing on the spot market basis versus your monthly business? Is there a difference in what's being put through currently?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "There's not a significant difference in the period mix, the day, week and month rate improvement. It's consistent with what we've been achieving over the last couple of years, and we don't really expect to see much variation in that either.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sorry, Matt. Just to clarify, you're seeing the same rate increases on a spot basis that you're seeing on your longer-term business?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Obviously, the contractual, if you look at a month by month by month, is a little more stable. But as far as against our goals and against our previous achievement, we're not seeing fluctuation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I'm just wondering if we could talk about the macro. I mean, if you look at nonres this year, at least on government data, it's been a little slower than expected. You guys have put up some nice volume growth. You've grown the fleet. Time utilization has been strong. Can you just talk about kind of like how you think the markets evolve year-to-date? What's your outlook in kind of the customer surveys and kind of how you think you're setting up for '14 and '15? Maybe some specificity about where you think things will accelerate or where you're most optimistic.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes. This is Mike. Let me just kind of walk you through the progression analysis that sets up where -- how you can take a look at the improvement in what we're seeing, what gives us confidence. Everyone on the call realizes that one of the leading indicators is the ABI index, and we've all been watching that every month as it comes forward. Year-to-date, there's only been 1 month that was negative in our space. When you go back to 2012, we had 3 negative months in that same period. '11, we had 4, and '10, we had 8. So you can see the reduction that you're seeing a negative in most of them, all with the exception of 1 month this year, we saw a positive growth component in that arena. Step back and take a look at residential construction. Residential construction continues to improve, and that's usually another leading indicator. Roughly, around 18 months after residential starts to improve, you'll start to see nonres improvement. Those correlations have been very well-documented in historical recessions. Our customers continue to be very optimistic. 63 of our respondents in Q3 expect growth in the next 12 months. So it continues to improve. And when you take a look and step away and look at the whole macro from the ARA metric, according to Global Insight, they're expecting an 8% growth in 2014 for our industry and a 10% growth in our -- in the rental industry in 2015. So you take that all together, coupled with the fact that Bill, myself and Matt, particularly, Matt spends a lot of time in the field, we were at the QBRs, the quarterly business reviews, very optimistic at the management level as well.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. That's really helpful, Mike. And just in terms of thinking about the fleet size, could you just give us some handholding on how you'd encourage us to think about what you'll do with the fleet in '14 to capitalize on that in terms of growth and where we should look for focus? I mean, there's no doubt you guys have incrementally tilted towards specialty, and it should be great to get your perspective on how we should think about CapEx next year and in the context of specialty rental.", "William B. Plummer", "Sure, Ted. I think it's fair to say, next year, we expect, with the improving level of demand in the overall macro environment, to spend a little bit more on fleet than we did this year, all right? So instead of $1.6 billion, we're thinking a touch more, a touch might be an extra $100 million, in the $1.7 billion area. And obviously, we'll flex if we see the demand ramp up significantly or ramp down significantly. But that's the framing thought right now. A significant portion of that level of spend or that incremental spend is being driven by growth in our specialty area. Trench, Power & HVAC are opening new branches, as we've talked, and really penetrating the market more effectively. So we want to support that without starving the rest of our gen rent business. And so that's the framing thought process. I don't know, Matt or Mike, if you guys want to add anything about where else we might emphasize the spend.", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Well, I would just reiterate, with the specialty business, the high return products, and not only that, but a unique product offering in our space, we've grown our specialty products at 3x the rate that we've grown our overall fleet. So that's -- we'll continue to see that trend throughout '14.", "Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And the last thing before I jump back in queue. But in terms of just cadence, if we were to go back and look at normal seasonality of CapEx patterns, should we at least be thinking that, that repeats or is there any unusual flows that we should be thinking about?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, I think a normal cadence of quarters is probably the way to think about it. As we planned, obviously, it'll depend on our planning process, which we're in the middle of as we speak. But I think if you look back historically, a more normal cadence is where you should start thinking about 2015.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "About funding the debt reduction and the share repo, just looking at some of your leverage targets. The fourth quarter cash flow, which is implied around $500 million, can you give us some feel for how you're thinking about debt reduction and free cash flow for repo in the fourth quarter?", "William B. Plummer", "Sure, David. So I will remind you that we gave a range for free cash flow of between $400 million and $500 million. And our view is that between payments against our accounts receivable and the timing of the remaining payables that we have against our CapEx purchases, that we expect a pretty robust fourth quarter of cash coming in. And we'll monitor that as we go through the quarter. We've been more effective at collections against our receivables over the course of the last year or so, and that puts us in a pretty good position to have a very robust payment stream coming in, in the fourth quarter to get us to that free cash flow number. We will -- obviously, as we think about executing the share repurchase throughout the fourth quarter, we will be very mindful of how the cash is flowing in, in the fourth quarter. And we'll meter the share repurchase activities that we do to make sure that it fits with our goal of coming in at about 3x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the year. If we're doing some share repurchases, obviously, that puts a little upward pressure on that. But if it's 3.1 or even 3.2, please don't call me a liar for saying about 3. That's the way we think, that will firmly keep us on the path of reducing leverage over the next several years and we'll continue to manage it with an outlook toward achieving that while we execute the repurchase and fund the overall needs of the business. Does that help?", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's helpful. I mean, obviously, we're trying to figure out, can you fund both? And what's the priority? And we're talking through 2014. And between -- you talked about leverage, you're talking total debt, right, not net debt, correct? So I'm clearly doing the math properly?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, that's the way we usually talk about it. I mean, there's not a lot of cash, so $120 million or so of cash relative to $7 billion of debt or so is not going to make a big difference. But yes, total debt is usually the way we think about it.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Because, I mean, the thing is, let's say, the EBITDA this year is a little below the midpoint, $2.275 billion, for example. To get that to the $3 billion leverage, that means you have to end the year with total debt, about $6.8 billion, $6.9 billion. You ended the third quarter nearly at $7.6 billion, right? And so to get this debt down to the appropriate level, to hit your target, it's going to imply all the free cash flow in the fourth quarter is going toward debt reduction. So I'm just trying to figure, is that the priority? Should I expect almost all the free cash flow in the fourth quarter is going to debt reduction then?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, I mean, again, we'll manage it with debt reduction currently in mind. And so I think that's a backhanded way of saying, \"Don't look for $100 million worth of share repurchase in the quarter.\" I think we'll manage the share repurchase to make sure that we stay on that path of leverage reduction.", "David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And then thinking about those targeted $2.5 billion leverage by the end of next year, what that can be implying about the EBITDA for next year. The cash flow for next year, you put out a target for 3 years cumulative of $1.5 billion, right? This year, you'd do $450 million, right? That means we have a little more than $1.15 billion the next 2 years. Let me just take the average of that. You say next year free cash flow is about $625 million, let me just keep it simple, $600 million. To fund the share repo next year, $500 million, it doesn't leave a lot for debt reduction next year. So I'm just trying to think, are you feeling that confident about the EBITDA number that you can pay off very little debt next year to fund the repo and still hit your target of $2.5 billion? Because if you did, it would imply an EBITDA next year of $2.65 billion, $2.7 billion, a pretty large number. I just want to make sure you're not -- that's what the math is telling us. I just want to make sure, what are you implying, that high EBITDA or that be careful on assuming we can do the repo at $500 million during the course of next year and still get the target to $2.5 billion on the leverage?", "William B. Plummer", "So without addressing the specific numbers, what I'd say is that we purposely chose the size and the timing of our share repurchase and purposely chose the statements that we make about the leverage so that we can make them all work together. So 18 months is the time that we said we would execute the share repurchase over, and that's not a statement that we do all $500 million during calendar 2014. And we'll continue to focus on managing and balancing how much we do of any of this so that we can continue to delever. That's an important priority for us, and we're going to manage with that objective firmly in mind. And we feel confident that we can do it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.", "Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Bill, I guess this is a good follow-up then. Perhaps if you can outline your thoughts around refinancing high coupon debt. What are you thinking in terms of timing strategy around that?", "William B. Plummer", "Sure, Manish. We monitor the higher coupon issues on almost a daily basis. Even if we didn't want to, we get phone calls almost on a daily basis. So we're always thinking about those issues. In particular, the 9.25 and the 10.25 are the issues that we do keep close tabs on. And right now, as we sit today, it's a challenge economically to say that it's appropriate to go, right? We don't have a call available under the terms of those notes today, right? The calls don't come into effect until later next year. And to take them out right now, you'd have to use the make whole or tender for them, and that's pretty expensive. So we're continuing to monitor. As time passes, as we get closer to the intrinsic calls in the issues, the premium to take them out comes down. And time is on our side in that regard. So timing, we'll certainly monitor it every day from now going forward. Realistically, you probably over the next couple of quarters before it really becomes economically attractive to do something. But we'll certainly let you know as we think more concretely about when we might do it.", "Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 2 operational questions maybe for Matt or Michael. I guess, firstly, maybe if you can give us a sense of how URI is performing versus the ARA operating metrics. Obviously, when you look at the performance for 3Q and this year, the performance is obviously quite strong. But I guess what I'm trying to gauge is where's the room for improvement? Is there a room for improvement?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Sure, Manish. It's Matt. I'm not sure which metrics you'd like to hear about. But just as we look at the business, we've got a lot of focus right now and will throughout 2014 about continuing to drive more productivity. We think the scale that we've built from the merger and now that we are very comfortable in branches that are anywhere from 30% to 50% more fleet than they had pre-merger, we think we've got some opportunities to reengineer. And whether it's cost out or just not as much cost in to support our growth, we think productivity is probably our single largest next lever of opportunity.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Yes, Manish, I would also add, just to give you a little color. You mentioned ARA Metrics and Rouse Analytics has a benchmark service that follows that and has a peer group that is pretty good-sized. We have in our presentation, we put in there, our dollar utilization as it relates to our industry peer group. We are -- we're the highest. We lead the industry within that peer group, which takes into account a lot of different things on dollar utilization. We also know that our rates are leading that industry peer group and have consistently done so for a period of time. But you asked where we can always improve. It comes to rate, it comes to mix, it comes to driving increased margin. And so I would tell you that we're never done. I think we have -- our best years are ahead of us, and we're going to focus intensely to achieve it.", "Manish A. Somaiya - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, you talked a lot about the specialty equipment and the growth prospects there. Maybe if you can outline size and scale of potential acquisition opportunities in these markets.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Well, the specialty sides of the business and the adjacencies, you're pointing to something that, really -- it's very fragmented, extremely fragmented. There's only -- in 1 area, there's only 1 large company in the Power, and that's something that we would be interested in. We were focusing on right now doing organic with some bolt-ons. We've got a good team. They're showing good growth. And we're going to continue to feed that opportunity. With regards to the other adjacencies that we have there, we're always opportunistic and inquisitive to what may be out there. But there's nothing that is of any magnitude. But there are some adjacencies that are attractive, and those all will be fully vetted to the same process that we've always looked at. And our model is always focusing around our strategic vision. Is it accretive? Will it enhance our returns? And then, culturally, how does it fit with the organization? So we'll always use that as a balance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "On the free cash flow, I know you guys, last year, on the third quarter call, were kind enough to provide a guide for free cash flow for next year. And, Bill, you've already mentioned the $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion for CapEx. I think the most recent thing we have is what David mentioned, the 625 [ph] in the Investor Day packet. Can you give us a little more color on what you are expecting for next year?", "William B. Plummer", "Why don't we get through our planning process for this year and give you more clarity on that in January, Scott? I mean, I certainly feel like it'll be a very robust free cash flow result. I really not like to put any new numbers on the table at this point. And so let's talk in January.", "Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, obviously, one of the things that's been a headwind is the fleet inflation. This is the time of year where you've set pricing with your suppliers. Obviously, you can combat the fleet inflation by increasing rental rates. But any commentary on how things are progressing with supplier pricing? Are you pushing particularly strong this year?", "William B. Plummer", "So I think what we would say is what we've said basically since I walked through the door here, at least. We're in discussions with suppliers about next year's purchases as we speak. We feel very good about our ability to keep our overall inflation in the low -- in the very low single digits on a year-over-year basis. There will be some impacts to final Tier 4 configurations of some cat classes. But when you blend that, the impact of price increases for final Tier 4 in with the overall purchases, we're still going to be in the low -- very low single digits.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Coppola from Thompson Research.", "Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Just following up on rate here. Understanding that 3.2% is still nice performance, is there any deceleration from what we've been seeing? So my question is, why are you able to drive more rate at this point? And what kind of environment are you facing competitively in terms of price? And what kind of pushback are you getting from customers?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Nick, it's Matt. So when you look at it on a year-over-year trend, we'll -- we continue to see sequential improvement that may not be as robust every month as it was last year. But we've seen sequential improvement throughout Q3. We expect to see sequential improvement up through December. December could be flat, but we don't need December to be sequentially improved to hit our 4%-plus target. And we're seeing most of the industry with a similar discipline around rate and understanding for all the reasons we need to, inflation of equipment costs and everything else that's involved in it. We're not really concerned that we're not going to continue to get rate improvement throughout next year. I think we referred to it earlier. We're going to go into next year with a 2% year-over-year improvement. Our year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter, we expect to be over what the year-over-year improvement was in the third quarter. And on top of that demand, we've got record time utilization for us, and as we sit here today, still a very robust time utilization. So we're very comfortable with the trajectory we're on to meet our commitments that we've made.", "William B. Plummer", "I'd also add that, as you look at the fourth quarter, the comparable is a little easier in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter. If you remember back last year, in the third quarter, the sequential months in the third quarter last year were very robust. July was 1.2%, August was 1.1% and September was flat. But that was a very robust third quarter. And so you're comparing to a pretty high base of pricing there. Those sequentials eased in the fourth quarter last year. And so if we can sustain the sequential momentum that we think, it'll show as an improvement in the year-over-year for the fourth quarter.", "Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group, LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on your unassigned accounts being up 10.5% year-over-year, certainly, very strong relative to the prior quarters, can you give us any color on what drivers were there? Is it really specifically going back after some of the folks that you left on the integration? Or is there really something there in terms of underlying demand between the smaller and the larger guys?", "Matthew J. Flannery", "I think it's a combination of both, Nick. It's certainly the fact that, as we had referred to earlier in the year, that we were going to put more sales reps back in the network to help accomplish that. So we've got 118 reps more today than we started the year with, and that's a net number and well on our way to our goal of 120 to 150 increase. I think the demand for these accounts is also higher. And I just think we needed to reconnect. And the combination of many outbound calling programs and a lot of activity around this, once we recognize that we lost touch with some local folks through the branch consolidations, we just made a very conscious effort, and I think that number reflects the benefits of that effort.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fisher from UBS.", "Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The margins on equipment sales were strong. And I think you said 62% are going to the branches, and that's up by 9%. Can you just give us a sense of where you see that 62% going and how quickly you might see that change over the next couple of years?", "William B. Plummer", "Steve, I'll take a shot at it. We don't have a specific target that we're trying to achieve. I guess you could say our target is 100%.", "Matthew J. Flannery", "Correct.", "William B. Plummer", "But I think at some point, it will slow down. I don't know that we're at the point yet where that share of retail will slow down significantly in the near term. I think we're getting better all the time at how we market used equipment. We're getting more sales collateral in the hands of our sales reps. We continually update how we present the equipment online, more pictures of the equipment. And we're running many more training actions to get sales reps focused on selling used equipment alongside rental. We're just now starting to ramp up a very focused effort on sales, export sales, for example, that should help keep that channel going. So it's hard to put numbers on it, but I think you can look for that mix to continue to shift positively. And that is going to be all good in terms of driving our margin performance. Anything you disagree with, Matt, or...", "Matthew J. Flannery", "No. I think Bill captures it well, and I just think it's another byproduct of the strong demand that we see from our customer base. With improved fleet growth, improved time utilization, improved year-over-year rates and improved used sales volume and margin, it is really in the retail channel, which is really our end users, I think, points to all the great indicators that we're seeing.", "Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And a quick follow-up. Time utilization, certainly, better than expected in the third quarter. Any particular expectations you want to call out for the fourth quarter kind of going to be up year-over-year? Is that what your expectation is?", "William B. Plummer", "It will be exactly what it needs to be to get to 68% for the year. How's that? No, it's -- we'll continue to see our year-over-year improvement in the -- in Q4. We haven't quantified it, but -- other than what's needed to get to the full year. But we feel pretty good about how time ute is developing here. So not quite another 100-basis-point improvement, but there'll be an improvement year-over-year in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for any closing comments.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today. You'll find our latest Investor Presentation on our website, and we've added a few slides to it. And as always, please reach out to us if you have something you want to discuss.

With me today, as the operator stated, is Bill Plummer, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Flannery, our Chief Operating Officers; and other members of our senior management team.", "Last night you saw as reported a strong end to a record year of value creation. Our efforts in 2013 were defined by our discipline, our focus and our pursuit of profitable returns. All three of these qualities are apparent in our results. Our rental revenue and our EBITDA both showed substantial year-over-year improvements in the quarter and these are the key metrics of our core business and their trajectories look very good. We increased our rental revenue by a robust 9.4% in the quarter. The full year increase was 7%. So we outpaced our performance in earlier periods as expected. And our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $651 million at a margin of 48.7%. That\u2019s 440 basis points higher than the prior year. These are strong tailwinds to take us into 2014. ", "In addition, the three drivers that underpin our revenue and margin showed solid year-over-year growth in a season challenging quarter. Our rates improved 4%. Our time utilization increased 60 basis points to over 69% and our volume of equipment on rent increased by more than 8%. The bottom line as you saw was an adjusted EPS of $1.59 per diluted share. Now Bill will discuss these numbers in more detail in a few minutes and then we\u2019ll go into the Q&A.", "So now I want to turn over to the current year. The operating environment is obviously a major factor in our outlook and we agree with the majority of forecasts, particularly more lively in rental market in 2014, with further upswings in 2015 and 2016. Now, whether the improvement this year is roughly 8% as global insight predicts, or a different number, our intention is to outpace the industry as we profitably grow the business. Now we\u2019ll continue to execute a balanced capital allocation program, incorporating investments both organic and inorganic growth. In the process, we expect to continue to bring down our leverage and return cash to shareholders.", "But the outlook we issued last night is a measure of our confidence in achieving these objectives. You can expect us to move well past the $5 billion mark in total revenue and with an even more dramatic improvement in EBITDA. To help drive this growth, we set our gross rental CapEx at $1.65 billion for 2014. That\u2019s a big number and we spent close to that last year and we think our customer activity will support it again. Now approximately 4500 million of this capital is earmarked for growth CapEx and based on our expectations for recovery, we can adjust the throttle of this anytime depending how the year unfolds. Our agility is a major advantage from other rentals in terms of fleet management and it ties directly to scale and liquidity.", "I also want to mention our used equipment margin because that\u2019s another measure of demand. Our fourth quarter margin on new sales was more than 46%, compared to roughly 40% prior year. Now, North America is a strong marketplace for us right now and we\u2019re in the process of expanding our export channels for used equipment to take advantage of foreign demand. So we\u2019re thinking both in near term and long term dynamics to execute our strategy for profitable growth. I want to reiterate our mantra that you\u2019ve heard me use before. United Rentals is not a company that chases topline at all costs. We view demand for our services and return on our capital as two sides of the same coin and we won\u2019t lose sight of that in the recovery. Our entire company is laser focused on returns. In fact, return on capital was a substantial theme in our annual management meeting three weeks ago. We\u2019ll be tracking returns very closely this year using metric that tied to compensation, both at the branch and executive levels. ", "Now I\u2019ll touch briefly on the operating environment for the fourth quarter as we carry into 2014. We drove rental revenue growth in all but one of our regions in the quarter, with about half of our regions showing double digit growth. The southeast had the most robust performance in our general rental business. It was up nearly 21% year-over-year. Georgia was particularly strong. We serviced large capital improvement projects and plant shutdowns as well as retail. A number of these projects are ongoing in 2014 and we see good demand from oil and gas, industrial manufacturing and the food and beverage sector. Plant maintenance and retrofits continue to be a strong trend.", "We\u2019ve also recently run bids for corporate offices and data centers. So it\u2019s an encouraging mix and the real traction in commercial construction is still ahead of us. Our specialty business has a growing role in this landscape. In the fourth quarter, trench safety revenues were up more than 19% year-over-year. The Power/HVAC revenues were up more than 15% and that growth would have been even higher without the comparison of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Our third specialty business is called Tools and Industrial Solutions and we see an enhanced opportunity to cross sell these services based on an increasing number of tool hubs in our footprint. As many of you know, these business units speak prominently in our company\u2019s growth strategy. We opened 18 specialty locations in 2013, 12 of them in the fourth quarter. These branches are off to a good start and we expect to realize a growing benefit from our specialty cold starts in 2014 and beyond.", "We\u2019ll continue our specialty offerings, both organically and through select acquisitions if the right opportunities arise. This year you can expect us to see open another 13 cold starts dedicated to Power and HVAC, Trench safety and pulls. We\u2019ve increased our capital allocation for specialty by 44% compared to last year. These are sound, strategic reasons for our focus on rentals, specialty rentals. First, they\u2019re an attractive high margin business that serves a range of growth markets. Second, we expect that a greater diversification of revenue streams in end markets will help us achieve our goal for return on invested capital and lessen the impact of cycles. And third, we can cross-sell these services to our General Rental customers using our existing sales structure. Cross selling for us is not just about incremental revenue. It\u2019s a big part of our positioning as a provider of total jobsite solutions. By cross selling specialty, we deliver more value to our key accounts. Large customers want and need these services and they\u2019re embracing the chance to access them through the one source, along with more traditional categories. ", "We also have good news report on safety. We ended the year with approximately 10% fewer reportables than the prior year. Our reportable rate for 2013 was 1.3, which is our best performance yet. Safety, like rental rate and cost discipline is an area where you\u2019ll never see us become complacent and there\u2019s always more work to be done. This mindset of continuous improvement has become embedded in our culture. We started with Operation United in 2009 for our call to the customer service excellence. It was extended to operations with our rollout of the 5S process in 2012. ", "And now we\u2019re embarking on Operation United 2 which is based on a lean philosophy pioneered by Toyota and this is tremendously exciting for the company. We\u2019ve completed 8 branch pilots using kaizen process and we\u2019re soon beginning a companywide rollout to target nearly 200 branches this year. Our vision for lean will require financial investment and a major operational commitment, but based on the results we saw from these pilots, we believe that we can realize significant improvements in our operations over time. We\u2019re targeting a run rate of at least $100 million in efficiencies within three years.", "So in conclusion, we had a record year in 2013, but we\u2019re still hungry. We\u2019re still thinking about new ways and we\u2019re also looking at our business from every angle, exploring every possibility for profitable growth. Most importantly, we\u2019re moving forward from an unparalleled position of strength. ", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Bill for the financial results and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So, over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As is usual I\u2019ll spend some time going in a little bit more detail on the quarter before I move on to our outlook for 2014. I\u2019ll start with just an update on rental revenue for the quarter. You heard Mike say that Rental Revenue was up 9.4% in the quarter. That was very robustly driven by the increase in our owned equipment rental revenue. OER was up 9.6% in the quarter. You heard about the 4% year-over-year rate improvement. That was a very significant driver, but we also had very robust volume growth in that OER number, up 8.2% in fleet on rent in OER for the quarter.", "Mix and other was a drag of about 2.6% and as we\u2019ve talked in the past, about 2% of that drag was from the effect of inflation on our original equipment as we sold used equipment. So the remaining negative 0.6% or so was owed to mix in our period mix and other mix effects in the revenue. So, OER up 9.6% or about $86 million out of the $97 million or so year-over-year growth in rental revenue.", "We also had another very strong quarter in ancillary revenue, up $15 million or so over the prior year. That\u2019s a 15% growth rate for ancillary, really driven by better sales of our rental protection program and higher collections on delivery revenue in the quarter. So a very robust quarter in ancillary and others. Re-rent was down in the quarter. That was the main difference between the two strong growth items in OER and ancillary. But put it all together, rent revenue was up to $97 million or so year-over-year and again that\u2019s a 9.4% rental revenue improvement.", "If you move on to used equipment just real quickly, another good quarter there for us, $134 million of proceeds of used at the 46.6% adjusted gross margin that Mike mentioned. So another very strong used result. The margin mainly reflects what was a very strong retail mix in our channels yet again. We were over 60%, actually about 51% through our retail channel in used sales in the quarter. That\u2019s up 1.8 percentage points versus the prior year and it reflects the continued emphasis that the field is putting on making sure that our used sales are really landing in the hands of the highest valued buyers for both us and for the buyer. So good used equipment sales quarter for us there again.", "Real briefly, touch on profitability. Maybe I\u2019ll do it as we\u2019ve come to do it recently by walking through a bridge of our adjusted EBITDA performance. So we were up $98 million in adjusted EBITDA, up to that $651 million number for Q4. Of that $98 million, we were helped by rental rate increases by about $35 million EBITDA impact. So that\u2019s the 4% year-over-year rate. Flow through is something like 95%. Volume was also strong, up $49 million over the prior year and again that reflects the 8.2% OEC-on-Rent growth that I talked about other flow through let\u2019s call it 65%. The fleet inflation and mix impact was a negative $16 million, again reflecting the fleet inflation from used sales, along with the mix impact as we talk about. Our used sales we sold $263 million of original cost fleet at an average age of 88 months. So if you hit that with the 2% inflation factor for each year in that 88 month period, that gets you to the fleet inflation dollars within that $16 million headwind.", "Synergies, had another good synergy quarter this year. $59 million of synergies realized in the quarter for Q4 and that\u2019s $17 million more in synergies than we realized in Q4 of 2012. So the year-over-year synergy impact on EBITDA was that $17 million difference. I talked about ancillary revenues being strong. So that contributed about $8 million in the quarter at EBITDA and our used sales contribution year-over-year was about positive $8 million as well. ", "SG&A. we had a good SG&A quarter. The impact in SG&A year-over-year was about $13 million positive, with a heavy contribution from a strong bad debt expense performance in the quarter. About $9 million of that $13 million was from bad debt expense reductions as we saw the benefit of all the good work we\u2019ve been doing to address the longer dated accounts receivable in our overall AR balance. The remainder are headwinds. We talked in the past about our merit increases on a year-over-year basis being about $5 million a quarter. So there\u2019s a $5 million headwind for merit. The other lines of business, new equipment, service and other and supplies accounted for about a $3 million drag year-over-year and a host of other things we lump into all other would be about an $8 million headwind. So those are the key components that add up to the $98 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. $651 million is a very nice 48.7% margin in the quarter and that\u2019s about 440 basis points better than the prior year. I think Mike said that as well.", "Flow through for the quarter in total was 110.1% and that was a very nice result, obviously helped along by the improvement in the synergies realized in the quarter over the prior year. If you exclude the synergies, still a very robust 91% in the quarter and that brought the full year for flow through excluding synergies to 59.4%. Again that\u2019s the full year. Just an aside on the synergies, we realized $236 million of synergies for the full year and we ended the year with an annualized run rate for cost synergies, these are cost synergies only, an annualized run rate of right at about that same number, right at about 238, 240. So we are very pleased with the synergy result that we\u2019ve realized and we feel that we have now completely delivered on the synergies, the cost synergies that we\u2019ve talked about since the RSC acquisition. So this will be the last quarter that you\u2019ll hear us talk about cost synergies as a separate standalone item. Those saves are now baked into our business and our objective is to drive them as we go forward. So a nice synergy result and a nice flow through result in the quarter overall as well. ", "Just touching briefly on EPS. EPS was $1.59 in the quarter and that totaled $4.91 for the full year at adjusted EPS. So a very strong year for us in earnings per share as well.", "Before I move on to the outlook, I\u2019ll just touch on free cash flow briefly. We ended the year, the full year with free cash flow of $421 million and that includes the add-back of about $38 million of merger and restructuring related payments. You all know that we\u2019ve been carving that out of the cash flow for the entire year, in fact since the RSC transaction. That free cash flow obviously is after the investment we made in our fleet. We spent $1.580 billion on new capital this year and obviously it nets out against the overall free cash flow that we delivered. So a very robust result in free cash flow from our perspective and well within the range that we had been guiding to afford the $500 million. ", "On cash structure and liquidity, just real briefly, we finished the year with total liquidity of about $1.370 billion. Within that was $1.1 billion of available capacity on our ABL and about $175 million of cash on hand. And I\u2019ll remind everyone that a couple of days ago we did redeem $200 million of 10.25% notes that we had assumed in the RSC transaction. So continuing to focus on really optimizing our capital structure. We used our ABL to redeem those notes and we were able to do that because we upsized the ABL during the month of December. But again even after using the ABL to redeem the notes, we still had that $1.1 billion I mentioned of available liquidity on the ABL by itself. So pretty good liquidity position for the company overall.", "So before we move on to Q&A, one last item to address which is the outlook for 2014. You saw it in the press release last night, but just to recap. We think our total revenue will come in the range of $5.25 billion to $5.45 billion in 2014. And within that, rental revenue will be driven by the key measures that we\u2019ve talked about. So we expect rental rates to be up about 4% for the full year and that will be after the impact of carryover. Caveat carryover this year will be something between 2% and 2.5%. So call it 2.25% just for discussion\u2019s sake. We do expect to improve time utilization this year. 68.5% is where we think we\u2019ll be. That\u2019s up 30 basis points over what was a very strong year last year and would be another record for us. So expect good operating performance to drive robust rental revenue growth. ", "And adjusted EBITDA, we\u2019re calling that between $2.45 billion and $2.55 billion and we will achieve that at a flow through of about 60% for the full year. So again another year of about 60% in 2014. Net rental CapEx, we\u2019re going to spend $1.650 billion on gross rental CapEx in the year and that will net down to about $1.150 billion in the year. Our free cash flow for the year we expect to come in between $400 million and $450 million over the course of the year and along with that, we think that we\u2019ll end the year with leverage as measured by net debt to EBIDTA somewhere in the 2.7 to 2.8 times area. That net debt will be after we\u2019ve executed a pretty robust share repurchase program this year. We expect to spend about $450 million on share repurchases during the course of 2014 and even with that, we expect our net debt to EBIDTA to come down to that 2.7 to 2.7 range from the 3.0 that we finished 2013 with.", "Let me address just one point that came up in some questions since the press release last night around free cash flow, the guidance of $400 million to $450 million. The questions or comments that we\u2019ve gotten suggest that hey, your EBITDA is going up. If you use the midpoint, your EBITDA is going up year-over-year something like $200 million, but your cash flow is basically flat. Why the disconnect? I assure you there is not disconnect. We think about these things very carefully as we put the guidance out. That increase of EBITDA of roughly $200 million in the year -- assuming it all came in cash would naturally argue for $200 million higher on free cash flow. The headwinds that we have working against that in 2014 now are an increase in our CapEx. We\u2019re $1.580 billion this year, going up to $1.650 billion. So that\u2019s an extra $70 million of capital spending. The $200 million is now down to $130 million. ", "We also are going to spend a little bit more on non-rental CapEx in the year as we roll out some of the cold starts and invest in the facilities to do that. We invest in pickup and delivery fleet those new cold starts as well as to improve the [P&D] fleet around the rest of the company. So another -- call it another 10 or so of incremental non-rental CapEx eats up part of that increased EBITDA. We\u2019ve got higher taxes coming in 2014 to the tune of about $30 million. No, we\u2019re not done with the NOLs in 2014. That increase is really reflecting some alternative minimum tax increases that we experienced, along with greater profitability in 2014 raising Canadian and state local taxes somewhat. So that $30 million gets eaten up in higher taxes. We get a little bit of a benefit in cash interest from having redeemed the high coupon issue, call that $10 million or so of benefit, but working against that is an increase in working capital as we grow our business. ", "Let\u2019s say we grow revenue roughly 8% and if we assume the same level of DSO performance, our accounts receivable will grow in that same area. We finished the year with roughly $800 million of AR. So you put 8% on AR, that\u2019s a $50 million headwind to working capital right off the bat. Working against -- offsetting that we are looking at some benefits with larger payables in the year. So you net all that together, working capital should be a headwind of something like $60 million. And then the rest is just puts and takes in a whole bunch of areas, including perhaps a little bit of conservatism on our part. So hopefully that addresses the free cash flow outlook that we gave and hopefully that gives folks confidence that it\u2019s fully in line with the other elements of guidance that we\u2019ve given for the full year. ", "A couple of real minor points just to finish up to help you with thinking about cash flow and some of the other items next year. Our book interest expense for the year we think will be in the $450 million to $500 million area. And cash interest for the year should be in the bottom part of that range. Our tax rate, we finished the year this year with an effective tax rate that\u2019s a little north of 36%. If you use 37% or so I think that would be a good starting point for our ETF in 2014. A little bit of pressure there from the mix of earnings between the U.S and Canada. Federal cash taxes, I mentioned that they\u2019ll be up roughly $30 million or so over where they were this year. We spent $48 million this year on cash taxes overall. So the increase is mainly federal for 2014. ", "So those are some key points on the outlook. Hopefully that helps you with your thinking about the year and certainly we\u2019ll be glad to address them in Q&A. but let me finish my comments by just reiterating what some of the comments that Mike made. We had a great year in 2013. It finished off strong and we have great momentum going into 2014. As we start the year this year, we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives that we think can really help contribute to a robust improvement in profitability this year as well as the years subsequent. So we\u2019re excited about the year and we look forward to talking to all of you about the results as we go through the year.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). It looks like our first question in queue will come from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "With the free cash guidance that you just underlined, Bill, the $400 million to $450 million for \u201914 on top of the $4.25 million for \u201913, can you talk about your relative comfort to reaching the $1.5 billon that you talked about collectively for 2013 to 2015 and what would be the source of that large uptick -- the implied uptick in 2015 which would have to be $600 million to $650 million?", "William Plummer", "Sure, Seth. Thanks for pointing that out. I probably should have said it in my prepared comments, but we\u2019re very comfortable with the $1.5 billion number that we talked about covering the \u201913 to \u201815 time period. Yes. It does imply a significant uptick in free cash flow for 2015, but again we feel good about being able to deliver that. Where is it going to come from? We think robust improvement in our operating cash flow from profitability. As we continue to grow the fleet and as we see the impacts of some of the investments that we\u2019ve made in prior years, we fully expect that we\u2019ll have a nice improvement in profitability that will contribute to significant improvement in free cash flow overall. So that\u2019s the biggest driver to get to that roughly $650 million number. There\u2019s a little bit of a headwind against that as we talk about NOLs run out in 2015. And so our cash tax bill will go higher. It will be a drag of something north of $100 million, $120 million thereabouts. ", "But we feel like with the improved profitability and some of the other items that I\u2019ll touch on in a second, we can overcome that. One of the other important drivers is that we don\u2019t anticipate to continue to grow our capital spend as we go forward dramatically. In fact as we sit here and think about 2015, we think broadly speaking we think about 2015 CapEx as being comfortable with the 2014 number that we\u2019ve seen. So we don\u2019t expect to see a significant drag from increased CapEx in the year 2015 as well. So that helps. And then we\u2019ve got some things focused that in the areas that I\u2019ll broadly call working capital that we think can really help improve our working capital position in \u201915 and contribute to lessen the working capital use in that year than what you might normally expect. ", "So those will detail more as we go forward. But if you broadly say working capital improvements, that will be a nice slug of the incremental cash flow in 2015 and then we\u2019ll get a little bit of benefit as well from the non-rental CapEx. I mentioned that we\u2019re investing a little bit more in non-rental CapEx this year. We should be able to dial that back in \u201915 as well. So those are the big things I\u2019d point to. There are a tonne of moving parts in that outlook, but we feel like we\u2019ve been pretty good in delivering what we\u2019ve said over the long haul and the short haul and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence that we can hit that roughly $1.5 billion number that we\u2019ve talked about. That help?", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. If I could ask a follow up on the CapEx discussion, did I hear correctly that specialty CapEx is up 40 something percent in2014? Multi core question, how should we think about CapEx cadence through the year? Should it be normal? And if specialty CapEx is up that much, where are you deemphasizing CapEx I guess?", "Matthew Flannery", "Seth, this is Matt. Good question. As far as the specialty CapEx, think of our CapEx as two thirds replacement and one third growth within that 50 number roughly. And if you think about the growth capital, the number that you\u2019re referring to, we\u2019re going to spend about 45% of that growth capital on specialty. It\u2019s a major strategic advantage for us with our key customers and as well as to fund all cold starts that Bill and Mike had referenced. Within the other two thirds of the capital, we will continue to mix even with major cap classes. So we have a focus on making sure there\u2019s three levers that we focus on, customer demand, first and foremost we have to meet their demand. But within those major cap classes of aerial, reach forks, and earthmoving, there\u2019s different mix we can get to meet the demand and at the same time improve our returns and that\u2019s what our team is focused on as far as CapEx spend for \u201914 and beyond.", "Seth Weber \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Should the cadence through the year be pretty traditional or do you think it will be more front end loaded or back end loaded this year relative to historical?", "Matthew Flannery", "We expect it to be similar to what we did in \u201913.", "Operator", "It looks like our next question in the phone queue will come from David Raso with ISI Group. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "I know it\u2019s a little bit of you can\u2019t please everybody, but trying to balance growth and hitting the cash flow and return on capital targets, when you speak to CapEx, best case flattish in \u201915, utilization this year you\u2019re looking at 68.5. How are we thinking about growth though in \u201915 with a flat CapEx? I\u2019m just trying to make sure yes clearly the re-rating stock giving away a little bit of growth is worthwhile for an improving return on capital and cash flow, but at the same time if I don\u2019t have CapEx growth in \u201915, structurally how are we thinking about where rates can go in that somewhat restrained CapEx environment. Where can utilization go? I\u2019m just trying to make sure we don\u2019t lean too far to the cash flow return on capital story and forget about leveraging the cycle bit.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, David. I guess I\u2019d point out that if we spend let\u2019s say $1.650 billion again in \u201915, we\u2019re still growing the fleet, right? That\u2019s still mid to upper single digits growth on the fleet overall and if you layer on top of that a little bit of improvement in utilization, that\u2019s a nice level of growth -- basis for growth even before you get any rental rate increases on top of it. So I guess I wouldn\u2019t despair of growth in 2015 with that level of capital spend and what we want to do is to make sure that we\u2019re leveraging the capital we already have plus any new capital that we spend as much as we can. And so we balanced it maybe a little more toward profitability improvement and return improvement than some would like, but I think it\u2019s going to really bear fruit as we go down the road in improving the returns and profitability of our business.", "Michael Kneeland", "David, I just want to add two other things to that that Bill highlighted on and I agree with what Bill said. These other avenues that -- we\u2019re taking off a lean process. We changed our processes to figure out how we can make sure that we can grow our revenues by expanding our time utilization and also getting our OEC not available down. So that to us is also another way in which we can get that trap cash and have it start working for us.", "David Raso \u2013 ISI Group Inc.", "And related to this, on page 52 the bridge to the higher returns speak to 6% growth in rental CapEx per year. So it is safe to assume trying to model out a few years there\u2019s going to be some growth in CapEx even if you flatten out in \u201915 to hit this 10.8% hurdle for return assume there\u2019s some pickup in CapEx if you look further out. And what are the EBIDTDA margins that are baked into this return analysis on page 52? Just so I can get a feel structurally where you think the incremental margins are from here to there, call it 2017. ", "William Plummer", "So I\u2019ll leave the exact margin numbers to your imagination, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that they continue to improve throughout the timeframe that we\u2019re talking about here. Yes, as you look further out we probably would add a little bit more growth CapEx beyond \u201915. I\u2019m talking a little bit more in CapEx assuming the market continues to move positively just to sustain a decent level of growth for the business overall. Incremental margins as we go forward, again as the modeling exercise right now I\u2019d say just keep using 60%, the number right around 60%. That\u2019s probably a fair way to think about incremental margins going out.", "Operator", "It looks like our next question in the phone queue will come from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Ross Gilardi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just I wanted to if you could elaborate, given your focus on returns in your comments on continued deleveraging and returning cash, should we assume that large acquisitions have moved lower on the priority list?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. I\u2019ve always said this, that there\u2019s a lot of opportunities and growth opportunities out there. We\u2019re in a position where we don\u2019t have to do anything to execute our strategy of going profitable. We always have a hurdle; I\u2019ll just say simple hurdles. We call it the three legged stool around here, the strategic fit. Financially does it make sense from the benefits we yield and a cultural fit. I would say that the bar has been raised and will remain high on those three hurdles and we\u2019ll have a very disciplined approach. We\u2019ve had opportunities and we passed on. So could it be something in the strategic or in the specialty side? I mentioned that we\u2019re looking at both organic and inorganic ways of growing that business. Could it? I don\u2019t know, but rest assured the bar is high and it has to hit those three hurdles.", "Ross Gilardi \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then just wondering if you could comment what you\u2019re seeing out of the major OEM dealerships with respect to rental. Clearly the rental channel is growing very fast. Your average OEM dealership amongst the majors is not seeing that level of growth right now. So are you seeing the OEMs respond aggressively by adding more to the rental fleet? Any color there would be helpful.", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure, Ross. This is Matt. We haven\u2019t seen a major expansion there maybe. Any growth at all would be significant because most of the OEMs don\u2019t have large rental fleets. I think their participation selling into the rental channel will continue and I think -- as I think about our top vendors, it\u2019s already a large part of their business and maybe some of the next tier vendors for us might get more into the rental channel. I don\u2019t anticipate dramatic changes in any of those results.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would also add that most of the OEMs he\u2019s talking about from a dealership standpoint would be earth moving and that is an area of our sector that we have grown. We\u2019ll continue to invest in, but the heavy side of it is something that we\u2019re not --- we have a big footprint on. So they may expand their rental portfolio, but it\u2019s probably going to be within their core competency. ", "Operator", "It looks like our next question in queue will come from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Congrats on a great quarter. Mike, could you just talk about your views on macro? I know you touched on it initially, but what is the most important metrics you guys are looking at internally, whether it\u2019s rate or time utilization to feel as good as you do? The customer survey is in the flavor they might provide on either growth by vertical so retail, lodging, office. Where do you see the best opportunity for you from an end market perspective and then regionally how are you feeling about it?", "Michael Kneeland", "I\u2019ll take the high level and the detail on retail I\u2019ll give over to Matt. So let me just say that within our investor presentation, I think it\u2019s page 12 we have our customer survey. This survey that we just performed in December comes at the strongest results that we\u2019ve ever seen. We only have 2% of the more than 228 customers we surveyed. Let\u2019s see, 2014 going down. 98% see 2014 going up or equal to 2013. So that\u2019s probably one of the strongest results that we\u2019ve seen since we started this survey process. From an external data, we do listen and we talk to and follow the global insight. We follow obviously the GDP. The ABI index I know there\u2019s some -- I guess some questions about the ABI. ", "The one thing I would just ask anyone to take a look at, if you go back to 2010, we had nine months that were negative and 2011 we had five months that were negative. In 2012 we had four months and then last year 2013 we only had three months. So you can see that trend continues to improve which goes back to our comments, you don\u2019t see this as being a hockey stick, but a gradual improvement and I think that\u2019s playing out. All indications are for all external resources that private non-res is starting to come back. Again we don\u2019t see it being a very -- a big uptick or a hockey stick, very gradual. So I\u2019ll shift over to Matt and let him talk from a regional perspective.", " Matthew Flannery", "Thanks Mike. Yes, Ted. So when you look at it from a region perspective, we had very broad based growth. 13 of our 14 geographic regions had year-over-year growth and half of those had double digit growth. If we wanted to round up a couple of cents of a point, we\u2019d actually add a couple of more regions into the double digit category. Eastern Canada remains -- we talked about it a little bit and the team up here is working hard, but they\u2019re not getting any macro tailwinds up there. So they\u2019re not in a growth mode, although their real results, their actual results are still very good results for the organization. We\u2019re seeing the hot spots where you would imagine. Oil and gas is a hot sector. Anywhere where there\u2019s power is hot and we\u2019re seeing our double digit growth in those segments. But when you look broadly overall and you look at the way we closed the fourth quarter on our key metrics of time utilization, rate improvement and used sales improvement in both margin and volume, specifically the retail portion of our volume which we really put an emphasis on and the demand is there. It really has us feeling very bullish on 2014 demand.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "That\u2019s great. And then the follow up if I may to tag along on David\u2019s question, if the market were to be up 8% hypothetically and URI outgrows it and that CapEx is up let\u2019s say 5.5% just looking at the simple numbers, would it be fair to infer that the time utilization improving 30 basis points may be conservative or is there something I\u2019m missing just in the high level math?", "William Plummer", "Ted, I always hesitate to say things are conservative, but that improvement that we\u2019ve talked about is not huge and particularly should be gauged on what the market is doing, but also on what we\u2019re doing inside the company. Lean initiatives that we\u2019re implementing could give us the opportunity to do better than that. I certainly wouldn\u2019t go lower than $0.03 improvement in 2014. If you\u2019re having a problem reconciling something, then -- and if increasing the year-over-year improvement in utilization helps you reconcile, then if I were in your shoes I\u2019d probably advice to bump it up.", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "And so if you roll that forward to David\u2019s question and you\u2019re in a flat CapEx environment in \u201915, can you talk about where you think you ultimately can get some utilization too over the next -- I guess whatever is embedded in page 52 in the return profile.", "William Plummer", "Sure. We can --", "Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Can we get to the low 70s? Is that -- could we be calibrated there or --?", "Michael Kneeland", "Ted, this is Mike. And I\u2019ve said this before both on the road and what not. In my 35, 36 years in the industry I would have told you that where we stood being around 70 would be probably a threshold. Having said that and gone through the kaizen event which I actually spent a week out on the road in Atlanta, it opened my eyes as it did the management that there is opportunities to exceed that. We are putting in investment to roll out 200 branches this year in our largest key areas to touch them to roll out our lean process. It\u2019s hard to quantify right here and now. We\u2019ll update as we go forward, but I would tell you that I can see areas where we can do over 70%. How far up between 70? I don\u2019t know right here and now, but I can tell you that it can go up. The headwind we would only have, as we grow the specialty side of the business, that\u2019s a business that time utilization is not really a big component to get those returns. But I can tell you that intentionally we\u2019ve got it baked in there\u2019s going to be higher time utilization opportunities. ", "Matthew Flannery", "Ted, just to add a little bit more; the improvement in utilization that we assume on the RIC Bridge Slide 52 obviously doesn\u2019t get you there. It doesn\u2019t get you to 70% if you just had 20 basis points a year over even five years. So we are putting in a number there for discussion purposes. To Mike\u2019s point, the opportunities will play out as they play out. We\u2019re optimistic on our ability to drive utilization. And so we certainly feel like there\u2019s an opportunity -- relative to Slide 52 there\u2019s an opportunity for us there.", "Operator", "Next question in queue comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Just on the rental rate growth going forward, how much do you think is tied to the extent of underlying non-residential construction market growth? Obliviously you grew just over 4% on flattish markets in 2013. I\u2019m curious how much is company specific rate initiatives versus underlying market growth. ", "William Plummer", "I would broadly characterize it as a mixture of both. We had carryover that was somewhere between 2% and 2.5% just coming in and certainly the market helped carry us up to the 4.2% that we realized for the full year. But we\u2019re very focused on making sure that we manage rental rate actively. So it\u2019s hard to separate it out and say half of it is from this and half of it is from that or 30%, 70%. That\u2019s a very difficult split to make, but I do think that both are contributing and both will continue to contribute as we go forward. And in fact if the market accelerates as many forecasts has it doing in \u201914 and \u201915, then you would think the share from market dynamics gets greater and we can continue to drive the specific rate management initiatives that we have and we hopefully can realize even better than the 4.2% that we got in \u201913.", "Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on sales of used equipment, is that more a pool where clients are coming in specifically looking to buy used equipment or a push where you\u2019re diverting people to used equipment? I\u2019m just curious wondering what your interpretation of increasing used equipment sales does to that market conditions.", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure Steven. This is Matt. It\u2019s definitely a focus for us pushing our reps to participate more in retail sales. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s converting people from rental to own. As a matter of fact every other metric that we measure in our business and with our existing customers tells you otherwise. I think folks were buying through other channels and we just needed to brand ourselves and position our self as a leader in used equipment opportunities for our customer base. So it\u2019s really just selling into our existing customer base who are also growing their rentals at the same time. As their demand picks up, it will continue to grow both the rental and the used equipment side.", "Steven Fisher \u2013 UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. It can coexist. That's great.", "Matthew Flannery", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next question in queue will come from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Nicole DeBlase \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just another question on rate, how should we think about 1Q rates given that I think you\u2019re facing a little bit of tougher comps. So should we expect lower rates in the first half of the year and acceleration into the back half of the year?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure Nicole. It\u2019s Matt. Actually when you look from a year-over-year perspective, you\u2019re not going to get -- we don\u2019t anticipate getting major swings within that 4% guidance. If we\u2019ve got upside then you\u2019ll see more swings in Qs 2 and 3 as our peak demand period let\u2019s say May through October is where our opportunity to get sequential improvement always lie. But from a year-over-year perspective, although there\u2019s a choppiness in comps, we\u2019re not forecasting or planning for anything more than 10 or 20 bps of variance quarter-to-quarter.", "Nicole DeBlase \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And then now that you\u2019ve moved past the period of negotiation on price with various suppliers, what are your expectations for fleet inflation next year, this year I guess?", "Michael Kneeland", "This year? It\u2019s somewhere between 1% and 2%. Call it 1.5% just for discussion\u2019s sake.", "Operator", "It looks like the next question in queue will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Congratulations guys on your year. Bill, you mentioned no longer discussing cost synergies from RSC. Could you address revenue synergies? That is something we haven't touched base on in a while.", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. Actually, Matt you want to try that?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure. We have -- once we\u2019ve got to our fourth quarter run rate, we feel very comfortable that we\u2019ve achieved our $50 million EBITDA goal. Remember that that\u2019s an EBITDA goal, not a rent revenue goal of our revenue synergies and that is net. The (inaudible) synergy that we had of almost $40 million early on during the integration from the store closures, it\u2019s mostly been driven by cross selling of our specialty products, in Trench, Power/HVAC as well as cross selling the total control solution service that we got with the RSC acquisition. So we feel comfortable that we\u2019ve achieved our revenue synergy. We\u2019ll build it into our plans. As a matter of fact it\u2019s built into our guidance going forward and we\u2019re excited that we reconnected with the local customer base. When you look inside, just to give a little color, when you look inside the customer base numbers, our unassigned accounts which was the area that we lost the local customers when we closed those stores, we put over 100 more sales reps on the streets to reconnect with those customers and when you look at our fourth quarter results, those customers grew at 12.6%. So we\u2019re encouraged that we recaptured those lost synergies. That was -- the leak in the bucket was really our largest concern and we\u2019re feeling good with that.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then following up on the prior question with regard to used sales, Bill or Mike, I think you mentioned expanding international distribution for used sales. Could you please elaborate on that? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. Right now that whole channel market is really a collection of various brokers and then it goes through the auction channel. We\u2019re establishing specific areas where we think that there\u2019s growth opportunity in foreign environments that would benefit. We\u2019ve made sales. We continue to make sales. We\u2019ve had used sales that go overseas and we\u2019re expanding on that by building new relationships in a much broader base. We want to make sure that it\u2019s an avenue or a channel. As we grow, we\u2019re going to be -- we are the largest producers of used equipment, quality used equipment and we think it\u2019s prudent for us to think through that growth down the pike and we are putting a capital investment and they\u2019re yielding benefits from the records already.", "William Plummer", "Just to add to that, we\u2019re hiring dedicated sales reps and focusing them on different regions around the globe. We know that there has been the demand for our equipment offshore. We\u2019ve just been reaching it through brokers and we think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to do a direct sale. We\u2019ve got a focused effort as Mike said and we expect that to continue to support our focus on driving used sales through our direct channels and realizing the benefit thereof.", "Operator", "Our next phone question will come from the line of Neil Frohnapplen with Longbow Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Neil Frohnapplen \u2013 Longbow Research", "Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. Did you guys re-price a lot of your national accounts that you only negotiate annually during the fourth quarter? And if so, were you able to increase rate more than in recent years that gives you guys confidence in the 4% price realization for the full-year?", "Matthew Flannery", "Neil, this is Matt. We don\u2019t want to speak specifically about any customer segment. I would say that broadly all of our customer sets are routinely under review. We did go through a major contract harmonization as you all know during the integration. That\u2019s 100% complete and now will just be part of our regular negotiation cycle with our contractual accounts specifically and they\u2019ll mostly be in the first quarter. It varies by customer and some of them are actually quite rigorous and long negotiations and contractually obligated or done through an RFQ system. but overall we don\u2019t see a lot of variability within customer sets and I think you\u2019ll see a similar result within all our customer sets that we had guided to that I answered when Nicole asked the question about seasonality. ", "Neil Frohnapplen \u2013 Longbow Research", "And then, Mike, just going back to your commentary on the ABI, it's declined the last two months and just wondering if you're seeing any slowdown in quoting or anything that gives you concern that the non-res recovery will be slower than expected this year?", "Michael Kneeland", "No. again as I outlined, the pattern from 2010 to 2013, we\u2019ve had less and less negativity. It goes back to I don\u2019t see this being a hockey stick. I see this as a gradual improvement. I think that we\u2019ll have to see how 2014 plays out. My sense is that we\u2019ll still have a positive outcome. Nothing\u2019s changed in my mind. I expect some volatility or some changes between month to month. If you go back, you had four months in 2012, consecutive months. But yet 2013 was a pretty good year for everybody. So again it continued to trend. Overall trend continues to improve and we had a diversified portfolio, about 50-50 industrial and then construction. So I think we\u2019re well positioned.", "Operator", "That does appear to be our time for questions so this will conclude our time for questions. I'd like to turn the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for any additional comments.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you, Operator. I just want to tell everybody that first and foremost, thank you for joining us today. I urge you to get the latest presentation on our investor website. It\u2019s been completely refreshed and a lot of new content. I think you\u2019ll find it most intriguing and helpful. We also launched our first national advertising campaign this week and customers will see a powerful message about our commitment to their success and you can watch the commercials on our website as well. If you have any additional questions or have any opportunities to visit any of our branches, please reach out to Fred Bratman. And as always, we look forward to the next quarter call.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded. Before we begin, note that the Company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The Company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. I want to thank all of you for joining on today's call. We have three topics on the agenda this morning; first, our strong performance in the quarter; second, our external environment and how that's playing out in terms of demand; and third, we'll give you an update on National Pump and some of the other initiatives that we have underway to drive growth and efficiencies. Our goal is also to provide you as much visibility as possible into how we are thinking about the rest of the year will unfold. And then after that, we'll answer your questions. So let's get started.", "The first quarter is always about pushing forward against seasonal headwinds and driving year-over-year improvement, and I'm happy to say that we overcame an unusually harsh winter and generated solid numbers in every major metric. We did this by managing the business very strategically to capitalize on pockets of demand, and we saw that in the results last night.", "We had a sizable increase in rental revenue and our adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin were both first quarter records for us. We also increased our volume, time utilization and rates on larger fleet, and something that wasn't in the release, we improved our rate sequentially for every month in the quarter. Frankly, that was a little better than we expected. Now Bill will discuss the numbers in a minute but that gives you an idea of how we've turned a seasonal low point into a strong start of the year. And now, I want to turn our attention to the marketplace at large.", "Last year, I said that we were bullish about the impending recovery. In January, we confirmed that equipment rental appears to be in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle. And now, commercial construction, which accounts for about half our business, appears to be in a broader recovery, and as you know, commercial construction is typically the last end market to pick up steam in an up-cycle. So any improvement is a positive sign.", "Even so, the first weeks of the year were very difficult, but as we moved through late February into March, things evened out and we're now seeing near universal improvement in demand. And that's not just a 10,000 foot view. A few weeks ago, we completed our quarterly business reviews, so we have very recent input from the front lines. Reports from the field indicate more optimism than we've seen in years, and our customers are upbeat about their own business prospects. So in short, there is a widespread sense that things are back on track.", "The first quarter metrics support this. For one thing, our used equipment margin was more than 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter last year, and that's another good indicator in market optimism. All but one of our regions showed rental revenue growth in the quarter and about half our regions had double-digit growth. I'll give you an idea of the scope of recovery. Our Midwest and Southeast regions turned in the strongest revenue performance. They had year-over-year increases in the range of 18% to 19%. And our Gulf, Mountain West and South regions were very close to the top. In the Southeast alone, we won bids on the City Center complex, a power plant, a pharmaceutical plant as well as two other sports facilities and a large residential tower.", "We're also seeing infrastructure projects come back online both in the U.S. and Canada, and our industrial business continues to be robust, particularly with manufacturing and energy. And this kind of project diversity we expect recovery begins to take root, and we've been steadily scaling up to meet this demand, and now in the second quarter we're in an ideal position to take some significant steps forward.", "First, there's our capital allocation. We plan to deploy over 40% of our gross rental CapEx in the second quarter and we'll purchase roughly $750 million of fleet against our full-year guidance of $1.7 billion. And as we noted in January, we increased our capital allocation for the specialty rentals this year with an eye towards growing these businesses. Our full-year CapEx plan for specialty fleet is approximately $240 million, and this includes capital for National Pump which we closed on April 1.", "Now on the subject of National Pump, this is a new platform that has all the hallmarks of a home run. It's really put in the place as a key part of our equipment range, and the integration is doing well. We have rebranded the business as United Rentals Pump Solutions, in line with the way we market our other specialty offerings. The plan is to move the pump operation onto our technology by the end of June, and then launch a fully integrated cross-selling effort.", "Our other specialty lines continue to turn in strong performances. Same-store growth for trench safety, power and HVAC was an impressive 19% year-over-year, and we're on track to open at least 18 branches this year including some for our new pump platform and our industrial tool business.", "As we previously stated, we want to double the size of our high-margin specialty segment within five years. That gives you an idea of the importance we placed on these businesses as a lever of ROIC. Although they are unique in certain ways, our specialty operations share the same culture and sense of purpose as the rest of our organization. For example, every branch regardless of its focus understands that safety is our first priority, and in the first quarter, we worked together to drive our recordable rate below one, for the first time in our history. That's really a major victory.", "Now I want to call attention to our lean initiative that we announced on our last call. Lean requires upfront investment of time and money, but we think it can generate a run rate of at least $100 million of efficiencies within three years. We have already introduced the lean process to over 100 of our branches, and while still early, we've identified what should be sustainable improvements in productivity, and we'll be able to share more about this program with you later in the year.", "And finally, our entire sales force is out there talking to our customers about the benefits of sourcing their job site needs to a single provider. This gives continual cross-selling opportunities throughout the project lifecycle. It also encourages more revenue from our key accounts which were up almost 8% in the quarter versus last year, and it encourages our local unassigned accounts to stay with us and grow over time. Unassigned accounts, roughly a third of our revenue base, they were up almost 12% in the quarter. So we have a lot of momentum in a very promising year.", "Now before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to share a personal observation. I believe that one of our greatest strengths as any organization is our ability to manage all the initiatives I just described, and still think about the business very strategically. We're a disciplined, thoughtful, inventive company that stays both focused and open-minded about our avenues of growth, and these qualities have given us a strong start to the year and we'll continue to make sound decisions that earn us investor confidence.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for the financial results, and after that, we'll take your questions. So, over to you, Bill.", "William B. Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and I'll offer my good morning to everyone as well. I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that were in the press release last night and hopefully it would be helpful. If not, ask questions in Q&A. Starting with revenue and in particular rental revenue, a nice quarter for us in rental revenue growth. It was up 9.7% over last year. It's about $89 million of higher rental revenue, and that rental revenue growth was really driven by all components.", "Within that, our owned equipment rental revenues were up 9.1%, our re-rent was up 7.8%, and our ancillary and other items were up a robust 16% over last year. So, a very nice growth in all the components of rental revenue. Within the owned equipment revenue line, OER, Mike mentioned rental rate performance was good. We were up 4.3% on our rate metric for the quarter, very nice start to the year for us.", "The volume was also very strong in the quarter. We had an average of just under $5 billion of fleet on rent. That's up 7.6% compared to last year. So, a nice volume quarter for us as well. And to get those two lining up nicely in spite of the harsh winter that Mike mentioned and also in spite of what was a headwind from the Canadian exchange rate which was down about almost 9% year-over-year, it was a nice start for us.", "So, those were two nice drivers. Obviously inflation and mix were a headwind, call it 2.8% headwind, on the year-over-year growth for those two components combined. So, all in all, a very nice start to the year on a rental revenue basis and carries us nicely into the start of the second quarter.", "Fleet overall was up this year. We spent roughly $330 million on fleet purchases for the quarter and so our average total fleet size was up 7%. So you combine that with the 7.6% growth in fleet on rent and that gets you the 40 basis point improvement in time utilization that we reported last night. So, again, another nice start on time utilization improvement for the year.", "Before I leave revenue overall, just to hit used equipment sales quickly. We generated $110 million of used equipment proceeds during the quarter, and very importantly, we did it at a very robust margin of 49.4% adjusted gross margin. We think that reflects a very, very strong demand environment which despite the harsh winter started to build momentum later in the quarter. It was down from the prior year and that 11% decline we think was heavily impacted by winter weather.", "We also think it was heavily impacted by the expiration of depreciation incentives in the tax code at the end of last year. We think some people accelerated their used purchases into the fourth quarter and borrowed it out of January and February of this year. But we are encouraged by the fact that March used sales activity was very nicely rebounded and so far April feels pretty good as well. So we feel we're well on track to deliver our used sales expectations for the full year.", "Let me turn to profitability, starting at adjusted EBITDA, $519 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and delivered at a 44.1% margin, which is a record first quarter margin for the Company. So, a very nice improvement in adjusted EBITDA, $68 million year-over-year improved, and importantly, 310 basis points of improvement from last year.", "Just to walk you through the bridge components of the year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA, we calculate the rental rate impact at $33 million of that $68 million improvement, volume about 7.6% growth in fleet on rent translates into $41 million of the $68 million year-over-year improvement. Fleet inflation and mix was a headwind, a net of $16 million. The robust ancillary and other rental revenue growth that I referred to earlier translates into about $8 million of year-over-year improvement.", "We had a good bad debt expense experience for the quarter. Year-over-year bad debt was favorable $4 million compared to last year, so that contributed nicely. We had our normal merit increase process. It cost us about $5 million of headwind in the quarter. And then the net of everything else we lump into other, including much of the FX impact, and all of that was a net $3 million improvement over last year. So, those are the components, and certainly if you have further questions about them, we could address them in Q&A.", "Flow-through in the quarter was very robust for us, 87.2% for the quarter, and that reflects not only the underlying performance of the business but a couple of specific items that we'd call your attention to. You remember last year in the first quarter we had some one-off items that we called your attention to back then. It was $5 million to implement 5S across our branches. There was another $5 million that we spent to reduce the amount of fleet not available. So, those were one-offs, they did not recur this year, and so that $10 million year-over-year impact helped to boost our overall flow-through. We also had the bad debt experience that I talked about. It was $4 million of year-over-year improvement. So, that helped boost the flow-through effect as well.", "And the last thing we'd point to is that we did have a decline year-over-year in used equipment sales. And so, we had a reduction in revenue dollars that took away roughly 49% margin dollars. So, that reduction in a lower margin item actually helped boost the remaining overall flow-through. So, we wouldn't extrapolate the 87% flow-through for the remainder of the year. We continue to believe that we'll deliver about 60% flow-through for the full-year as a total company, and I'll point out that that includes the impact of adding National Pump which adds revenue dollars at about a 50% margin. So that's going to weigh us down, but we still think that we'll deliver about 60% flow-through for the full year.", "Dropping down to EPS real briefly, $0.90 of adjusted EPS for the quarter. That compares to $0.48 in the first quarter of last year. Obviously, a robust performance and it really just reflects everything that I talked about previously.", "Before I go to the outlook, just real quickly on free cash flow and the capital structure. It was a busy quarter for us. Free cash flow came in very strong in the first quarter, $278 million, and that's of course after the $330 million or so we spent on rental CapEx and another $18 million or so on non-rental CapEx. So, a robust start to year on free cash flow and it puts us nicely on track for the free cash flow that we guided to for the full-year.", "We had some capital structure actions during the quarter as well. We had previously announced the redemption of $200 million worth of our 10.25% notes. We made that announcement in the fourth quarter. We actually closed that redemption in the month of January and funded it from our ABL. So that transaction closed early in the quarter. And then later in the quarter we issued new notes, both to refinance another high coupon issue, the $500 million of 9.25% notes. We issued new notes there by reopening another existing issue, our 6.125% notes. And then we also issued $850 million of new notes to finance the acquisition of National Pump. And I call your attention to the fact that all of those issues happened during the month of March, the actual payments though didn't happen until the month of April. So, they actually don't show up as outflows on the balance sheet at March 31.", "If you look at where we stand today, actually as of April 14, so earlier this week, on liquidity, the net of all those actions have happened and so our liquidity overall is a total of $1.35 billion. That includes available ABL capacity of $1.2 billion and net cash position of $132 million.", "Just briefly to touch on the share repurchase program, we executed about $43 million of repurchases in our common stock during the first quarter. If you add that $43 million to what we did in the fourth quarter and what we've done in the month of April so far, we stand at about $90 million of shares that we repurchased against the $500 million authorization that we had. Obviously, we've said before that we expect to repurchase about $450 million of shares during calendar 2014, and we feel like we've gotten a decent start during the first quarter, but perhaps a little slower than otherwise it would be because so much of the first quarter was blacked out either for reporting purposes or because we were working on the National Pump deal.", "So, you can expect us to ramp up that repurchase activity in the second quarter and we still are very committed to delivering $450 million of those repurchases in calendar 2014, and indeed getting the entire $500 million authorization done by April as we originally \u2013 April of next year as we originally announced.", "Just to hit on our outlook real briefly, you saw that we didn't change any of the numbers to our outlook for 2014 last night but perhaps a slight change in tone. So just to reiterate, we expect total revenue in the range of $5.45 billion up to $5.46 billion during calendar 2014. Within that, rental revenue growth will be driven by our expectations around rental rates. We still see rental rates up about 4% for the year. Obviously, we did get off to a nice start. So, we hope that we will have an opportunity to do better and always will try to do better.", "Our time utilization for the full year, we continue to expect to be up 30 basis points compared to last year, and I'd remind everyone that that would be another Company record. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect the full year to come in between $2.55 billion and $2.65 billion, and as I said before, we expect the flow-through to adjusted EBITDA to be about 60% for the full year. Our view of adjusted EBITDA is that we're not in a position where we think it's prudent to raise the range of expectation, but we have started to say that we expect to be near the top of that range, and so we'll continue to drive higher there if we have the opportunity.", "The CapEx picture is unchanged as well, $1.7 billion of growth CapEx for the full year is our expectation, and that will net down to $1.2 billion on a net basis. And finally on free cash flow, we continue to expect between $425 million and $475 million of free cash flow for the year. And I'll remind you that all of those outlook components reflect the addition of the performance that we will realize from National Pump.", "I'll stop there and open it up for Q&A, but certainly do feel good about what we did to start this year and we look forward to rolling out the rest of the year hopefully into a very strong year for us overall. So with that, operator, let's open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "I just wanted to go back to, in your prepared remarks you talked about this $100 million of cost initiatives. Can you talk about how much of that is embedded in your guidance for this year, it sounds like not a lot, and sort of how should we be thinking about that rolling through the model over the next couple of years and kind of helping the pull-through margin, is my first question?", "William B. Plummer", "Seth, it's Bill. We haven't given a number for 2014. What we said is that we'll make a nice down payment on that $100 million run rate impact. We certainly think that anybody who saw the number would agree that it would be a nice down payment, but that's as far as we've gone.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "And do you think it should have been linear or you think it's more backend weighted?", "William B. Plummer", "You know, we're just starting to roll out the program, so logically it has to be more backend weighted. But I think we expect that it will build nice momentum as we get into the second half. I'd remind you also that it is built into the guidance that we've given, right. The assumption that we have for how much, we did put in. So it's not something that we are keeping in our back pocket, it's out there in the guidance.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Right, but if it's accelerating going forward, could that in theory support a pull-through margin north of 60% next year, say in 2015?", "William B. Plummer", "I'm not ready to say that just yet, Seth. I think what we need to do is to make sure that we've got a handle on all the components that will impact pull-through next year. We certainly over the longer haul think that 60% is a good way to think about things. This could be a way to get higher flow-through, but it's maybe what we need to do in order to get to the 60% consistently. So, let us reserve comment on 2015's pull-through until we get a little closer.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "This is Mike. There is a level of transparency that we have with everybody in, and as I mentioned in my opening comments that as we go through the year, we'll be able to communicate more. There are several factors, it's not just the cost initiative, it's also our revenue initiative as well. So we want to be able to quantify and be able to speak clearly to everybody. So, expect to hear more as we go through the year.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you. And then, Mike, if I could just follow up on National Pump, I know we're only a short time into the transaction but can you characterize any conversations you've had with customers about cross-selling between the two, any opportunities that have come up in the short time that you've owned the company?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I will say that I did spend a day out at one of the branch right after we closed and I walked away very excited about the opportunities there ahead of us and also the management that we have brought on board, but I'll ask Matt to speak specifically to your question.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thanks, Mike. Hi, Seth. So, we obviously were very excited about the deal before we closed or we wouldn't have made that investment, but we've been even more pleasantly surprised by the reaction from our employees and our customer base. We've had strategy meeting over the last few days where Paul McDonnell and his team leading the specialty business and our national accounts team have been strategizing on cross-sell because the customers are pulling us in immediately. So, once we're all on the same platform, which will happen by the end of the second quarter, that will be even easier to do but we already are working on plans on cross-selling. Our customer base has really received very positively us filling this gap in our product offering.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you very much, guys.", "William B. Plummer", "Before we go to the next question, I just wanted to correct one thing I said on our outlook for the full year. The total revenue range will be $5.45 billion at the bottom, $5.65 billion at the top. I think I misstated that previously. I just wanted to get it straight. So, operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs", "Can you gentlemen just talk about the action that you took to manage the fleet in the quarter? You alluded to it in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you could flush that out because you outperformed the typical seasonality from a utilization standpoint, 1Q versus 4Q, in what should have been a really challenging quarter, and then if you apply typical seasonality from here, I guess you'd get well above your utilization target for the year. So I'm just wondering if you could just step us through what went right in the quarter.", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure, Jerry. It's Matt. Obviously, we really were focused on not putting any undue pressure on the areas that we're having a bad weather impact, and re-shifting fleet, both new fleet and existing fleet, to the markets where we had opportunities. With that being said, the Midwest had quite a harsh winter and was one of our highest growing region at 18% growth. So there is some of this that's just penetration and the continued growth of the build we've been doing since the integration of RSC. But I would say from a macro perspective broad-based, it was how we managed our opportunities and make sure we funded our opportunities, and the rate impact came as a result of us not putting undue stress on the impacted markets. So, we're very happy with the way the team managed that.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs", "And given that, Bill, at which point did you start thinking about taking up your CapEx outlook for the year in the context of how strong the start has been from a utilization standpoint or which utilization level on a full-year basis would you say we probably have enough fleet on hand?", "William B. Plummer", "There's not a magic number on utilization where we would say, it's time to spend some more. I think it's fair to say that we have an ongoing conversation about how much we spend daily, and the question is, what's the set of circumstances that get us comfortable enough to say, yes, we'll put more fleet into the business. I think it's also fair to say that we probably want to have a good look at how the season is building, and that means that you want to see April, you probably want to see May before you start having any serious conversation about possibly raising CapEx. So, stay tuned. I think we'll talk more about it in the second quarter earnings call and have a tighter view at that point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.", "Steven M. Fisher - UBS", "As you've been exhibiting a greater level of discipline on CapEx, as you were just talking about, but I'm curious what kind of discipline, or if relevant lack of thereof, are you seeing in the marketplace from competitors both large and small?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I'll talk about the high-level. First and foremost, I think when you look at all the companies that report publicly, they are all very prudent in the way in which they are approaching the markets. They have different strategies but they are putting in the appropriate capital for their strategy, but [indiscernible] you're seeing rental rates improvement. We also subscribe to [a route] (ph), we've mentioned this before, there's about 84, 85 good companies that report as you look in the rear-view mirror for legal reasons, about a 90 day lag on it, and it gives you a sense of different [MSAs] (ph).", "When we look at how we're raising our rental rates over time, we're seeing kind of the whole industry come up. So that would tell you that everyone is appropriately trying to apply rental rates wherever they can. So that's the best market data I have. Matt?", "Matthew Flannery", "I think Mike covered it well, and I do think more importantly the OEMs are \u2013 I think that the combination of the OEM participation and the credit markets are making people to be more responsible than maybe they did going all the way in through 2008 and spending money and OEMs producing a lot of products. So, I think the growth is smooth, steady and appropriate for the level of demand that's out there.", "Steven M. Fisher - UBS", "That's helpful. And then maybe just a question about the agility of your business model. You made a decision to focus on rates as you talked about [to enable to] (ph) make adjustments for weather in the quarter. Just curious, at what point in the quarter did you make those adjustments and set that strategy, and I guess the broad question is, how quickly can your ship be turned to address market conditions, and then how would you say, how would you describe what your focus is for the second quarter?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "I would tell you that when you look at our fleet management process, there's an evolution of the best of both worlds when we went through the RSC transaction. We took some of their operating principles, we took some of our operating principles, we bonded them together and we developed a very disciplined approach in the way in which we are going to apply it, and this is the end result. So, I think that as Matt mentioned, we have the ability to fund pockets where they were needed. Conversely, we didn't put undue pressure in areas where it wasn't required, and I think that will be an ongoing process.", "As far as our agility to move, it's very difficult to move things from say Canada down to say Florida, but you can sell and you can repurpose that capital. Those are the things that we do and all of these things are how we manage the fleet on a go forward basis. And by the way, it's not just a snapshot of where we are today, we have to think about it, where are we going to be six months to a year down the road because we don't want to be moving this capital on a continuous basis in that format.", "Matthew Flannery", "I think the additional good news is that we have broad-based demand now. We got through the winter by maybe being a little more selective about our opportunities, but as a Mike stated in his prepared remarks, we have growth in every region except for one geographically and half of them are double-digit growth. So I don't think we'll be as challenged with where we meet the demand from a rate perspective, it will be which ones we choose to fund at a higher level than others.", "Steven M. Fisher - UBS", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "What I would like to tackle is your sales force. You added I think 100 folks mostly unassigned accounts last year. Want to get an update on productivity there and then your plans for 2014 and which areas are you adding, the number and productivity and areas of focus.", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure, Scott, this is Matt. We actually have 153 more field sales reps on a year-over-year basis. So we had 100 for our goal for the second quarter last year but we built that up to 150 throughout the year, and that's where we sit today. We think that's appropriate level for OSRs other than additional reps we may bring in for our 18 cold starts, and you'll see some more there. So, we feel pretty good about the level of our sales team and we've got very good productivity out of them. As you see, our unassigned accounts grew faster than the overall Company growth in the back half of the year and for the first quarter this year, and that was really us reconnecting with some of the business we felt we lost during the RSC integration.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks. And then I have a follow-up. I noticed from the presentation pack this time around, you're focusing on the specialty rental categories that you have. Historically you've also \u2013 you've been focusing on those that you were targeting and [I was just wondering] (ph) now you've achieved it. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking, is it going to be time spent on integrating or are you looking still actively perhaps at M&A and some of the other categories, liquid storage tank rental or others that you had listed previously?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "This is Mike. I would tell you that we are clearly focused on integrating the pump business and we've dedicated ourselves to growing our specialty business and we want to grow it, double the size of the business over the next five years. That is our main strategy. With regards to looking at other possibilities, I think it's prudent for us to always look at what the future may bring us and that is a big laundry list. So again, going back to the discipline that we've talked about numerous times, we look at a strategy, we look at the returns and then we also look at the culture, and all of those will always play into our decision-making, but right now we're focused on integrating the pump business and we see a significant upside opportunity for us to \u2013 like I said, it's got the hallmarks of a home run and that's what we're focused on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Philip Volpicelli from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank", "With the goal of doubling the specialty business, how much of that is going to come from acquisition and how much of that would come from just organic growth and capital spending?", "William B. Plummer", "It's Bill, Phil. Most of it is going to be organic growth. That's the way we're targeting the initiatives for the business. So if there is an acquisition, we'll re-evaluate whether we should raise that target, change that target to add on the acquired growth on top of the organic growth.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, as the last question, you answered the question on the liquid storage tank, obviously with National Pump you get into more of the oil and gas, is that an area of focus that you'll either spend CapEx or look to make an acquisition to kind of broaden out that pump portfolio?", "William B. Plummer", "So oil and gas is an area of focus just as an industry vertical for the business overall. I don't know that I'd say it's particularly a focus for acquisition as much as a focus for how do we build relationships with customers and how do we make sure that we can offer value to them. If an acquisition makes sense, right, then we certainly will look at it but it's got to hit our criteria and we're not going to do it just because we want to plan a bigger flag in the oil and gas sector. But Matt, Mike, if you want to add anything to that?", "Matthew Flannery", "No, I think Bill covered it well.", "Philip Volpicelli - Deutsche Bank", "Great, and just the last one for me. I think, Bill, on the last call you mentioned 2.7 to 2.8 net leverage by the end of the year. Is that still part of the guidance?", "William B. Plummer", "Yes, I mean that's still in the neighborhood. It might be a touch higher. We put in the investor deck a slide that shows 2.9 at the end of this year. I think as we've gone through some of the refinance actions, as we've gone through finalizing the Pump acquisition and just looking at how the cash flow will play out over the year, it may be just a touch higher but it's still in that neighborhood.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray", "Just wanted to get some color on your capital allocation strategy. You're generating attractive free cash flows of north of $450 million per year. Once you complete your delevering plan of 2.9 by the end of this year and your share purchase of $500 million by April of 2015, what's your priority for use of excess cash beyond that?", "William B. Plummer", "I'm sorry, George, can you ask that question again?", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray", "So just want to understand what your priority for capital allocation is once you completed your delevering plans and share purchases to the targets that you have already issued?", "William B. Plummer", "Once we complete our delevering plan, that's interesting. I'd say we still believe in the leverage range that we talked about, 2.5x to 3.5x. If we get down to the 2.5x level and have completed the share repurchase program at that point and we don't have an acquisition that hits all of our criteria, then I think it's legitimate that we would talk about whether further share repurchase makes sense. That's certainly not something that we're afraid of. But we got to get through that priority of cash flow use that I just walked through.", "And we've put a slide in our investor deck just trying to highlight the priority of thinking around cash flow allocation that very much reflects that order, right. First, you got to fund the organic growth of the business, but yes, that's before free cash flow. And then, once you have that free cash flow, we want to make sure that if there are acquisitions out there that make sense, that we will take a hard look at them, but if they are not lined up, share repurchase makes a lot of sense. That helps?", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, very helpful, thank you.", "William B. Plummer", "Let me go back to Phil's question just real quickly. The 2.7, 2.8 leverage ratio was before Pump. So when you include the acquisition of National Pump, the 2.9 is our view currently of where we'll end the year, just to clarify that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "Quick question on the guidance what's implied. It sounds like you're pretty focused on pushing rate and the rate started the year above the full-year guide. It appears April is off to where you run \u2013 you're running even higher above the guide on rate, and obviously your rate is pretty powerful on drop-through for incremental EBITDA margin. So just so I'm clear, the rest of the year, let's say the high end of the range for EBITDA and that means 2.625, just for argument sake, it implies the rest of the year incremental EBITDA margin base of only 50. If you want to pull out National Pump, 51. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand, is the focus still on pushing rates, because if it is, the 51 would be one of your lower incrementals in a while, so I'm just trying to understand is there something implied in that incremental margin that there is a little more of a utilization push versus rate, I'm just trying to understand what does it imply?", "William B. Plummer", "So we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the incrementals by quarter or by half. And so, it's not something that I'm as faceted with the numbers as maybe you are, David. I think as we do think about the full-year, we think that we want to make sure that the 60% or so flow-through that we've been talking about is a high probability, we believe that it is, and there are some things that in the second half may represent a little bit more of a challenge than we saw in the first quarter of the year.", "So for example, we're going to ramp up our used sales activity. As we add more used sales in the back two quarters of the year, we're going to be adding revenue dollars at something like 50% EBITDA dollars. That will weigh out us a little bit more than it did in that first quarter. I don't see anything in particular that's a concern for the remaining part of the year, but I do think that we want to be a little cautious in terms of how we guide you to think about flow-through.", "One other thing I'd point to as well is that bad debt expense, it was a very nice experience in the first quarter, $4 million benefit year-over-year. As we think about the full-year, we don't expect to see that kind of a benefit in every quarter this year. We're doing a lot of good work around bad debt to reduce the amount of aged receivables but as we sit here today we're not forecasting that benefit to continue at the level that it started out the year.", "So, it's things like that that as we think through the remainder of the year in more detail, we say let's just make sure that we've got a handle on it before we get too aggressive in where we're going to end up for the full year.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "I appreciate that, Bill, but even if you pull out the $4 million benefit from bad debt, the incremental goes from 87 for the quarter to 82. I mean obviously it wasn't that big a number. So again, I'm just trying, bigger picture, trying to understand, are you implying something or is it, it is what it is and we can model as we choose, but I'm just trying to understand, is there a shift in what you're focusing on or would you argue, no, it's still a little more rate than it is utilization as your focus the rest of the year?", "William B. Plummer", "I think it's fair to say that we think about it more of it is what it is. We certainly are going to push rate. We think that we've got an opportunity. Whether we'd actually be able to execute and get better than the above 4% rate that we are talking about, we'll see how it plays out as the year goes on. Let me go back to the first quarter flow-through, that 87% was really aided by a few things, and if you take out the bad debt, if you take out the impact of those one-offs that we had last year, and if you restate used sales revenue to the same level as we had last year, so by taking out those special items that I mentioned earlier, that drops that flow-through down into the high 60s, low 70s kind of area. So, it's those kind of things that we look at and we say, okay, let's just make sure that we've got a good handle on things before we start changing and raising our guidance on EBITDA or flow-through or any of the other measures.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "I can appreciate that. Okay, thank you very much for the detail.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group.", "Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "End markets, what are your customers telling you about their expectations for 2014, and I saw your slide showing your customer survey results were very positive, so any further color you can add there about what they are saying and also what type of [indiscernible] activity maybe picks up after you rebound through this tough weather [indiscernible]?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "This is Mike. Let me just give you a few data points, one of which would be the AGC which is the Associated General Contractors came out with an outlook survey recently and they compared it to 2013 and they broke it down into numerous categories for manufacturing, retail, private office, all the way down through to marine construction. And then after that was they had how were you rating it, expect your dollar, volume or project you complete in 2014 to be either higher, lower or the same. When you aggregate all those numbers, it's a pretty interesting chart that they mapped out where manufacturing, retail, private office, hospital, power, sewer and highway were all double-digit in comparison to 2013. So that would be one data point.", "The other one would be Global Insight. Global Insight is another one that we work with, particularly with the American Rental Association, and they are seeing spending in commercial construction, office construction, lodging, retail, manufacturing and healthcare. Again, when you compare the two different ones, there are some similarities that kind of all fall altogether.", "So again, it's not a perfect science, it's another data point that we look at in comparison with [indiscernible] reports and all the other reports that come out. But those are the things that we're seeing as far as our end markets and the optimism in what our customers are telling us.", "Nicholas A. Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "Okay, that makes sense, that's helpful. And my second question is on used equipment margins. They were up a real strong 520 basis points year-over-year on an adjusted basis. How much of your used sales went to the retail channel this quarter relative to last year, just trying to kind of parse out [mentally] (ph) how much was from the [shift] (ph) \u2013 the more retail [indiscernible] strong performance in used [indiscernible]?", "William B. Plummer", "Nick, it's Bill. So operating from memory here, 55% or so was through our retail channel this year, and so that's still a fairly robust level of retail and that certainly helps support the margin. But we've also been focused on the market which is pretty robust. The pricing was pretty solid. And you combine those two things and it really does help drive the margin. So we'll continue to emphasize our retail channels, continue to try and take out as much of the auction sales as we can, continue to tap into the overall strong market pricing. There is a mix component to our margins on a year-over-year basis as well, right, the mix of units that you sell that can move things around. So that was probably part of what played into the significant increase in margin in this quarter as well, but channel mix and overall price environment were probably the bigger drivers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Manish Somaiya from Citi.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research", "Congratulations on a strong quarter. Michael, I just want to go back to your opening remarks on the cycle and I guess as we kind of see the cycle play out, how are you thinking about the up-cycle? I mean you said multi-year, but are you thinking like three-year, five-year, maybe if you can just kind of give your thoughts on that?", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Look, I have learned that my point of view, I look at the next several years. That's probably after that it gets a little foggy. But all indications are, Manish, that when you look at the Global Insight, when you look at some of the other projections that are out there, 2014, '15 and they go into '16, show nice improvement on a year-over-year basis, with 2015 being one of the strongest. I think it really what is, it's convergence of all the projects coming together in 2015. But again '16 and '17, they still remain very positive but not as great as you would see in 2015.", "All-in, they are looking at about 8% growth from Global Insight, 8.8% CAGR growth, which I think is very respectable, and those are kind of the things that we look at, but for me, I look at the next two years and I say to myself, what is it that's on our plate and what can we focus on, and do I look at the outlook outer years, absolutely, but as we get closer and closer then you get the metrics to come in and you try to validate whether those numbers are going to be plus or minus in any direction.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research", "And then, maybe a question for Matt, I guess to support this growth, organic growth, Matt, are you finding that the kind of people that you want to have on your team out there? I mean what kind of issues are you having, if any, supporting this growth via hiring the right folks with the right skills?", "Matthew Flannery", "That's a great question. We're having great success. We have a very active recruiting team out on the field that works with the regions. Sales, management, that type of talent is readily available. We've become as we've grown into the largest in the industry quite a big draw in our space. I would say, if there was anything that I worried about long-term, it would just be, like every trade, it would be the technical expertise, but we do a real good job of home-growing that talent and we've invested a lot of money in the last two years in training because we do see that as a longer-term concern about making sure we have got the skilled labor to keep this equipment running. As far as management and sales, we are very, very well set. We're fortunate, Manish, to have low turnover for about the last five years and that's really played into our favor as well. So, I don't think people will be an issue but we are always focused on it.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research", "Thanks. And then just lastly for Bill, obviously Bill, with performance having improved, with cycle showing good strength, I guess I'm trying to figure out why there is a two-notch differential in the ratings that Moody's has for senior unsecured versus S&P, and are there any discussions that you plan to have to kind of hopefully fix that?", "William B. Plummer", "We are trying to figure that one out ourselves. We have an ongoing dialog with both of the major rating agencies and both regular structured calls that we do on a quarterly basis and also ad hoc calls as things change around acquisitions or any other key items in the business. You'd have to ask Moody's how they are thinking about the rating directly. Our view is that we've delivered a capital structure and approach to managing the business that is pretty robust, but I'd point you to the Moody's folks and ask you to come back and tell me what they say.", "Manish Somaiya - Citi Investment Research", "Okay, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for closing comments.", "Michael J. Kneeland", "Thanks operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I just want to remind everybody that we were off to a strong start in 2014. When we look at the demand that we are seeing in almost every one of our markets, the confidence and the field is going upbeat, and you always find the new investor presentation on our Web-site, and as always give us a call here in Stanford if there is something that you want to discuss.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thanks operator and good morning everyone and welcome. And I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. In January, we laid out our plan for a year of profitable growth and a steady market recovery. We spoke about a balanced capital allocation program that supported both organic growth and acquisitions, the diversification of our services and our focus on return on capital. We set full year goalposts and anticipated well over $5 billion of revenue and more than $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA and significant cash flow generation. Last night, we confirmed that we expect to meet or exceed every one of our goalpost by year end. Halfway to the year, our plan has become a profitable reality for the second straight quarter.", "We deployed over $1 billion of rental CapEx to-date and realized double-digit revenue growth on our fleet. We added an important new component to our specialty range with our acquisition of National Pump and we are well into our plan on cold start openings. And we are executing a market strategy that leverages our broader service offering as well as our scale. As a result we reported another quarter of significant higher volume on a much larger fleet with no erosion of time utilization. And more importantly better rates. Our adjusted EBITDA was the second quarter record for our company. And we revised our EBITDA guidance upward to a range of $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion for the full year.", "Another one of our key metrics return on invested capital, showed real progress in the quarter, ROIC increased over 8% for the first time in our history and this has positive implications for our free cash flow. And last night you saw us raise our full year guidance for this range. These are results of the company that\u2019s firing on all cylinders in an environment of increasing demand. And once again our performance is outpacing the recovery just as we did last year. Based on our current visibility, we now expect to capture a full year rate increase of about 4.5%, which is up from our original outlook.", "Bill will discuss our results in more detail prior to taking your questions. But first I want to comment on the macro environment. I will start with the forecast from Global Insight which we agree with the salient points, Global Insight as many of you know provides a comprehensive forecasting service to our industry. Currently the expectation is for equipment and tool rental revenues in North America to grow by 7.7% this year. That\u2019s slightly down from the earlier forecast, but it\u2019s still very robust. The U.S. industry growth is estimated at 8% and Canada is just under 6%. By contrast the U.S. non-residential construction spending is expected to grow at a rate of 3% to 4% in 2014. This reflects a slow start to a year has been picking up steam since March. So in short, demand for rental equipment is projected to exceed the upswing in non-residential construction by more than two to one. Contractors are changing the way they source equipment and as the largest provider we are in a position to capitalize more strongly on that change.", "I want to make one related comment to industry growth. We are seeing very strong market for used equipment this year. Our adjusted second quarter margin on sales was up almost 49%. As we said before time utilization, rates and used equipment prices are the three main indicators of demand for equipment in our industry, so it\u2019s a very good sign to see all three of these metrics are strong. For our part we intend to remain very disciplined about our $1.7 billion of new fleet capital we are buying this year. We have high expectations for this capital and we are managing these purchases for maximum returns.", "There is no question that our end markets are getting back on track. And in second quarter all but one of our regions saw rental revenue growth and the majority of our regions had double digit growth. Demand from the energy sector is strong across the board with power plants, oil and gas and renewables such as solar and infrastructure projects have been steady. We are also seeing an upswing in commercial and office construction. When the primary project is complete, such as corporate headquarters, we can often capitalize in after growth for surrounding hotels, schools and retail centers.", "Our Specialty segment continues to turn in exceptional performance. As you know specialty rentals are an important focus for us going forward and these are high margin businesses with very attractive return on capital. They are cornerstone of our strategy to deliver superior value to shareholders. In the second quarter year-over-year our revenue from trench safety rentals was up more than 21%. And power and HVAC was up 54%. Our same store performance in these two businesses combined increased 22% over last year. So we are getting tremendous organic growth.", "And revenue from our tool assets which are rented across our regions was up almost 10%. From a market facing standpoint, the primary value to customers lies in the quality of our service and our technical expertise rather than the equipment itself. This makes specialty rentals less sensitive to price pressure particularly when it comes to providing engineered solutions. In May we added to our power HVAC group with the acquisition of Blue Stream Services, four location business based in the Gulf. Blue Stream serves a good diversity of end markets, oil and gas, disaster recovery, construction, industrial, and entertainment and it will be integrated into our network later this month.", "And of course the most significant change to our specialty segment was our acquisition of National Pump on April 1. The pump operations moved on to our IT platform in June and we are now serving customers as United Rentals Pump Solutions. Pump customers have access to our complete range of fleet and we are expanding our cross-selling of pumps to a broader customer base. We are pleased with the caliber of the pump acquisition. It brought a great team on board and it\u2019s off to a strong start. In fact, it\u2019s outperforming our plan. In the second quarter, rental revenue was up almost 62% year-over-year with an EBITDA margin of more than 50%. This acquisition also gives us an ideal platform for expansion to cold starts and at least three of our specialty openings planned for this year will be in pump.", "I also want to update you on our few internal initiatives we have in progress. First is our lean program, which I discussed last quarter and this is based on the Kaizen philosophy of improving even the best operations. So far, we have completed Phase 1, which involved 306 Kaizen events at 141 of our branches. And though it\u2019s still early, we see measurable improvements in productivity in areas, such as driver turn time and shop flow. And we feel that our targeted run rate of at least $100 million in efficiencies in three years is very achievable. Second, we are operating our business more safely than ever with a recordable rate of just below 1 through June and a 32% reduction in injuries year-over-year. And I am proud to say that we reduced our injury count more in the last six months than in the full 12 months of 2013.", "In last month, we also launched our United Academy, which is an online customer portal for safety training and certification management. Two weeks ago, we added our first blended learning programs, which provide a combination of online training with practical experience at our branches. United Academy is going to be a powerful force for safety in our industry.", "In closing, I want to say that clearly we are seeing the immediate benefit from the execution of our plan. At the same time, our strategy is built for the long-term to service well beyond 2014. We are looking at an up cycle with multiple years of industry growth. And when we apply our model to that forecast, we are excited about the kind of returns we can generate. And that\u2019s just a broader goal of value creation, but also the components of that value such as substantial free cash flow and a higher return on capital. And by all accounts, we are in a very good place with a long and profitable runway ahead.", "So, with that, I will turn the call over to Bill for the financial results and then we will take your questions. Over to you, Bill?", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone. I will center my comments around bridging our rental revenue performance for the quarter, our EBITDA performance for the quarter and then updating the outlook and along the way we will throw in hopefully some useful information about couple of other items.", "So, starting with our look at revenue performance, rental revenue in the quarter was up 16.8%, so very robust performance. Obviously, that was aided by the addition of the acquisitions in the quarter, but still when you exclude the acquisitions, pretty robust rental revenue result for us in the quarter. So, 16.8% rental revenue growth, that\u2019s $170 million of year-over-year rental revenue growth. Within rent revenue, re-rent and ancillary items accounted for 0.7% of that 16.8% growth. Ancillary in particular had a robust quarter for us. Ancillary revenue was up $24 million year-over-year within that 0.7%. Re-rent was up about $5 million, so $29 million improvement year-over-year from those two items.", "When you look at the owned equipment revenue growth that 16.1% that remains, it was driven by rental rate performance and that was up 4.9% in the quarter that was worth about $43 million of the year-over-year increase. Volume growth was very robust at 10.3% volume growth. This year, that\u2019s worth about $90 million of the year-over-year revenue and again that includes the acquisition of the acquired entities this quarter, but even if you strip out the National Pump acquisition, that volume growth was still pretty impressive at 7.6% ex-pump. So a nice volume quarter for us.", "We have been breaking out fleet inflation and the impact of that year-over-year on revenue and that this year was about 1.7 percentage points negative headwind, which resulted in about $15 million deduct from year-over-year rental revenue and probably the best way to think about that fleet inflation as we have talked before is as a net against the volume growth. FX was another headwind for us in the quarter. The Canadian dollar year-over-year was down to the extent of about 0.9% impact on our year-over-year revenue growth. So a negative 0.9% from FX or about $8 million of year-over-year deduct from the Canadian dollar move.", "The remainder, mix and other was a robust 3.5% positive in the quarter. And that positive really reflects the impact of National Pump. National Pump\u2019s volume growth is included in the 10.3% volume that I referred to earlier. And given that they have a higher dollar utilization of the fleet that they add, they substantially improve the mix result for the quarter. So, 3.5% mix and other impact in the quarter positive that\u2019s equivalent to about $31 million of year-over-year benefit from mix. So, add all those up, you get the $170 million of year-over-year rental revenue improvement, and again, it reflects what was a very good rental revenue performance for us in the quarter.", "Before I leave revenue entirely, just a quick touch on used equipment sales for the quarter, another good quarter for us on used sales, proceeds of $138 million and a margin which was very robust, 48.6% is the adjusted gross margin from our used equipment sales, that\u2019s 660 basis points better than last year. And obviously, it reflects what is a continued strong demand for used equipment in the marketplace as well as our continued focus on selling through our retail channel, which is the most attractive margin channel for our sales. So, a very nice result in used equipment for the quarter and it certainly does support the macro environment comments that Mike made about the continued strength.", "If we turn to profitability next, first looking at adjusted EBITDA, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA was up $114 million to $663 million in the quarter. That\u2019s a margin of 47.4%, which is a new record for the second quarter in our company. And looking at the breakdown of that improvement in EBITDA dollars, $114 million total year-over-year improvement. We attribute $41 million of that $114 million to rental rate, the 4.9% rental rate increase that we saw in the quarter. Volume contributed another $61 million of year-over-year growth. Netting against that would be the fleet inflation impact at EBITDA of negative $11 million.", "And then as you look at the other items in the year-over-year growth, the mix impact that I called out in revenue resulted in about $16 million of EBITDA improvement and again a very nice contribution from the addition of National Pump. The ancillary growth, that I referred to earlier, resulted in about $12 million of EBITDA benefit in the quarter and used sales also contributed nicely, about $11 million of year-over-year EBITDA growth. Working against that was our cash incentive compensation accrual in the quarter, which was up year-over-year about $12 million, so a $12 million headwind as our incentive programs reflect our increased expectations for performance over the entire year. So, it\u2019s a classic good news bad news story. Performance is better, that\u2019s great, but the incentive comp represents little bit of a headwind against that. Still the overall impact is very positive. And the remaining $4 million headwind is merit increases and some other small other nits and nats. So, all of that adds up to the $114 million of year-over-year EBITDA improvement, driving that margin which was a 190 basis point improvement in margin up to as I mentioned the 47.4% EBITDA margin in the quarter.", "Flow-through in the quarter came in at 59.1%. And in fact, it\u2019s a flow-through result in the quarter that makes us comfortable to continue to look for about 60% flow-through impact for the full year. Obviously, the flow-through reflects all of the factors that I touched on in revenue and in our EBITDA performance. It is worth noting through thought that flow-through impact in the quarter was weighed down by the addition of National Pump. As we have said before pump revenues come at about 50% EBITDA margin, so as we added in the quarter National Pump revenues we added EBITDA at about $0.50 on the $1 for those revenues. That weighs down the overall flow-through of the company and resulted in that 59.1% flow-through for the quarter.", "If you were to exclude pump the flow-through in the quarter for the full company would be more like 63%. National Pump had about four percentage point impact, negative impact on our flow-through in the quarter. We expect something comparable for the full year effect of adding National Pump this year somewhere in the 4% to 5% range for the full year impact of adding National Pump to adjusted EBITDA.", "Real quickly I will just touch on EPS for the quarter, very strong result for us at $1.65 in the quarter that\u2019s up from $1.12 in the second quarter of last year and obviously reflects all the operating points that we talked about earlier. On liquidity, capital structure, free cash flow we had a very strong free cash flow result in the quarter in the first half. First half free cash flow was $240 million and that of course reflects all the free cash flow remaining even after our CapEx spend this year. Rental CapEx was for the year-to-date period the first half was just over $1 billion of our total $1.7 billion expected spend for the year. So a pretty robust free cash flow result of $240 million for the half and puts us well on track to achieving our outlook for the full year, that free cash flow helped to maintain our ABL balances and maintain our liquidity overall. We finished the quarter with total liquidity of $1.2 billion and that includes ABL capacity of about $1 billion available to us. Along with that we also had about $170 million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.", "Our share repurchase program continue to pace in the second quarter. We bought $185 million worth of our common stock in the second quarter. That brings the cumulative program purchases to $237 million through the end of the quarter. Nice progress puts us well in our way to executing the $500 million total program that we are operating against and well on our way to executing what we have said is going to be $450 million in calendar 2014 of repurchases. So our plan still is very much to complete the program overall by April of next year.", "Before we move to the outlook just a real quick comment on ROIC, ROIC finished the quarter at 8.1% on a trailing 12 month basis through June 30 and that\u2019s an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the past year, so very nice year-over-year improvement in the trailing 12 month view of ROIC. And we continue to expect to drive ROIC higher as we go forward. It was benefited slightly by the impact of National Pump in the quarter. Excluding pump ROIC would have been right at 8% for the quarter, so it bears out the premise for investing in National Pump as we go forward.", "Our outlook you all saw we updated last night. We revised the revenue rate and free cash flow and EBITDA guidance I will leave you all to read it in detail, but we did narrow the range of total revenue that we expect in the quarter, it\u2019s now $100 million range centered around $5.6 billion. Rental revenue is within that, obviously it will be impacted by our rate expectations. We have raised our rate expectation for the year to about 4.5% from what was previously about 4% for the year, so reflecting the nice momentum that we have seen rates in the first half.", "Time utilization we continue to expect to finish the year at about 58.5%. Free cash flow, we have raised that range a little bit. We are now expecting between $450 million and $500 million of free cash flow for the full year. And our view of adjusted EBITDA is now higher. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $2.650 billion and $2.700 billion for the full year. So, those are the key points that I wanted to make. If I missed anything that you all want to talk about, please raise them in Q&A.", "So, at this point, operator we can open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Hey, good morning everybody.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning, Seth ", "William Plummer", "Good morning", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Wanted to focus a little bit on the specialty business if we could, in the press release where you are talking about the National Pump deal, you cite that purchase price of $853 versus the $780 at the time of the announcement. So, I assume that reflects confidence or line of sight to the earn-outs. Can you talk about, I mean, you said you are running ahead of plan, so should we assume that you are going to hit that first earn-out in 12 months?", "William Plummer", "Seth, it\u2019s in the Q if you look at it, the $853 is comprised of $777 I think it is of cash consideration. It excludes the stock component of the purchase. And then the remainder is the contingent consideration, it\u2019s the earn-out. It\u2019s the way that we have to account for the earn-out. So, that $76 million is an expected weighted average of the earn-out that we expect to pay discounted back to present value. Did that help?", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Yes, thank you. Okay. And is it possible to parse out how much of the upside on the rate increase goes to the 4.9 in the quarter? How much did the pump acquisition contribute to the strength in rate in the quarter? Is it possible to split that out? You kind of qualified it for their ROIC, I am wondering, if you could do that for rate?", "William Plummer", "There is no impact of rate from pump. Remember, the ARA standard calculation you used the prior year weighting for the various classes and we didn\u2019t have pump last year, so its weighting was zero in the rate calculation.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then just sticking on the specialty business, last quarter you talked about specialty getting about $240 million of the growth CapEx, I think it was a $560 million number, has that \u2013 has your thoughts around how much capital you are committing to the specialty business changed at all, you obviously didn\u2019t change your full CapEx number this year, but I am just wondering if you are committing more capital to the specialty business than you previously thought?", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, this is Matt. We are absolutely continuing to fund that business. And we were even exclusive of the pump acquisition, but we will continue to fund that business and we feel we can do that without having to raise our overall capital anymore than the guidance that we changed earlier in the year when we announced the acquisition.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "But is it still in that $240 millionish range or is it going to \u2013 I am trying to understand what percentage of the pie it\u2019s getting?", "Matt Flannery", "So, it\u2019s still in that range this year, because we don\u2019t have to fund as many cold starts in the power business that we did last year. If you recall we started a lot of power cold starts last year and not as many this year. So, it will still be in that range, but we expect as we go forward, we will \u2013 that range could increase. We are hoping it will increase actually.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And with the increased free cash flow guidance for this year, does that I must truly assume that your M&A could pickup or how do you envision spending that extra capital?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, this is Mike, Seth. I think that we are always going to be on the horizon looking as I stated in my opening comments, specialty is the cornerstone for our strategy right now. We will look and we just did the Blue-Stream, but just as I said this more than once that the bar is pretty high to get over the hurdle for us to think about it. We pass on more than we go deep in. That being said, I think our cash flow will be used right here now as to kind of pay down our debt at this point.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you very much guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from David Raso from ISI Group. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "Good morning. The free cash flow target we used to speak of the $1.5 billion from 2013 and 2015, is that still a number we should think about as a target for the three years?", "William Plummer", "Yes. Hey, David. Yes, we continue to think about that same number. Obviously, we are enhancing our chances of getting there as we raise our outlook for free cash flow this year and we will continue to work hard to hit that number and do even better if we can.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "It implies then free cash flow for \u201815 as north of $650 million and even if you do payout the earn-out to the full $125 million, you have finished the last $50 million for repo. It\u2019s going to leave your net debt at the end of \u201815 probably at or below the low end of your leverage ratio to 2.5 to 3.5 that you target. So, I was just curious if you can maybe give us some insight on where are you targeting ending \u201815 leverage? Is that math right there really tells you unless EBITDA is wildly off from when you think it would be, you are going to be below the low end of your leverage?", "William Plummer", "So, all we have said so far, David is that we will be toward the low end of that range without giving out any new guidance for 2015 I think I will stick to that. But I would just add we feel very comfortable about all of the comments that we have made about \u201815, including the contribution \u201815 makes to the $1.5 billion three-year cash flow, including the leverage being in the area of that the low end of that range. And so I won\u2019t go any further there right now. As the year plays out and as we get ourselves prepped for our Investor Day, maybe we can say more as we get later in the year.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "Well, I guess that\u2019s the related question then. Is there anything we should start thinking about the message for the December 4 meeting? There is a couple of milestones people are trying to think about, obviously at this level is there a stock split thought process, is the entry into the S&P 500 isn\u2019t really up to you, but you would think that\u2019s something that could be out there that\u2019s obviously potentially could happen, obviously some of the leverage numbers I was talking about for next year. I mean, there are some things we should be thinking about already as a framework for the message on December 4?", "William Plummer", "Okay. Five months in advance, he wants the message already. I would say stay tuned. We\u2019ll develop those thoughts as we go. Mike, I am sorry.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. So, David, we are still concentrating on this year and we will frame up our discussion points for the September meeting. You raised one there is other investors who are asking other questions as well. So, we will try to make sure that we can \u2013 we will try to answer as many as we possibly can as long as we get closer. As you know in December, we will have our understanding of what the 2015 will look from the roll up of our budget, so it will be an appropriate time in early December to have that discussion.", "David Raso - ISI Group", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead sir.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Thanks Good morning guys. Hey, one question but a couple of parts in it, I will ask it all upfront. Can you address how rental rate growth will flow over second half just a bridge the 4.5% rate guidance for the year and then the follow-ons to that are how you are thinking about rental rates long-term just with a strong year again this year with specialty. National Pump mix team and more specialty to come, what\u2019s the long-term view on that? And then lastly just kind of still on the rate theme, what the competitive environment feels like out there. It sounds like you guys are being good leaders, but just any anecdote there. Thanks. I will cut it there. Thank you very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, Scott. So, I will start with the near-term and what gave us the confidence to set a target 4.5 for ourselves for the balance of the year. If you think about that sequentially and what we would have to do, we will have to do 0.5 sequentially for the base \u2013 for the balance of our peak season, so July through October, 0.5 and then flatten out to down in November and December, that delivers a 4.5 result for the year. So, it\u2019s not a slam dunk so to speak, but we feel confident that\u2019s why we raised that guidance. As far as long-term, we hadn\u2019t put a long-term target out there yet. I will let Bill speak to it some.", "William Plummer", "Sure. But just add on to the short-term statement, so if we did that 0.5 through October Scott that would put our year-over-year third quarter rental rate performance in the high-4s and not quite 5% but in the high-4s. And that would put the fourth quarter year-over-year in the lower half of the 4s. So hopefully that gives you a little bit better sense as the second half gains year-over-year rate. For the longer term I think we have talked for a little while now that we continue to see rates over the long-term trending down from the year-over-year growth rates that they have been achieving recently, down to something that looks like 3% a year sort of a steady state. That\u2019s the way we think about our long-term forecasting. I am not saying that we will get that 3% next year, if we finish this year at 4.5 say that will be pretty good momentum carrying into next year and maybe do a little bit better than 3% next year everything else holding \u2013 the macro holding in the kind of growth rate that we are experiencing right now. But as we think about \u201916, \u201917, \u201918 something like 3% we think makes a lot of sense as a modeling assumption. And obviously the macro can swamp that for the better or for the worst, but that\u2019s how we think about the long-term.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would only add Scott that as far as the competition, I think everyone is being good stewards and marching forward. When you take a look at the Rouse report we have a bandwidth in which are leading the charge. What that band seems to be consistent by all of the report month to months which tells you that as we are growing our rate, the industry is growing our rate as well. And then I think everyone else who is public has been reporting positive number. So I think from our perspective that\u2019s how the industry has been reacting. I will also say that it\u2019s necessary because inflation kicks in prices go up and we have to earn over our cost of capital as an industry. So I think it will continue that trend. And to Bill\u2019s point the macro environment will be one of the ones that we will be able to monitor and judge the rate improvement. But I am also pointing out one last point that is we are always as a company strive to maximize our return and also on our rates.", "Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Steven Fisher - UBS", "Hi, good morning. I am wondering Bill you talked a little bit about return on invested capital, I am wondering if you are still targeting double digits by the end of 2015 and how you see the trajectory of getting to that metric, is it sort of a steady 100 basis points a quarter or now you tend to be more of a hockey stick at that end and why and I guess related to that this National Pump is the interesting in that, you are taking a local high margin product service and leveraging it across your network is part of a key element to the plan on getting to that return on invested capital you need to do more of the these things that\u2019s sort of a new business model for acquisition for you?", "William Plummer", "So, on the ROIC, just to be clear I think what we said about ROIC is that certainly we are targeting double digit 10% is our internal hurdle rate. And we have talked about achieving that in the material that we put in our investor deck achieving that over a 3 to 5 year period. So 2015 is a little more sudden than what we would say, we would expect to achieve double digit ROIC. Not impossible but that\u2019s not what we have talked about historically. I do believe that growing in the specialty areas is going to be an important component of us achieving that high level of ROIC. Again in the material we put in our investor deck there is a contribution that we have there from business mix and other and part of that business mix is from growth in the specialty areas either organic growth or indeed if we do any further acquisitions. The material we put out does not assume acquisitions, that\u2019s purely organic growth but acquisitions certainly could help accelerate that process if we found the right ones. So, I think that\u2019s the way we talk about specialty and its contribution. Specialty certainly will be an important driver, but it\u2019s not the only driver of us getting to the levels of return that we want to get to. There are things that we can continue to do in our base business and we are working very hard at those everyday.", "Steven Fisher - UBS", "And just to follow-up, what was the starting point for that three to five years, is that back from our Investor Day in 2012 or is that sort of just been ongoing?", "William Plummer", "Yes. So, that\u2019s something that we have put out in our investor material, I don\u2019t know, quarter, two quarters ago. It\u2019s based on 2013 ROIC. So, 2013 and we have targeted a three to five-year horizon of getting above 10% and we have talked about the components that we think will drive us there.", "Steven Fisher - UBS", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning. Michael, can you talk about out of the lean initiative that you mentioned what would the impact be on fleet available for rent, though it looks like in your long-term bridge you are looking for 100 basis points of utilization improvement per year? Is that the driver, I know you spoke about the cost benefit, but maybe you can touch on the utilization opportunity of the results?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I think what you are referring to is as we go to the lean process we are talking about the shop flow and turnaround time, which will be a component of not available for rent. And we \u2013 if we were to take down 2 points, that would be a substantial amount of freed up cash to deploy to put on rent. That\u2019s part of the strategy around the lean. As I mentioned, we have had 141 branches. We are seeing nice improvements in efficiencies there. And we are going to continue to focus on that. So, that\u2019s part \u2013 that would be part of our plan. I think the other part of our plan around the not available for rent is really just about discipline and fleet management. And when we took a look at the best of both worlds between United Rentals and RSC, we merged the two together. We have a gentleman who came over from RSC who is managing our fleet with the field and is doing a very good job of implying and putting that process to work. So, our processes have changed as well in the way in which we deploy capital and move our fleet, but those will be the two dynamics that we are focusing on. And if you take a look at our size of our fleet, 2 points is real money.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. And can you just talk about on the capital allocation side, which regions you are seeing outsized capital allocation, still where you are seeing the most of maybe still in the top two or three regions within your company?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. Matt?", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, sure, Jerry. So, regionally, you could imagine where the hotspots are. And although we have had broad-based growth as a matter of fact we had 12 of our 15 regions show double-digit growth and that\u2019s exclusive of pump will also obviously have robust growth. So, we are spreading the capital, but there are couple of hot pockets, where you could imagine the energy sector and not just upstream gets a lot of talk, but we are seeing capital projects at a high level in the energy sector overall, whether it\u2019s power plants or LNG plants. So, those hot pockets along the Gulf Coast and then some spots up in the Northern Midwest are certainly getting their fair share of capital, but I wouldn\u2019t point to just one or two spots where we are seeing robust growth in many of our end markets.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. I would only add that the only other thing that we are doing differently on a capital allocation is around contribution margin, not only by asset, but by customer. And that is probably one of the key takeaways of the changes in the way in which we are putting our fleet to work. So, under the gentlemen I mentioned earlier, that is being implemented through the field. They understand it. And it\u2019s a different way in which we look at the world. And therefore the monies that we talk about that the capital allocation that\u2019s one of the reasons why we will continue to make sure that the specialty businesses are well-financed and well funded for their growth. And doing it both organically as well as through cold starts and we have done two acquisitions. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about it.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "Good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "How are you?", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you for taking my question. I just want to drill a little bit deeper on rates, you mentioned that your pump business was not reflected in rate growth this quarter since it was not in the business a year ago, once National Pump does lap next year can you quantify the impact you will have on the rate growth?", "William Plummer", "George I don\u2019t think it will be a significant impact one way or another the rate growth is not dramatically different than what we are seeing in other areas. The pump story is more about getting more fleet on that, it\u2019s a volume story for us more like here now. And that\u2019s the real opportunity if I can get out there find the customers who need pumps and get those pumps in their hand. And so that\u2019s what we are chasing at. I don\u2019t think you are going to see it moving our rate performance dramatically once it does start being included.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "Very helpful. Thanks very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks George.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick Coppola from Thompson Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Nick Coppola - Thompson Research", "Good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Nick Coppola - Thompson Research", "So I wanted to ask the one question on weather here and kind of in your conversations with customers how much volume in Q2 do you think could have potentially been from work pushed out from winter weather and really just some catch up activity occurring?", "Matt Flannery", "Hi Nick, this is Matt. We are not really seeing that as something that we are hearing from our customers, it\u2019s really when you think about the cycle of a project you can ramp it up some and maybe condense the front end of it if you have a delivery date towards the end of the year and maybe you can condense some but you still got to go through the normal phases of construction. And I don\u2019t know that you condense it enough, but it would have a real impact on Q2 revenue maybe some small projects that had a very short window of needs, but that\u2019s not a monstrous spot of our portfolio. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a material and which we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a material impact.", "Nick Coppola - Thompson Research", "That makes sense. And then just my second question can you give us any color on what\u2019s been going on through the first few weeks of July here and our utilization rate kind of trending in line with your expectations and any kind of incremental color on that would be helpful?", "William Plummer", "Sure, Nick, it\u2019s Bill. Yes, the first quarter \u2013 excuse me the first parts of the third quarter early part of July things are trending nicely for us. So and very much in line with the outlook that we have given and what we expect. On the rate front, on the utilization front, volume front it\u2019s trending well. And then Matt or Michael if you guys want to add anything.", "Michael Kneeland", "No, I think you said it.", "Nick Coppola - Thompson Research", "Alright. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.", "Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research", "Good morning. First question I think is on the EBITDA incrementals into back half of the year, you had sort of expressed that there would be a little bit of a step down into 2Q and understand the National Pump impact, but as you go into the back half and sort of implying an additional step down, could you just walk through some of the components driving that?", "William Plummer", "So, in the back half I think the key things to remember are the impact that we will see on the year-over-year rental rates. I think I mentioned that before with the fourth quarter in particular being a little bit less of a year-over-year improvement than what we have seen in the first few quarters of the year in the lower half of 4s instead of in the upper half of 4s where we have been. We have got the year-over-year impact of items like our bonus accrual I mentioned that in our bridge of EBITDA. Compared to last year our bonus and the compensation expenses are going to be up a little bit. Used sales is a significant impact in the second half versus the first. Remember, if you go back to that first quarter our used sales were actually down year-over-year and used sales bring a lower margin than the rest of the company. So as they go down they actually help the flow-through. That was a pretty significant impact in the first quarter. And so that impacted the first half flow-through positively and therefore the second half should be a little bit less. What else, the pump acquisition obviously will be a significant impact I called that out already 4% to 5% impact, depressing the second half and therefore pushing it down versus the first half.", "I think the important thing to focus on is the full year flow-through that we expect is still about 60% and that\u2019s including the impact of pump. If you excluded pump the full year would be a little higher. And therefore the second half would be a little higher than what maybe you are calculating just based on the outlook that we have given. And truth told if you have put a gun to my head I said this last night to a couple of folks. If I had best weather it would be little higher or little lower than that 60%. I bet right now maybe a little higher. So I think that flow-through is shaping up nicely for the year.", "Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research", "That was really helpful. Thank you. And then just components of growth obviously the National Pump impact on mix in the quarter, I think from the Q it says that the mix effect is still a headwind on the general rental side, but just how to think about mix into the back half of the year and sort of net effective of inflation and mix to growth?", "Michael Kneeland", "But I think if you think about the back half as comparable to the second quarter from a mix impact perspective that will be a good start on how to model it. So as I said earlier about 3.5 percentage points of the 16.8 rental revenue growth that we had came from mix, I think if you did that again for third and fourth quarter that will be a good starting point.", "Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research", "Great, thanks very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Robinson from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Tim Robinson - Susquehanna", "Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.", "Michael Kneeland", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Tim Robinson - Susquehanna", "I just want to ask real quick about SG&A and it (picked) up, it sounds like it was mostly incentive comp and I am assuming acquisition out of the costs as well, I was just wondering if there is anything else and that we should be aware of and how you would encourage us to think about the 187 as a run rate going forward?", "William Plummer", "Nothing else major to call out Tim in SG&A, the incentive comp was the big driver. As you go forward again there is nothing major that I would call after the second half. So I think you can safely use the run rate obviously we will have the impacts of the selling cost based on your revenue estimates, we will have puts and takes incentive line items. But nothing major that we point out.", "Tim Robinson \u2013 Susquehanna", "Got it. And then real quick if you would hit your rate guidance for the year, what would that imply for a carry over the pricing heading into 2015?", "William Plummer", "Give me second Tim here and we will dig that up. Its normally in the 2% area maybe a touch higher but we will dig it up real quick and through it out before the call end.", "Tim Robinson \u2013 Susquehanna", "Perfect. Well, thanks a lot. That\u2019s all I have.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Good morning guys. So just a question on CapEx I know we talked a little about the potential for our additional M&A with your free cash flow for the rest of the year, but I am just curious what would cause you guys to take up your CapEx plans from the $1.7 billion for 2017, is there anything or is that pretty much you would say like locked and loaded for the year?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike and I will ask Matt to join in and Bill too as well. But for me I would like to see both rate and time utilization grow and particularly as it applies to our contribution margin in areas that we can really get nice returns on. But those are probably the two dynamics. That being said it\u2019s also I want to make sure with the management team that we are not just buying for today. We are buying for multiple years. So but they can put that equipment to use longer term and but rate and time utilization that combination may give me the opportunity to think differently.", "Matt Flannery", "And I think so, this is Matt, Nicole. I somewhat passed earlier about what kind of impact lean could have on OEC NA and OEC not available. So, as we continue to drive our lean initiative throughout the organization we are about 20% to 25% of our stores impacted already. We actually hope will create more capacity for growth within the capital that we have. So, we really have gotten our team away from the thinking that I need $2 of capital to drive $1 of growth revenue and that\u2019s really part of our goal and part of the reason why we want to stay disciplined on our capital spend.", "Michael Kneeland", "And the only thing I would add, Nicole, is that all of those factors we would mix in along with the impact on cash flow. We take cash flow pretty seriously. And as long as we don\u2019t feel that we are doing significant damage to our cash flow and in the long run we are enhancing our cash flow as a company that would be a factor in deciding to spend more capital as well. Just to go back to Tim\u2019s question about carryover rate if we did 4.5 this year, I think 2% is probably a good number to use right here now. So, just Tim, I wanted to follow up on that.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks for the color on the CapEx guys. And just one more for me, I mean, Mike\u2019s comments about commercial construction were pretty bullish, I am just curious are you guys actually seeing real tangible signs of that recovery or is that more a reflection of just customer confidence and their recovery getting better?", "Matt Flannery", "Hi, Nicole, it\u2019s Matt again. I would say it\u2019s both. So, you see in our deck that our customer confidence is the best results in our survey that we have seen all year, including last year. And we also have seen a robust pipeline of large projects and that\u2019s a core competency, not just of ours, but of our key accounts. So, we expect to get our fair share plus of participation in those projects. And I had mentioned earlier all the jobs in the power sector and the LNG probably the most renowned one is the (indiscernible) project down in the Gulf Coast, but we have got stadiums popping up in different markets. We have got large retail popping up in different markets and really a robust pipeline of major projects throughout the country.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thank you guys so much.", "Matt Flannery", "Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Michael Kneeland for closing remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thanks operator. I want to remind everyone that our annual Investor Day in New York has been scheduled for December 4. So, I hope you all attend and join us on our webcast, but more information will come forward as we get closer to that date. In the meantime, please download our current investor update or our updated investor presentation that we have.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks operator and good morning everyone and welcome and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Tony will talk about how we\u2019re managing the business in light of our expectations for 2015 with almost four months of the year behind us we\u2019ve able to draw off some conclusions of how this year is shaping up, I want to talk more about that in a minute and then Bill will cover the results and followed by your questions.", "First speaking with the numbers you saw last night, we had a solid start to the year. Our revenue, EBITDA and the internal invested capital are first quarter records. And that's the credit to our employees. Our rental revenue increased 12% year-over-year based in part on an 8% increase in volume. We generated $602 million of adjusted EBITDA at a 46% margin. Our return on invested capital improved to 9% and our free cash flow for the quarter was $450 million more than 60% higher than a year ago.", "We also reported record adjusted EPS of $1.34 for the quarter. Now we achieved these results despite some notable headwinds. The most significant constraint was the decline in upstream oil and gas activity. The rapid shutdown of almost 50% of drilled rigs had both the direct and knock-on effect and this was felt more strongly in our pump operations. The slowdown also happened earlier than expected and we now think slightly to continue to at least the next three to six months. We still expect to mitigate the decline within our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and will have more opportunities to do that now during the peak seasonality.", "Given the timing of the impact, we felt that it was realistic to narrow the ranges of revenue and EBITDA. Our updated revenue range is 6 billion to 6.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 2.95 billion to 3 billion. These two ranges still fall within our original outlook.", "Now in addition, in the first quarter we had a negative currency impact from a relatively weaker Canadian dollar and this will likely impact our year-over-year comparisons throughout 2015. In the harsh winter, slow the pace of the projects in several regions or we dealt with historical cold and snow. And with that one we can safely say that's behind us. But despite these headwinds we put a record $5.4 billion of OEC on that in the first quarter in a highly competitive marketplace.", "We could live with that but as you know [indiscernible] from looking at numbers from every angle. And in the first quarter the metrics of time utilization and rate merit further discussion. Time utilization decreased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 64%. That hasn\u2019t changed our outlook, we are still comfortable with our full year time utilization of approximately 69% and when we look at branches without any meaningful exposure to upstream oil and gas activity, time utilization was actually up 40 basis points in the quarter.", "With pricing our rate increased 2.9% in the quarter first last year and that was lower than expected and we are now anticipating a very competitive rate environment going into the summer months. But, I know that there our field management, fields like I do that these are \u2013 there are actions that we can take the [rentals] prices up. Coming off the quarter we now expect our rate increase to be about 3% to the full year instead of the original outlook of 3.5%.", "Regardless of any headwinds, we will continue to transfer underutilized fleet to areas of higher demand where our sales force has more leverage to negotiate rate and we will have even more opportunity to get the equipment on rent as we go into our seasonality as it picks up. We are focused on achieving that optimal balance of metrics that we have talked about before that is where rate and time utilization intersect to drive returns. We see this as being absolutely essential as we continue to capitalize on the up cycle. And a large measure is within our control regardless of external developments.", "Now let's turn to the marketplace starting with specialty rentals the organic revenue growth in our specialty segment was 25% in the quarter and EBITDA was up 57% trench safety and power were particularly strong. Specialty rentals are a high margin business and help drive our fifth consecutive first quarter increase at EBITDA margin company wide. We will expand all of our specialty lines this year with an addition of approximately 18 new branches. This will give us the strategic presence in new trade areas and strength in our cross-selling abilities.", "From a broad perspective our operating environment continues to match up favorably against last year. Our sales force is reporting high level of project starts and if anything our customers are even more optimistic than we were in December. And this is true of our large national accounts as well as regional operators and local contractors. We are serving a diverse customer base that has maintained a healthy balance year-over-year going into April. Key accounts represent 65% of our base by revenue that includes national accounts at 46% of our base. And our local customers, which we classify as unassigned account picked up slightly to 35%.", "Now turning to geography, on a constant currency basis, all but one of our regions are year-over-year growth and that one is nearly flat. The mid Atlantic south, mid west and mountain west regions had a particularly strong quarter. And I want to give a nod to our industrial team which has continued to score wins in the downstream energy sector. And then she gets bad rap right now but from our perspective we are seeing some impressive numbers.", "We currently have commitments for eight multi-billion dollar energy projects, four which are underway, two are in the [dirk] stage and the other two will kick off in 2016 and 2018, all of these are three to six year projects in Texas and Louisiana. But beyond energy we are seeing many different sectors pickup for example, our major infrastructure project \u2013 renovations in Ottawa and Montreal. Large stadium projects in Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale and renewable such as wind farms in Kansas and I want to share something here about Texas which is a large and diversified markets for us.", "If you exclude pump the increase in rental revenue was in the mid teens on a year-over-year basis. That points to a solid demand outside of upstream oil and gas. We have always have to write out some sector related cycles but the fundamentals of our markets are very strong. We should see broad based growth well beyond 2015 as our customers take on more work and secular penetration adds an extra layer of demand. Most industry forecast supports this view. One recent release is the consensus construction report put up by the American Institute of Architects that takes into account seven major forecasters including Dodge and Moody\u2019s. Report concludes that commercial constructions, which is our bread and butter as forecaster remain on a strong upward trajectory hotels, office buildings, and retail are just some of the areas \u2013 just few of some of the areas projected to contribute to that growth.", "And the institutional sector which had disciplined decline in 2014 appears to have bottomed out. The consensus is that institutional construction will reverse to a gain in 2015 and climb again in 2016 and that's good news for markets such as health, education and public safety.", "So that gives you an idea of where we see the challenges and the opportunities in 2015 and to some degree in 2016 as well. Taking everything into consideration we remain confident in our full year guidance of adjusted EBITDA of at least 2.95 billion on total revenue of at least 6 billion. Balancing these metrics behind those numbers in light of the market dynamics and we expect to spend $1.7 billion of gross rental CapEx this year as planned.", "Now in short we show that we have the right plan, we know we have the right plan in place for 2015 and our strategy for long term profitable growth remains intact.", "So with that I will ask Bill to cover the financial results and then we will take your questions. So over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Mike and good morning to everyone. We have got a lot to cover here so I am going to try and streamline my comments about the actual, so we can save a little time to touch on the refinancing that we did, touch on our oil and gas experience for the first quarter and also the outlook.", "Real briefly on the financials, we had a good revenue result in the quarter. Rental revenue was up by almost 12%, 11.9% as Mike called out let's say $120 million improvement and the drivers were \u2013 the ancillary and re-rent revenue performance for the quarter was good. We had about $14 million year-over-year improvement from those two combined. The bulk of it being ancillary pickup delivery and our RPP program, re-rent was just a little better than flat year-over-year so that was about $14 million of the 120. Within owned equipment revenue, OER, rental rate growth you saw was 2.9%, we translate that into about a $26 million improvement over the last year. On the volume front we had 8.1% volume improvement and that translates into about $72 million of volume impact which I will note includes the impact of having pump this year and not in the first quarter of last year.", "Also sprinkle throughout the volume and some of the other lines is the FX impact that we experienced in the quarter. I will summarize that at the end. Inflation, replacement CapEx inflation we called it about 2.1% for the quarter and that's the headwind of just under $19 million year-over-year, and then mix all other including some portion of FX accounted for $27 million year-over-year that includes the impact again of the pump acquisition as we talked before pump not only contributed through the acquisition but has a more attractive mix than the rest of the business. And so that was the significant part of that $27 million.", "So those were the key components of the $120 million improvement and I will just call out separately if you aggregate all of the currency impacts, we estimate that currency cost us about $16 million of rental revenue year-over-year and that certainly is a significant headwind when you think about the growth that we were able to experience.", "The only other revenue comment that I will make is about used equipment sales, we had another good used equipment sales result in the quarter $116 million and that's up about 6% from last year and also very importantly very robust 50.7% adjusted gross margin for the quarter and as has been the case that was helped not only by solid pricing in the quarter, pricing is measured by proceeds as a percentage of OEC was just under 50% in the quarter. But it was also was supported by our continued focus on the retail channel to get the best margin result there and so selling about 61% of our used sales through retail channel was a nice support for the results.", "Turning quickly to profitability at EBITDA first, adjusted EBITDA 602.2 was a company record for the quarter as Mike pointed out. As was the adjusted EBITDA margin, 45.8% it was a very robust margin so that's $83 million worth of dollar improvement over the last year and 170 basis points worth of margin improvement as well. Flow through in the quarter was strong at 60.6% and we will certainly touch on some of the drivers there in the year-over-year EBITDA Bridge.", "Speaking of which that $83 million of improvement was driven by volume, primarily volume was up about $51 million of the $83 million year-over-year improvement, rental rates contributed another $24 million toward that 83 improvement. The Cat.Class mix primarily from the impact of adding pump we would call that about $14 million of incremental improvement and then we also had the improvement from ancillary and re-rent revenues that I called out earlier that's about a $7 million improvement on the incremental of 14 million of revenue that I called out.", "Incentive compensation accrual for the first quarter this year compared to last year reflecting some of the headwinds that we experienced with oil and gas, weather and currency so that contributed $6 million of year-over-year improvement. Used equipment sales already called out the sales margin improvement that was about $5 million of improvement and then a few headwinds items.", "The fleet inflation and mix component combined was about $13 million headwind versus last year. Bad debt expense we reverted to a more normal bad debt expense this year compared to a solid bad debt expense performance last year so that cost us about $8 million in year-over-year EBITDA and then merit increases were about $6 million of the impact this year as well at least about 3 million of all other knits and knots combined. So all in all, a very robust EBITDA result in the quarter even in spite of the headwinds. As Mike called out on EPS, it was a great EPS result for the quarter as well a $1.34 that\u2019s up almost 50% against the $0.90 of adjusted EPS that we delivered in the first quarter last year. So another good result there.", "Moving onto free cash flow, continue the good result commentary $450 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and that\u2019s up from $278 million in the first quarter of last year with minimal merger related adjustments showing up in the current quarters, it\u2019s only about a million dollar worth of merger related payments. So, the way we talk about free cash flow on an adjusted basis we would call $451 million. A variety of different drivers including the operating profitability we also had lower AR and the timing of some of the other working capital payments were also favorable for us primarily accounts payable.", "Rental CapEx for the quarter was $323 million and that certainly a start consistent with the comments we have made previously about the timing of CapEx this year looking similar to last year. As you saw in the outlook we continue to expect to spend a billion seven in gross capital this year for a net of about 1.2 billion. The net rental CapEx in the quarter was just under 210 million for the quarter.", "On capital structure and liquidity a busy quarter in capital structure actions, you all seen that we refinanced two of our outstanding issues we issued the calls on the [indiscernible] senior subordinated notes and the five and three quarters senior secured notes. We refinanced those issues by issuing two new issues a billion dollars of 4 and 5As, eight year senior secured notes and then another $800 million worth of 10 year senior unsecured.", "Very attractive overall impact for those refinancing transactions but we didn\u2019t stop there, we also amended and extended our ABL facility and increased this size as well so the ABL is now up to $2.5 billion we then drew on that new and improved ABL and used it to partially call the 8% and 1.25% senior notes.", "And I go through all of that just to note that the timing of those transactions were split between first quarter and second quarter and so as you think about the results in first quarter and as you anticipate the results for the second quarter you have to remind yourself that we will some impacts in the second quarter from those first quarter transactions.", "In particular we\u2019ll report in the second quarter about $121 million loss on the redemptions that covers both the premium of calling the outstanding notes as well as writing off any remaining deferred financing costs that will happen in the second quarter. When you aggregate it all together we expect that the aggregate run-rate of interest expense reductions from all those transactions should come in to an improvement of about $48 million a year so that gives you a summary. And to put it even more directly our interest expense estimate for cash interest this year, excuse me GAAP interest this year we expect to be about $460 million. So hopefully that will help you as you think through all those transactions.", "Real briefly on ROIC, company record ROIC result in the quarter 9% and that was a 120 basis points compared to first quarter last year and 20 basis points better than in the fourth quarter. So despite all the headwinds as Michael discussed we continue to be on a path to improving our ROIC which has been a major focus of our efforts. And even with the revised guidance that we provided, we fully expect a very nice improvement in ROIC as we go through the full 2015 year.", "Before I finish up with the outlook just real brief summary of our progress in oil and gas. We talked in the first about a downside oil and gas scenario and I just wanted to provide a couple of data points about progress against oil and gas and how we compare with that downside. We call that about a $400 million maximum fleet size impact from the downside scenario we laid out. You\u2019ll also recall that we said that $400 million impact we modeled it as hitting us in the second quarter. Obviously we didn\u2019t expect it would be zero impact until June and then 400 from June on, but we certainly modeled it that way. So that 400 maximum impact averaged out to a $200 million OEC impact over the course of 2015.", "We\u2019re about halfway to that $400 million maximum impact just based on the path of fleet in our oil and gas branches. And in particular when you look at those oil and gas branches most of the impact that we\u2019ve seen has come from the oil and gas branches that have the highest share of their revenue from oil and gas. If the branch has more than 20% of their revenue from oil and gas in aggregate those branches have seen about a $200 million equivalent OEC impact. For the branches that have less than 20% of their share in oil and gas there has been virtually no impact. So, we find that to be a very interesting feature of how oil and gas is progressing throughout our branches.", "The thing as Mike pointed that surprises a little bit is that the impact came a little sooner than what we expected but certainly not outside the context of the size of what we expected. But the fact that it came sooner means that it will an effect over the remainder of the year longer than the way we modeled the downside. So, when you net it all together we\u2019re proud they\u2019re seeing an impact through the full 2015 calendar year on something in the area of 88% of full downside impact that we talked about previously. We call that $36 million of EBITDA as you all recall and so, we proudly say that we\u2019re seeing something like a $32 million EBITDA impact assuming oil and gas maintains at the level that it is currently. That is not an unreasonable assumption given that when we look at our oil and gas branches we\u2019re seeing a slowdown in the decline, in fact, if you look at all of our oil and gas branches for the months of March and so far in April, we\u2019ve actually seen a slight sequential increase in fleet on rent in those branches. So that gives us some level of encouragement that the decline has slowed if not completely arrested.", "The question is where to go from here and that\u2019s going to be the wildcard and we can talk more about that in Q&A if anybody is interested. So that\u2019s the oil and gas picture at a very high level, the last thing I would like to update is just the outlook. You saw the announcement essentially what we do is to take off the top end of the revenue and EBITDA ranges, reduce the expected rental rate realization and left everything else unchanged. And we think that\u2019s a very realistic view of where we will be for 2015.", "So, the outlook now is for rental revenue \u2013 excuse me, total revenue in the range of 6 billion to 6.1 billion and within that as I said we expect rental rates to be approximately 3% for the full year. Time view, we\u2019ve not changed our view 69% for the full year or an increase of about 20 basis points and an adjusted EBITDA we\u2019re now in the range of 2.950 billion to 3 billion for that measure. We\u2019re continuing to target a 1.7 billion of gross capital spend for a net of about 1.2 billion and we continue to expect free cash flow to be centered around 750 with 725 on the low side and 775 on the high side. All of that will net out to our continued expectation of leverage at the end of the year at about 2.6x, net debt to EBITDA and that assumes that we complete the share repurchase program at $500 million in calendar 2015.", "You all saw that we did spend about $316 million on share repurchase in the first quarter that brought in 3.5 million shares at an average price of about $89.16 in the quarter and we continue to believe that spending on a path to 500 is the right place to be for right now for 2015. Obviously we\u2019ll continue reevaluate as we see how profitability and cash flow develop as well as how the stock price trades.", "So, those are the key points that I wanted to make and certainly would welcome all your questions. It was a solid quarter for us, when you step back and look at the results with some headwinds that not only had we to deal within the first quarter we\u2019ll have to continue deal with going forward. But, we\u2019ve got confidence that we got a program that can get us to the outlook that we\u2019ve given and certainly will update you as we go forward.", "So with that operator I\u2019ll ask you to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Seth Weber from RBC Capital, your question please.", "Seth Weber", "Hi, good morning everybody.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning Seth.", "Seth Weber", "I\u2019m wondering can you talk a little bit more about the redeployment, Bill I think you mentioned, you\u2019ve seen about $200 million of fleet that\u2019s been affected so far in the oil and gas regions. I mean, can you size for us how much of fleet you\u2019ve redeployed year-to-date so far, where is it going, is it going into the region, is it going out of state to just to non-residential construction markets. And I guess, can you talk, how do you think the non-res markets are going to shape up competitively, we\u2019ve heard anecdotally about the independents kind of adding more fleet recently, I think Michael you mentioned competitive pricing so can you help us kind of frame all that stuff, thanks?", "William Plummer", "Sure Seth, I will start with sizing and Mike, Matt you guys if you want to chime in on words going. The way we look at it we got about $80 million of fleet that have come out of oil and gas branches going into non-oil and gas branches and primarily that $80 million has come out of the branches that more than 20% share of branches that I mentioned earlier. So the issue has been concentrated in those high share oil and gas branches and we responded there with the de-fleeting of about $80 million so far. The challenge of course is putting that fleet on rent usefully elsewhere we think we stepped up to the challenge. It is more of a challenge in the first part of the year than it will be in the second and third quarters in particular just given the relative busyness of those quarters compared to first quarter. So, we are encouraged by our ability to mitigate by moving fleet around as to where it\u2019s going and so that the environment that is facing you guys want to add anything.", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. Yes Seth, so we are seeing and you can look at the construction growth maps that are in the deck on slide 14 specifically of where the demand is and we are shipping the assets to where the demand is. The good news as Bill said that demand will increase as we get into our -- the seasonal uptake will be in our favor. And as we look at our non-oil and gas branches the encouraging news is that they are acting very similar to how we expect them to act to how they have acted in the past and as we sit here today we are seeing both time and sequential rate in those non-oil and gas branches yet the ramp up that we need to hit our goal so that's where it\u2019s going to go, the end markets and the demand tell us that the opportunities is there and most importantly we have the team and the customers and the footprint to deploy it there.", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, I will only add that I think you asked the question where is it going and its actually most of it is staying within the region where it\u2019s coming off rent. We are doing transfers we are also doing sales and redeployment of capital that's an ongoing effort for us and we will continue to do that but I also want to point out one thing if you recall over the last several years we have been very disciplined in the way in which we have given our capital and over the years many of our non-oil and gas regions have been looking for fleet. So this is their opportunity, they are taking it and we are supplying them.", "Seth Weber", "Okay. And if I can just on \u2013 as a follow-up to that I mean can you just talk about how deep into the year and where do you expect to make the CapEx your billion seven CapEx decision where does kind of \u2013 where do we kind of get to the fork on the road on the billion seven number is it if you don't see trends and pick up is it May or June or how deep into the construction session will you go with that versus just continue to move more fleet around?", "William Plummer", "Yes, I will start Seth, and the guys will chime in please. I think maybe it would be helpful to come at it from the other direction. How late can we go before we have to make a decision about reducing CapEx if we decide there and the answer is [indiscernible] I mean as we top it for we don't have a lot of \u2013 we don't have the cancellation penalties or lot of constraint on our ability to pullback once we placed orders up until the point that shipped we can cancel it for the most part. And so that gives us a tremendous runway to make that call. Certainly we want to see how the second quarter ramps up and get a real solid feel for that before we start making any decisions.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, the only thing I will add to that is we are not \u2013 we don't need to make that decision and we are not trending towards that decision because as you look at the data, when you take pumps out of the equation even absorbing oil and gas we are ten bips down in the first quarter and that\u2019s improving and when you look at the non-oil and gas branches in Q1 they were actually 40 bips up on a year-over-year basis so if we deliver 3% rate 79% time that's the good reason to spend that 1.7, we do have the flexibility in case anything changes as Bill stated but we feel good about being able to deploy that as well as 18 constructs that we are doing in the full year many of which are opened already. So actually it\u2019s 21, its specialty and 3 general that we have already opened up. So those are all the reasons why we feel like deploying the capital is something that we will be able to do.", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, it was 69% time not 79%.", "Seth Weber", "Thank you very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please.", "William Plummer", "Hey Ted.", "Ted Grace", "Hey gentlemen. How are you?", "Michael Kneeland", "Good Ted. Doing well.", "Ted Grace", "I was wondering if you could walk through the sequential progression of time utilization in 1Q and then pretty much kind of like what\u2019s happened in April, what gives you confidence that trajectory can reverse out that a lot of the challenges they are reversing out. I know you mentioned that the oil and gas branches that rate of decline has slowed dramatically but could you maybe just help quantify that with some of the time utilization data points that you can talk about?", "Matt Flannery", "Sure Ted, its Matt. So the time utilization in January was 63.7% and February was 63.9% and in March it was 64.9% and when we talk about April we see that gap that March was our biggest gap on the year-over-year perspective we see that gap narrowing and as we sit here today we are very close to and this is all in, this is not just non-oil and gas we are very close to being on top of year-over-year time utilization. More importantly as we look at the OEC on rent bill, we have had a very strong two weeks and this is when we need that bill. April, May and June or Q2 is where the bill has to come and we are expecting to cross over the year-over-year time utilization somewhere in mid May that's our target that's what\u2019s got to happen and then have some sequential improvements from there on a year-over-year basis as well as seasonal increase. So that I don't if I answered your question that's the data that we are sharing today.", "Ted Grace", "Yes that's helpful. I think that helps. People understand kind of what that curve looks like. And then I think did you mention that in the first quarter non-oil and gas branches time utilization is up 40 basis points?", "Matt Flannery", "Yes.", "Ted Grace", "Okay, versus the recorded of negative 40?", "William Plummer", "That's right. Correct.", "Ted Grace", "Okay and then okay that's really helpful. The second thing I wanted to ask is just as a follow up on Seth\u2019s question on oil and gas exposure. Quarter ago you walked through the frame work its very helpful you updated data the reasonable worst case scenario is 88% to that $36 million did I hear that correctly is that you still feel that the reasonable worst case scenario is that $36 million or I just want to make sure we understand what the updated kind of messages on the frame work?", "William Plummer", "Yes, we do still think that's the reasonable way to think about maximum downside Ted as I said the impact came sooner in the year than what we modeled certainly and then what we expected quite honestly. So but yes, I would still say that $36 million is a reasonable downside scenario. Remember when I said the 88% the $32 million I think I said of impact is our view right now that's excluding some of the mitigation that we have been and will be doing over the course of the year. That $80 million of fleet that I said came out of oil and gas and went into other non-oil and gas branches. We haven't given any benefit for mitigation from that fleet being moved the way it has. So that's why we think that the $36 million is still a reasonable downside for EBITDA impact from oil and gas this year.", "Ted Grace", "Okay and so the last thing I would ask, you squared up that against the updated EBITDA guidance 2.95 to 3.0 you kind of hit 25 at the midpoint. How much of that is the updated oil and gas expectations just to understand how that\u2019s baked into the updated guidance?", "William Plummer", "We work that explicit when we set the range and therefore set the midpoint on the new guidance Ted, what I would say is that what we feel is that if oil and gas continues where it is now or even deteriorates a little bit more it would have been a part of the reduction in the midpoint of the range but not the entire reduction, right would still certainly have the impact to currency that\u2019s continuing throughout the course of the year. We did have the weather impact and we are going to claw away back from that in the second quarter here that continue to impact the full year, so I don\u2019t know how to categorize it numerically but I say oil and gas was part of it but everything else we experience in the first quarter was part of it.", "Michael Kneeland", "The only thing I would add Ted is and there is a $25 million number on rate so just absorbing that half a point of rate change is part of that.", "Ted Grace", "Okay. Well solid quarter guys and best of luck this quarter.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Hi, yes. Thanks guys. Good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Nicole.", "Nicole DeBlase", "My first question is just clarifying Ted\u2019s points so the 32 million and I\u2019m sorry if we\u2019re going on about this but the 32 million impact that you guys now expect from oil and gas, is that fully baked into your guidance, like is it in the low end, is it in the midpoint, is it in the high end of new EBITDA range?", "William Plummer", "It is baked into our guidance. We are not characterizing whether it puts us at the low, medium or higher. It\u2019s in our thinking when we set the guidance to start.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay, got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then my second question is it seems to me like the new 3% rate guidance is assuming that we kind of get normal seasonality from here which make sense and you guys are already trying to see a pickup in those oil and gas states, but I guess my question is what you see from a rate perspective quarter-to-date during early April, does that gel with a 3% rate guidance that you have and what\u2019s the downside risk at that point that we could have a down revision, what would we need to see the deterioration in oil and gas prices in market for that outcome to occur?", "Matt Flannery", "Sure Nicole, I will take that it\u2019s Matt. So as far as the rate guidance what we are seeing in April is that we\u2019ve gotten back to flat and now we can get our sequential clients that we need that as you pointed out. We usually get into season and you are looking at about six tenths a month May through November and then a small drop in December and something that looks similar to that and the good news is as we look at our history we have done that before. So between the strengthening end market and the fact that we have the tools and the capability of doing it is why we felt comfortable setting that target at 3.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay got it. Thank you. I will pass it on. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Good morning guys. I am just curious with regard to the guidance and the softness in the quarter with regard to rate could you address 4X, I think you talked about the rental revenue impact in the quarter could you speak to EBITDA and then just other drivers of the rate guidance is it predominately the oil impact are there other things on asset class geography?", "William Plummer", "So on currency I called out $16 million of revenue impact in rental revenue and about $7 million in EBITDA as we look for the full year of currency stays -- you can use 60 and 30 as the full year impacts for the remainder of 2015 and that is considered in our guidance as well. So that's the currency story. Then I am sorry what was the other part of your question Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks its helpful enough Bill, I guess just as a follow-on when moving around assets from the oil locations, could you speak to the asset classes that are being moved and what's just coming off and not going back and what are the asset classes that you are moving and what's having more success or not and how that ties the rate as well. Thanks.", "Matt Flannery", "Sure Scott. It\u2019s Matt. So as far as the assets that are moving, what you would expect rich forkless, some boom, some light towers, as well as pumps. If you ask me which one are the most challenge to move, until we further build our footprint we have headwind to move in the pumps as fast as we move the other more fungible assets but that was always our game plan when we made the pump acquisition was to grow out that footprint and penetrate other markets as well as chasing our cross sell opportunity. You will see in the slide deck and I think its slide 35 that we have identified $80 million of cross sell opportunity. So we don't only have the strategy and the hope we actually have the opportunity to continue to move some of those pumps out of the oil and gas and into existing customers through cross sell. So stay tuned for what our close rate will be but there is an opportunity out there that we have identified and that we are chasing and that would be the last part of the asset class that we need to move more aggressively it would be the pumps. ", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc.", "Joe Box", "Hi guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Joe.", "Joe Box", "Mike you said earlier that you expect the competitive rate environment as we start to get into the summer months. I am curious is that across the board or is that much more concentrated in the energy exposed markets and I apologize if I missed this earlier but do you give us a break down on rental rates within the energy markets versus outside?", "Michael Kneeland", "We gave the -- its hard for us to break it that way because the way in which we do the ARA, it\u2019s a weighted average on the asset class. It\u2019s hard to break it out that way. With regards to the competitive marketplace I just think that typically look we all have a bad winner, we all had the oil and we see that the competitive marketplace will change as the season swings to a more seasonal opportunity. So, we just see being more competitive. I wouldn't take it anything more than that\u2019s a nutshell.", "Joe Box", "I mean do you think it\u2019s fair to say that inside energy is negative and outside energy is kind of in-lined with that 3.5% plus that you had highlighted earlier?", "Michael Kneeland", "I would say that -- I would quantify it by saying that the non-ONG would be, you would see a normal trend that you would normally see that we have experienced overtime as opposed to what we with the \u2013 when you add the ONG in it gives us that full impact.", "Joe Box", "Understood. One last one for you. Bill it looks like there is only about a $6 million difference between the revenue contribution that you are getting from rental rates and then the offset from fleet inflation and that doesn't give you a whole lot of wiggle room, we know what you are guiding for rental rates but what are you expectations for fleet inflation. I am kind of curious if rental rates continue to exceed inflation or if they got a parity or even negative from here?", "William Plummer", "Yes, the expectation is for fleet inflation to continue sort of the trend that has been, we are replacing something like 15% of our fleet every year and we continue to experience inflation on new purchases at something like the couple of percent a year so when you aggregate that over the average life what we are replacing we are going to stay in that 2% area for fleet inflation going forward and so if we deliver the above 3% that we are talking about for rental rates we still got a spread. My expectation is that the inflation won't change dramatically and I certainly expect that that will continue to drive rates as hard as we can, so I won't give you a long range forecast, we talked about delivering 3% a year rental rate improvement over the long haul for a long time that\u2019s been our long term view. Oil and gas has made that challenging this year but I don\u2019t see a reason to change that longer term view as we said right here.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, Joe. I would only add that aside from just rate is not the only thing that we are leaning on, we are also looking at driving efficiencies in our process improvements. We continue to march down that path and so we are looking at ways in which we can become more efficient and driving not only our fleet but also our cost structure around that process.", "Joe Box", "Understood. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, David.", "David Raso", "The rest of the year guidance that the first quarter incremental EBITDA number was some and margin was pretty healthy, it was 61% but when you look at the rest of the year guidance it requires a bit of step up with the incremental EBITDA margin has to be around 76% ahead of the year. So I\u2019m just kind of walk through either some cost reductions that we can think about to expect the incremental EBITDA margin to accelerate that much as the year goes on or mixed issue, I think you can just dive into that a little bit of more.", "William Plummer", "Yes, thanks David. So I called out the impact of one particular item bonus accrual difference year-over-year was $6 million in the first quarter, if we continue on the path that we are on that\u2019s going to continue to contribute as we go throughout the rest of the year. In fact the contribution will increase because last year we increased our bonus accrual as the year were on second half we ran very strong versus our plan and so we accrued up to a much higher level for last year\u2019s bonus. This year assuming we stay and deliver the guidance that we have given it\u2019s going to be less and so that $6 million will go up a little bit in future quarter. So that will help and as you know the incremental margin calculation is very sensitive even to reasonably small dollar amount. So, I think that\u2019s one example to Mike\u2019s point we got very intense focus on productivity overall, we realized what was the number 7 million of year-to-date impact of our efficiency our main focus and that set a run rate of $42 million. So, we will continue to drive that run rate higher and the realized about higher as we go forward as well. So that\u2019s going to contribute and help support the incremental margin and then I say that debt expense is always a little bit of wildcard but we think that there could be an opportunity in that debt expense as we drive some process changes internally to focus on how effectively we collect.", "So, I think those are the things that I point to you that give us some confidence that the 60% flow through margin are flow through that we talk about is very realistic for the year.", "David Raso", "Would you \u2013 given it\u2019s -- your control for something really could just make confident if you need to can you help us a little bit more in quantify the potential benefit from the accrual on the bonus because this quarter say you need another $20 million of help year-over-year on accrual bonus to get to the 76% incremental for this quarter that\u2019s a pretty healthy jump this quarter the benefit was only six. So just give us more comfort that that is a lever that you could pull, I mean can that add not 6 in the second quarter and third quarter could it be 20s and 30s I mean, is it that significant a number?", "William Plummer", "It could be, right now if you are looking for a number I\u2019d say something in the neighborhood of just I\u2019m hesitating, I\u2019m going too far here but in the middle to upper 30s it could be.", "David Raso", "On the year-over-year benefit? Okay that\u2019s something under your control, I am sorry was that full year or per \u2013", "William Plummer", "That's full year. And it could be a little bit more depending on how the year plays out. Again that's \u2013 it depends on how the year plays out and how we do versus the target that we set for the year.", "David Raso", "Okay. Alright. Then on the rate the comment Matt about 60 bips per months get you to the I am not sure if you are quite get there but when you get close I guess more for the cadence even if we can do that there appears the rate for the second quarter would still be lower than the 29 we just printed. So I am just trying to get a sense of the cadence when do you expect quarter to show above 3, I am just making sure we \u2013 I\u2019m trying to figure out when do we make that harder decision on CapEx utilization, rate and I would think you need to make that decision probably as you said by the end of the second quarter if not maybe a little earlier. What\u2019s the cadence or rate increase this year-over-year that we should be thinking about to help think about that trigger decision on CapEx?", "Matt Flannery", "So if you do the math you will see that you don't cross the 3 \u2013 you don't get the three threshold until the second half of the year. So we understand that. We understand that the headwind that we got in Q1 compounds and has the carryover effect to our Q2 results when you look at the year-over-year and that's within our modeling and where we are expecting so you are talking towards the end of the third quarter and then moving on from there.", "David Raso", "Okay that's helpful. Okay I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "George Tong", "Hi, good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning George.", "George Tong", "I want to drill into the downside scenario. In your prior earnings calls you noted 400 million of fleet would be affected by oil and gas and then you assume you could mitigate half of that by redeploying the fleet so that's about 200 million of fleet affected and then previously you had assumed, you expected only half year impact so that worked out to be 100 million of fleet affected. 100 million of fleet assuming 60% dollar utilization gives you $60 million of revenue impact and then $60 million revenues on 60% EBITDA flow through gets you to the $36 million EBITDA downside. So it appears your prior downside 36 million assumes a half year impact and assumes you can mitigate the downside by redeploying the fleet. So given the greater part of the year has been affected by oil, does that increase the downside beyond 36 million?", "William Plummer", "Yes. That's what I was trying to call out. The fact that we\u2019ve now experienced the equivalent of $200 million decline for now it\u2019s going to be three quarters assuming it doesn't get any worse or doesn't get any better it will be three quarters of 200 of impact and one quarter at an average of zero to 200 so call it a net affect of $175 million of impact before mitigation and then the math flows through from there to that 88% or $32 million number that I gave earlier.", "But the mitigation I want to point out, the mitigation is not included in that calculation on the 80 million of fleet that came out of oil and gas and with somewhere else. We would have to do a separate calculation of the mitigation impact of that and that's why I said that I don't believe that there will be a full $32 million impact that we will experience but something less than that. And I try to range it between 18 and 36 and you probably say 18 and 32 as the realistic range. So that's how we are thinking about it this year and obviously it requires us to continue to mitigate pretty aggressively with the fleet that does come out of oil and gas and as I pointed out that's harder to do in the first part of the year in the first quarter that it is when things get busy in second and third quarters so we are encouraged by our ability to mitigate even more effectively as we go forward. Hopefully that answers if not ask again George.", "George Tong", "Yes. No, okay. That makes sense. If I look at your updated guidance range for revenues and EBITDA at the midpoint of the range EBITDA flow through works out to be 70%, you are still maintaining 60% flow through target for the full year so this addresses either EBITDA will be below the midpoint or revenues will be above the midpoint or both. Can you comment on which of these you are thinking about as you target 60% there?", "William Plummer", "Yes, this is where the range is always make life challenging. I mean what I \u2013 I don't want to go further than just the ranges that we have given and the fact that we believe that revenue and EBITDA will fall within the range given the sensitivity of the calculation the combination of those two will get you at least to the -- about 60% flow through that we expect and not going further than that George otherwise we might as well give you the whole forecast right.", "George Tong", "Thank you.", "William Plummer", "That might be happy for some of you but not for us.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi Joe.", "Joe O'Dea", "Hi. Good morning. First on just on end markets. It sounds like non-res feedback that you are getting through the market remains pretty constructive because you talk about with the 8% or so fleet growth that you have baked in on the current CapEx guide, what the underlying breakdown is on say a non-res growth that you anticipate to drive that versus the industrial growth that you anticipate within that?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I don't know that we break it down specifically in those two categories. There is two pages on our deck that parses it out by state. The forecast and industrial growth rate for 2015 is 3.3 and the non-res construction is 6.2. So it gives you a lot of detail by state within those two categories. Beside from that some of the macro things the [eye] index just came out that's another positive by the way that's 11 of the last 12 months that shows a positive trend and it seems to have build particularly in construction and industrial and it was 50.9 in January. It was 51.2 in February and in March its 53 so you continue to see that momentum that's building and that is the future leading indicator and then when you couple that with housing and the conscientious report that I mentioned those are some of the backdrops for some of the leading indicators that we are thinking about.", "Joe O'Dea", "Got it. Thank you. And then just back on rental rate given some of the details you have provided and I guess but without knowing exactly where March wound up are you able to just sort of frame what the rental rate for 2Q would be if you see the sort of typical sequential climbs through the course of the quarter?", "William Plummer", "Yes, Joe its Bill. It would be below the 29 year-over-year for the full quarter that we achieved in Q1 so I mean you can do the math. It comes to about 2.5% in the second quarter just on the sequential month the way Matt described it and that certainly reflects the strong second quarter that we had last year making for it.", "Joe O'Dea", "Great and on that I mean with the tougher comp in the high flows through I mean I know 60% is a full year target so it seems like that there is a little bit harder comp on getting that 60% incremental maybe in 2Q and it gets better into 3Q, 4Q you have better rental rate support?", "William Plummer", "You got it. It will be more challenging in the second quarter and then it gets better in the back half.", "Joe O'Dea", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And due to time constraint this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks operator and by the way I want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call.

You can access these filings on the Company\u2019s Web site at www.ur.com.

You should also note that the Company\u2019s earnings release, investor presentation and today\u2019s call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well thank you and good morning everyone and welcome. I want to thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call. I want to focus most of my comments today on the dynamics of our operating environment. I'll discuss how our industry is adjusting to the recovery and I'll talk about the non-residential construction is hitting its stride particularly in the commercial sector. And then Bill will cover the financial results followed by your questions.", "So, first look at the quarter, we turned in a solid performance with nice gains and profitability, margin and returns. Our EBITDA margin increased over 49% in the quarter and we reported earnings per share of $1.95 on an adjusted basis. And these were both second quarter records for us. Free cash flow was very strong at $432 million through June.", "Now taking in an entirety these numbers reflect the fundamental strength of our operating environment. There is clear evidence of demand for our equipment and demand is growing. However, taking individually to the underlying metrics reflection challenges in our environment. The rate and time utilization, rate came in softer than expected at 1.5% higher year-over-year and time utilization was down 150 basis points to 66.6%. Now it's important to understand what these numbers do and don\u2019t represent.", "For one thing, they do not reflect the macro weakness in demand. Now we spend a lot of time analyzing industry behavior, and we believe that rental demand in North America has multiple years of growth ahead. We also think that 2016 will be even stronger than in 2015 for our end-markets and the growth will be led by non-residential construction spending. And that\u2019s what most industry experts believe and we agree. And what the metrics point to are two dynamics that are more like micro cycles within our larger operating environment. These dynamics will run their course but right now they are not doing us any favors.", "The first issue is upstream oil and gas. Last quarter we told you this sector was a significant constraint with both a direct and knock on effect. And I've given an idea of the impact in the second quarter, if we exclude the branches with the most exposure of upstream oil and gas, time utilization was only down 30 basis points year-over-year and sequential rates were slightly positive.", "In April we said we thought this sector would continue to be a drag on numbers to at least the third quarter. So it is no surprise that we're still dealing with that challenge particularly in our pump operations. So obviously there is not much we can do about the price of oil but we are taking action. So far we have redeployed over $125 million of fleet away from the upstream oil and gas markets and will continue to use this lever where we see the opportunity for higher returns.", "The second dynamic is on the supply side, where it is more of a timing issue with our industry as a whole. Right now Rouse will tell you that there is some excess fleet in rental yards that needs to be absorbed into the marketplace. It's non-usual for our industry to add fleet in an upturn and to do so slightly in advance of the demand. In this case however the imbalance was exaggerated by the decline in upstream oil and gas. This will allow but until it happens it continues to be a drag on the rates and the utilization.", "Our own plans to invest $1.6 billion of gross CapEx this year which is $100 million less than our original projection. And while we have taken that number down it still represents plenty of growth CapEx to serve our large accounts and to expand our high margin specialty business. On the other side of CapEx management used equipment sales, the market is going strong. Used sales continue to be an important mechanism for us in fleet management.", "The second quarter our adjusted margin on new sales was a robust 50% which is an increase over last year. And given these various considerations, we're being realistic about the short-term impact on our performance. And as you saw last night, we lowered our expectations on rate to 0.5% gain. Our time utilization target is now approximately 67.5% and we've adjusted our revenue and EBITDA ranges accordingly. At the same time we expect free cash flow to remain very strong.", "I want to be clear about our sights are set higher than this outlook as they always are with any guidance we give. I think you know by now that our nature is to be hungry for more and in this case, if there's rate we're going find it. We have a lot of runway ahead of us in this cycle. Secular penetration is still in play and commercial construction is nowhere near its peak. Global insight is forecasting solid growth for the U.S. rental industry this year followed by similar increases in 2016 and 2017. And Dodge sees the construction market growing for at least the next three years.", "At the same time we're careful to maintain our Company in a strong position to handle any issues that arise. We've been building up our scale, technology, processes, our skill sets for nearly two decades, and even if the environment throws us a curve ball, we can handle it. In fact we're better equipped to handle it now than any time in our history. From our current vantage point the cycle is right on-track. We're finding that customers are bullish about their prospects and the level of activity seems to bail that out. In some cases we're hearing about project backlogs that are approaching pre-recession levels.", "And here I'll give a few snapshots from the field. In our Mid-Atlantic region where we had double-digit growth in the quarter or our nuclear power projects, roads, bridges and industrial manufacturing plants. In the Southeast we're seeing government projects start-up as well as healthcare construction and highway expansion. Florida's picked up, and customers are saying they expect a strong finish to the year with upside in the 2016. And in the Mid West where heavy rains and a labor shortage delayed some brick construction starts, we still had solid growth. And we're now seeing a range of projects get underway including a fertilizer plant, auto manufacturing and commercial buildings. That should give us momentum right through the winter.", "Now turning to our specialty segment, trench safety, power and HVAC both had stellar quarter. Trench safety revenue was up 15% year-over-year and power posted 39% growth. Our specialty segment got a boost from 10 new branches we opened in the first half of the year and we plan to open another eight before the year-end. But this segment is also generating solid growth organically. All of the 15% growth in trench in the quarter came from same-store performance and power and HVAC had 27% same-store growth.", "Now in addition to being important revenue streams in their own right, specialty rentals have a role in strengthening our key customer relationships. The larger the customers the more likely that the rental needs extends beyond the basics. And we're doing a good job of ramping up our cross-selling efforts to serve these accounts more completely. And in the process we're building loyalty that holds up on the competitive pressure.", "National accounts are a good example. And year-over-year in Q2 we grew our cross-sell revenue by almost 30% with national accounts. In the second quarter we grew our rental revenue but in the same group by more than 7%. So we're piloting a steady ship and we're being extremely disciplined about our business development efforts. And finally I want to mention our share repurchase plans. As we announced last night, we're accelerating the $750 million program we initiated last year. We now expect to complete that program before year-end. And then we'll start a new program for additional $1 billion of share repurchases. It's a sign of our confidence in our future earning power and our commitment to earning that returning value to our stockholders.", "And on closing, I want to come back to our operating environment and the many levers that we've at our disposal. We use these levers and inherent strengths of our strategy to manage our business to the best possible outcomes and in the second quarter you saw the benefit of the organic and inorganic moves we made. Our focus on operational excellence, our efficient cost structure and our ability to scale for our advantage, all of which contributed to a strong financial performance in many respects, now we continue to take decisive action where we see opportunity to build on these results and generate even higher returns.", "So with that I will ask Bill to cover the financial results, and then we'll take your questions. Over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Mike and good morning everyone, I'll try to add a little bit more color to the numbers that most of you've seen in the press release or heard in Mike's remarks. Starting with rental revenue. Rental revenue for the quarter was up 3.5% year-over-year that's $42 million of an increase. Within that increase owned equipment revenue represented a 3.7% year-over-year growth for about 37 million of that 42 million. The remaining rounded 4 million was ancillary and re-rent items which were up nicely over the prior year. Within the OER growth, rental rate the 1.5% year-over-year rental rate that we delivered in the quarter it placed to about $16 million of the 42 million year-over-year growth, the volume growth 2.8% volume growth represents about $29 million worth of rental revenue growth year-over-year.", "The replacement CapEx we sold replacement the CapEx average age of 86.9 months in the quarter inflating that over the average life of equipment that we sold resulted in about 1.9% or $20 million of rental revenue headwind in the quarter and that leaves about $12 million of mix and other impacts resulting from the strong growth in specialty and other mix effects throughout the business. So those are the key components of the $42 million year-over-year rental revenue growth. The only other point that I would emphasize is that Canadian currency effects are at place without all of those lines with the exceptional rental rate. Canadian dollar is weaker by 11% in the quarter and that result in about $15 million of headwind in the quarter compared to last year. So a significant component to the overall performance that said we still delivered the 3.5% in spite of that particular challenge.", "Moving to used equipment sales we generated $124 million of proceeds from used sales in the quarter that\u2019s down about 10% from the second quarter last year. And even thought the total revenue was down the margin performance was very good 50% adjusted margin for our used equipment sales activity that\u2019s 140 basis points better than the prior year and particularly proud about the fact that we are able to do that while still supporting the overall fleet strategy of selling the oldest fleet as I mentioned earlier just under 87 months of average age per fleet sold. Continuing to do a good job of disposing of used equipment through our retail channel, retail represented just over 60% of our sales in the quarter and that was about a percent better than this year that it represented last year. So a good used equipment result even albeit with the slight year-over-year decline.", "If we move adjusted EBITDA we delivered $706 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter that\u2019s at a margin of 49.4% both records for the second quarter for our Company. That\u2019s $43 million of improvement year-over-year and 200 basis points of greater margin from second quarter last year. The components of that $43 million improvement year-over-year are as follows. The rental rate improvement resulted in about $15 million of year-over-year EBITDA improvement. Volume is about $20 million of improvement and the ancillary that I called out earlier all of that is $4 million revenue improvement drops to an EBITDA improvement so a nice result there.", "Working against this fleet inflation resulted in about 14 million of impact at EBITDA and used sales year-over-year was about 5 million of impact at EBITDA both representing headwinds. We're also having a year-over-year bad debt expense increase. So that was a headwind of about $10 million didn\u2019t represent a problem or challenge in bad debt collections this year it shows that a comparison period last year was still strong. Last year we had a really nice collection result along with an improvement in the aging buckets of our accounts receivable that really took down our bad debt expense last year.", "Incentive compensation was one of the adjustments that we have made in order to offset some of the challenges that Mike mentioned. Our incentive comp benefited us year-over-year to the tune of about $18 million for the cash incentive compensation programs across the business. So that was an $18 million benefit and it help to offset some of the headwind I mentioned previously.", "Merit increases are always there they were about $6 million of headwind for the quarter and the remainder which is about a total of $20 million represents mix and other benefits. Of that 20 about 10 is pure mix whether it's mix from growing specialty cap class mix day week month mix all of those mix factors net out to about $10 million of benefit year-over-year. And that leaves about $10 million of all other which encompasses a wide variety of net benefit. So within that all other we had fuel cost saves with the lower price of diesel and gasoline. We had lower professional fees year-over-year lower T&E and that\u2019s where you would see the benefit of our lien and other productivity focused programs. So those are the pieces of the $43 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA and here again I'll call out the impact of currency which is scattered throughout a number of those lines when you step back and aggregate it all currency cost us in an unfavorable impact in the quarter about $7 million versus last year.", "Flow through for the quarter the top-line number was very robust 143%. But I'll remind you that does include the impacts of the incentive compensation if you adjust for that incentive comp $18 million. You get that closer down to about 83%. I'll also point out that the flow through was helped by the fact that our year-over-year used equipment sales were lower. We're selling used equipment at roughly 50% margin that\u2019s lower than our margin for the rental business, but when you take out used equipment you are actually helping the overall flow-through. If you adjust for that used equipment effect you get flow through that was down around 70% and still a nice result of 70% in any given quarters more in line with the roughly 6% that we've guided to for the full year.", "Looking at our adjusted EBITDA we delivered $1.95 of adjusted EPS for the quarter that compares to a $1.65 in the second quarter of last year. That\u2019s an 18% increase year-over-year and as I pointed out for the other measures it also includes the impact of currency. Absent currency it would have been about $0.04 higher.", "Moving to free cash flow year-to-date we have generated free cash flow of 432 million that includes $2 million merger related payments and that compares to 240 million on a comparable basis for the first six months of 2014. The driver of the increase was largely result of the year-over-year improvement in EBITDA performance as well as some benefits in other lines including a variety of other items. CapEx in the quarter was $693 million and that brings the total first six months capital spend for this year to just over $1 billion and that leads our net rental CapEx for the second quarter and first six months at $570 million and $776 million respectively.", "If we move to capital structure and liquidity as you know we took several steps to improve our capital structure in the first quarter with refinancing issues. We issued two new notes totaling about $1.8 billion and called a comparable amount of notes out of three different issues either fully or partially during the first quarter. And as I noted on the first call, the actual settlement for those transactions would happen in the second quarter and indeed in this quarter we did record a charge of approximately $121 million to cover the redemption and write-off of other amortized costs in the quarter. The details of all those transactions are in our 10-Q and I'll refer you there if you would like to see more.", "As of June 30, our total liquidity sat at $880 million and that included an ABL capacity of about $680 million along with the cash balance of right at $200 million, so we feel we are very well positioned with liquidity.", "Mike mentioned the share repurchase program but just to hit a couple of points there. We did continue to execute under the 750 current authorizations during the quarter. We bought $155 million worth of shares and that brings our total purchases against that program through June 30 up to $573 million, which leaves us with about $177 million to complete that program. Our initial target was that that program would run until about April 2016 but given our performance especially the robust cash flow performance as it's rolling in this year. We accelerated our timeline and now expect to finish that program by the end of this year.", "And as Mike also mentioned we have announced that our board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. That program will begin after we have completed the current $750 million program. We have put an 18 month timeline on execution of the billion so the 18 month clock will start once we start purchasing under this program. One thing to mention regarding our share repurchase program we do have to be mindful of limitations on restricted payment transactions that are inherent in many of our debt notes, as I'm sure most of you are familiar RP limitations are typical in these notes and typically they give you a basket which builds with net income. So as you growth net income you build up that basket. The basket gets depleted with RP transactions of which share repurchases represent one type.", "At the end of June we had roughly $400 million of available capacity for executing repurchase or other restricted payments. That 400 includes the RP basket along with the cash capacity that we have at the holding company level which is outside of the restricted payment limitations of the operating note issues. So we have plenty of room, the short and sweet as we have plenty of room to complete the $750 million program this year and to get deep into the $1 billion program as we executed over the course of the next 18 months plus.", "On ROIC, the ROIC result for the quarter was 8.9% and that was an increase of 80 basis points over last year, although down slightly from the first quarter sequentially in this year. And the decline really was a result of the way that we calculate ROIC, we use the five-point average for the IC component in the denominator and as you crossover the quarter that includes pump in that five point average versus doesn't include it, it had a slight impact on our ROIC on a sequential basis. So, certainly we continue to be on the path as the year-over-year number indicates toward improving our ROIC performance and as all of you know that is a very intense focus of our company.", "Regarding the outlook for 2015, again Mike hit most of the key components, we will just to add a little bit more color, our total revenue range is now $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, within that rental revenue will be driven by the rate and time utilization assumptions that we have revised. So, rate we now expect up about 0.5% year-over-year and really that rate assumption reflects very heavily the experience that we've had so far this year. Time utilization also reflects that experience, we now expect the full year to come in at about 67.5% and those will result in an adjusted EBITDA range of about $2.8 billion to $2.85 billion. We have reduced our capital spending plan for the year by $100 million. So, net gross capital, we now expect to stand about $1.6 billion and we think this line is -- and this changes in line with what we've been focused on very recently which is to be very disciplined around our CapEx spend.", "Free cash flow, we maintained our range there at 725 to 775 and if deliver that we expect the year to end with adjusted debt-to-EBIDTA of 2.8 times, that's slightly higher than the 2.6 times that we've shared in the past. It clearly reflects the decrease in adjusted EBITDA, but it also assumes now the accelerated completion of the $750 million share repurchase program by the end of this year. So, those were the key comments I wanted to make, I just wanted to reemphasize a couple of the points that Mike made. It is a solid quarter for us, albeit with some headwinds that were more challenging than we certainly expected.", "Upstream oil and gas, that impact will continue to work through, but it is the matter of working through it, rather than it being a major impact to the Company's longer term future. The supply dynamic across the industry is one that we're also focused on and making sure that we're focused on adjusting properly to what we see as a short term supply dynamic. And of course currency is another effect that we'll continue to play in our future coming up. But with all of that, the results that we delivered in the quarter represent what I think are really solid performance. Record revenue, record EBITDA, record EBITDA margin, record EPS, all put us in a great position for the future.", "So, with that I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions and answers, operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna, your question please.", "Tim Robinson", "This is Tim Robinson on for Ted, thanks for taking my question. First question I had was I was wondering if you could provide us with a framework for how you see the industry supply situation currently, and how you see that unfolding over the next three, six, nine, months.", "William Plummer", "So Tim I will start and please Mike and Matt chime in. I think I hit on it in my comments and Mike did as well. There's the dynamic of oil and gas is a major factor that we continue to work through, but we feel like we are making good progress in working through it. The industry as well as working through it and I think overtime they will. As long as there is not a major down leg on oil and gas drilling activity given what we've seen and we put some more information in our investor deck to share with you the trends that we've seen in oil and gas activity. We think that the impact from oil and gas is stabilizing and even if it goes down a little bit more, it's not going to be a major change from here. The supply dynamic is one that I think we're also very focused on. Some of the mid-sized and smaller players according to data that we've seen from Rouse and elsewhere have been growing their fleets in the early part of this year. What we've seen and heard more recently, let us call it over the last couple of months is that they are much more attuned to the challenges that the oil and gas dynamic have put to the industry and so people are now focused more on making more disciplined decisions we believe around their supply in the current environment. So, that's what frames our thinking that we can work through this supply excess if you will in the relatively near-term, couple that with the demand back drop that we've talked about says that we'll get through this and times should be better going ahead. I don\u2019t know if you guys want to add anything Mike or Matt.", "Matt Flannery", "No I think Bill you covered it well when Mike referred to the time utilization in the non oil and gas stores only being down 30 bps and imagine how much that they have to absorb into those end markets that they are participating in from the oil and gas this location. As well as everybody getting a little bit head on their fleet purchases and that\u2019s an encouraging sign that bolsters our opinion.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would only add one data point that I pointed to in my opening comments was Rouse and they\u2019ve got a wealth of information on this particular subject. And if Gary was here on the phone he would probably say that exactly what Bill mentioned that as we went for the seasonal side it is being absorbed and the utilization and we always see on ramp is increasing.", "Tim Robinson", "Can you just give us an update on July trends for rate and time?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure, Tim. Just the way we've characterized it is that July rate is very much in line with our expectation for the remainder of the year. The time and fleet on rent growth are a touch ahead of our expectation for the remainder of the year. And maybe I'll offer up a little bit more here. Your natural question is what is your expectation Bill? We're not going to give the exact number for the month of July, but our expectation for rate sequentially over the months remaining in this year, are flat to down slightly on each of the remaining months, so that gives any little bit better frame for the rate expectation.", "Tim Robinson", "When you think about that flat to down slightly for rate sequentially how would you compare the rate expectations for the non-oil and gas exposed places as opposed to the oil and gas branches?", "William Plummer", "I would say they would fare better as they have they\u2019ve been almost over half of point better through the second quarter and we'd expect to see that combination. And flat to down there could be some lumpiness in there but if you do the math that\u2019s needed to happen for us to reach our current guidance. And if there is more to be half out there as Mike stated we will go after and we do think the opportunity will be in the non oil and gas segments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "Seth Weber", "I want to go back to the CapEx discussion. I appreciate that the Company wants to be positioned for an improving environment, but I'm really struggling with the way that you frame the second half for rental rates and fleet utilization. I'm just struggling with why you can't bring the second half CapEx number down. Do you have line of sight that you really feel like you need the equipment for the start of next year? Given the rate and utilization outlook that we're looking at for the third and fourth quarter, I'm just trying to reconcile why you wouldn't bring the CapEx down further at least for the second half of this year. And as a tie-in to that question, you brought your long-term -- longer-term rate guidance down from 3% to 2%, and I would think that one of the ways that you could ensure that the rate stays higher is with less -- with having upward pressure on fleet utilization, so I'm just trying to tie all this together, if you could?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes and Seth this is Mike and it's a great question. And it is one that we've been debating internally here for the last few weeks. Actually I would say the last few months. Well I think we have to start let me breakdown the CapEx for you to begin with of the 1.6 billion of rental CapEx. If you take away the inflation adjusted replacement CapEx of 114 that leaves you with a growth capital of about 460 million. And this is all seen in our investor deck that we have out there. We will spend on that 460 we will spend $70 million of that this year to refurbishments for our rental assets and the investments in our GPS or telematics for the fleet. So this is surrounded and that leaves about $400 million that is split evenly between our specialty business and our gen rent business.", "Now as I mentioned our specialty is doing quite well and we're funding the 10 cold starts that we started and we've eight more to go this year that\u2019s a high margin business, high return. And it also provides an entanglement with our customer base. So now we're talking about roughly $200 million for the gen rent and we're the growth really goes into our national key account business where we've had some new wins and we're also investing in high time utilize assets. But when we think about the Investments, we don\u2019t think about it just as a point in time. We are investing in what we think is the cycle that has multiple years of growth apparatus. But I want to also point out that, you mentioned that of dropping our CapEx this year. I'll point out in the investor deck that we also dropped it coming in the next year and that\u2019s always subject to change just as the -- as we go through this year and we think about next year and we going to December and we come out to the investment community, we'll update you.", "If we think that the worse is behind us completely and there is some rational behavior is going on and we can see more, we're going post more. But that said, we're actually very comfortable on our inventor plan as far as the rates are concerned, just to address that, yeah you are right. It declined and if I recall -- when I talk about rate, people are asking me -- they use to ask me when we were coming out of the recession. Mike how do you see this? Well, used priced margins improved than you see utilization, than rate. Our rates been impacted but time utilization because of the influx or working through that as we go through the back half of this year. Now I will tell you quite honestly Seth if we have to adjust next year. We will. But I just don\u2019t think about it as a point in time, I think it is a continuum because we buy these assets after the life cycle. And it's really it comes down to a judgment call, and this is how we've debated this and this is where we came out and we're comfortable with it at that point.", "Seth Weber", "I appreciate that, Mike, but I mean when we used to talk about the business, we would talk about -- so you did almost 69% utilization last year and we used to talk about line of sight or runway to pushing that over 70%, and it just seems like with adding this fleet you're moving away from that objective and in conjunction with that the rate is coming down. So it seems like there is at a minimum an opportunity here for the second half of the year to take CapEx down and just wait and see how things progress because really nobody knows how the oil is going to play out and whatnot. So are you locked into contracts that are --this $200 million of gen rent, are those deals you can't get out of, or you really feel like you have line of sight to things getting better in the early part of next year that you need this -- or is there specific customers that are teed up for this equipment?", "Michael Kneeland", "I'll start a part of it and I will Matt to chime in, our national account represents about 40% of our total business and it's up 7% in the quarter. These are contractual long-term obligations for us. So line of sight on those is pretty long in comparison to the rest of the industry. I will ask Matt to talk about time utilization and some of the dynamics.", "Matt Flannery", "Yes sure Seth so and as Mike said that additional 200 million of the flexibility to take that away without the kind of the risk of long-term relationships and long-term revenues and accretive positive good return revenue, so that\u2019s why we came to that decision but when you parse out the gap year-over-year between was about 130 basis points and if you look at our full year guidance this year versus our full year actually this year. Half of that is a call that we made to continue our path on pump. So we've got a little over $70 million in pump assets that -- with that business being down we could monetize if we thought that was the right long-term decision. But we want a fund the additional cold start growth as well as can't really not fire sell assets that have plenty of trade left on them and will have value for us long-term as we see this other recovery for that business.", "That\u2019s an investment we made for our longer term gains. So that\u2019s half of that, 130 bps of year-over-year decline. Bill as pointed out that we moved a 125 million of assets at the oil and gas. That\u2019s only two-third to what we have to do. We have about another 60 million that we have to move out in the balance of this quarter and we have action plans, individual assets identified. When we tie those two components together, those are the best to drag that\u2019s the 1.3 year-over-year drag that we're dealing with and it's not unfortunately as simple as us saying we are not going to buy the remaining 200 million of high time assets in general business and replace some with those assets that are dragging the time down. And that\u2019s why it looks a little dislocated from afar when you dig into the detail which we've obviously done. We're comfortable with our plan.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS, your question please.", "Steven Fisher", "Just wondering how you approach the guidance on rates for the second half compared to how you approached it in April. Was there any more caution or conservatism this time, or different analytical work? Just looking for your confidence that it won't be any worse than this barring a real fall-off in oil prices?", "William Plummer", "So, Steve it is Bill we're human beings so to the question that is their more cautioned probably. Look, we had a view of rates starting the year. We had a view of rates at April and both were wrong. So we thought very deep and hard about what we expect from the remainder of this year. And that's influenced by our experience. So, how much it is harder to put a number on it, but we feel like this is a realistic view and look I mean we've set about 0.5%, could it be 0.4 or 0.3, yes, could it be 0.6 or 0.7, yes, so I think it's fair to say that our thinking was influenced by the experience and we don't want to be in a position of missing this time to be brutally honest about it.", "Steven Fisher", "And then in terms of the non-oil related business, can you parse out the 30 basis-points of lower time utilization as a function of just the reallocated oil equipment, or is it other trends within the non-res construction market, and what is your confidence that you'll start to see that utilization improving in the second half?", "William Plummer", "I think we certainly expect that the non-oil and gas parts of our business as the oil and gas dislocation continues to be absorbed should see less of a headwind going forward. How to quantify that is a tough one to respond to. Matt or Mike, would you add anything?", "Michael Kneeland", "No I would just say when you break it down market-by-market and you see that more -- half of our reasons have had sequential rate improvement in Q2 as opposed to the overall company. And nine of our 14 regions have shown year-over-year growth. We see that there are still markets that even absorbing extra capacity in the near term or performing well. And that what's gives us that confidence that we can -- we continue on the path that we re-guided to -- more importantly that '16 and '17 end market still strong for us.", "William Plummer", "I know you pointed out to it on the investor deck, which by the way we've broken it into two segments, so it's easier for people to go through. One is the financial deck and one is the background information but on Page 6 you'll see a non oil and gas locations. And you'll see greater than 20% upstream exposure the one with less than 20%. And we always see a ramp build is very similar to what the pattern you saw last year. You'll see that in the oil patch, particularly the upstream, you'll see the bifurcation of where it actually pivoted in March, and the drag it's been, but it seems that it is moderated as far as the timing. One thing we will tell you, is according to Rouse is that for the company, for the rentals, we still lead the industry in our peer group on time utilization. That being said, we don't have time, we got more to do as Mike mentioned. We got some more assets to get it clear out of here. We're going to get that done. So, this is a -- this movie hasn't played out yet, but we're focused on it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley, your question please.", "Nicole DeBlase", "I guess my question is kind of on the medium-term rate outlook. So in the slides it was already mentioned that you guys have moved from 3% to 2% and I think that the footnote says 1.8% over the next four years. But I'm just curious when you look at what you are embedding now for free cash flow in '16 and '17, which the targets came down a bit, does your 2016 free cash flow estimate assume that '16 is the year that rates turn positive and when might things wash out from an excess equipment perspective and rates could possibly turn positive year-on-year?", "William Plummer", "And Nicole it is Bill our '16 forecast does assume rates turn positive year-over-year in '16 and so the note that we've put in the investor deck about it averaging 2% thereafter reflects a positive year-over-year in '16 and then a greater positive in '17. So that's the profile that we expect. The fleet absorption issue that we're playing through right now, we've talked about it being a 2015 or perhaps early 2016 phenomena. And that's shaping our thinking about how we approach allocating fleet capital and so forth.", "Nicole DeBlase", "And my second question just shifting to EBITDA drops, so you guys talked about some of the puts and takes there but you still had 70% EBITDA drop-through minus all of the one-time-ish items this quarter, so I'm curious, I'm calculating implied drop-through of about 48% in the second half. Could this possibly be conservative? Is there something to think about there, maybe incentive comp, just curious about your thoughts there?", "Michael Kneeland", "There is nothing major and specific that we have baked in or our forecast for the second half. And so if you want to interrogate that has been conservative, I guess you could reasonably do it that way, but we don't want to get too far down the road of forecasting higher flow through unless and until we've got a better sense of where that\u2019s going to come from. And we put the best foot forward on flow through and our comments year to date and we're going to work really hard on it in the second half.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, your question please.", "Scott Schneeberger", "First one, Bill, for you, just following up on talking about the outlook for price going forward, could you speak -- thanks for the cadence of what you're going to see sequentially over the months of the back half, how is that going to flow into 2016? You mentioned a little lighter in '16 and better in '17 and beyond. Just curious at the transition at the end of the year and into the next year the rate flow-through? Thanks.", "William Plummer", "So if you're looking for statement about how the sequential in '16 will shape up we certainly have looked at that differently then we might have done have we not have the oil and gas location that we have right. So we tempered our view of how the sequentials in '16 will play out versus where we were before oil and gas. Hopefully that responsive to your question, if you got another question ask it a different way Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Kind of a follow up, trying to figure out the right way to ask it, maybe I'll come back to that. In the meantime, I'm curious, maybe Matt this might be for you. Rental rate trends by asset class. Can you give us a little bit of color of what you're seeing with regard to the equipment itself? I think it's probably intuitive with regard to pumps perhaps, but maybe stabilization and then some other things that anecdotally might be helpful to us. Thanks.", "William Plummer", "Sure Scott so when we look at two major cats some of our larger products are similar to what you'd imagine the overall company is and maybe hair better. So the aerial products the reach fork products are similar a hair better than what we're seeing is the overall company. Some of the higher return assets that are in the oil and gas whether it's some dirt product or light towers they're seeing a little pressure because of the extra capacity moving into different and moving them into different markets. So I guess the way I'd answer is the more fungible the asset the more it seems to act like the overall business and those are less fungible life comp like some of these high hour assets that have been in the oil and gas for a while where we're seeing a little more rate pressure. And these aren\u2019t huge swings but there is some delineation between the two.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Bill, if I could circle back just really quick, historically you've talked about, hey, we're ending this year, we have been running at 3%. Now hypothetical, and that's going to trickle 2% into the coming year. That is essentially what I was asking, and then what we should think about in comps this year-over-year comps in the first half, with that in mind, just to get us a -- leading into '16 and where that may start?", "William Plummer", "I do this without going through a quarter by quarter breakdown in 2016. Maybe I'll approach it this way if we finish the year the way we have in our forecast for the second half of 2015. Our carry over into 2016 will be about a quarter over point negative. So that\u2019s where we would start the year and if we got any reasonable sequential progression from that and that will start digging us out of that negative carry over position. Is that helps.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Bernan Jack", "This is Bernan Jack on behalf of Jerry. Can you give us a sense for time utilization performance for national pump in the quarter, maybe quantify the headwinds of total business?", "William Plummer", "We haven't broken out national pump utilization sort of separately. You know, as you might imagine, it is on a year-over-year basis it is down materially. But that is about as far as, you know, as we have broken it out. Matt, do you want to.", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, if you look in the industry background deck on Slide 32, you will see that we have acknowledged there has been 11% year-over-year decline in revenue in the pump business and to Bill's point we haven't pointed out time utilization but we showed that in the slide, in the deck, and that's the best that we talked about earlier, right? About our longer-term view of this business and holding those assets that have a lot of tread left on them for the longer-term gain.", "Bernan Jack", "And then second, both the dollar and time utilization increased for aerial platforms, can you provide any color on what drove that improvement or what you're seeing in that market?", "Matt Flannery", "Sure. That is the aggregate of the improvement that we have been building so a little bit of that is the momentum that we've had over, you know, the last couple of years, candidly. So that when is I had stated earlier in answer to Scott's question, that they're a hair better than what we're seeing overall in the company and when you pull out the oil and gas participation of those assets, that hair turns to be a little more significant, right? So that when is we're talking about the positive sequential rates in more than half of our regions and you have to imagine it is big a part of our fleet as aerial and reach fork are, they have to participate in that. So hopefully that answers your question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray, your question please.", "George Tong", "When you take a step back and look at the key metrics, rental rate growth slowdown/decline, time utilization reduction, CapEx reduction, those are typically classic signs of a peak in the cycle. What gives you confidence we're not at or near peak in the cycle and potentially a peak that is induced by overfleeting or oversupply?", "William Plummer", "That is a great question and so let me step back and say, if you recall, that used margins continue to be very strong. But more importantly we took a look at and if you take a look at just the U.S. economy forecasted growth in '15, '16 and '17 on real GDP it is supposed to improve. When you look at residential investment, business investment, and even the state and local investment, it is supposed to improve. Forward take a look at what Dodge has put out and we have this all broken down in our investor deck. Construction, excluding utility and gas plants, is going to be up in '15 by 9%. Projected 12% and 15% and 14% in '17, and then we even break it down by NHS where they see real construction growth by sector over the outlying years. Again all public information, all independent, and all of the primary goals, or I would say the primary business of non-res construction, which is a big catalyst for our industry, remains positive. So overtime we see that to continue to play out.", "With regards to the fleet, and I've talked about this, you know, the -- I understand the re-fleeting, I get it from all of the independents, they have been somewhat blocked out for some period of time. They won't have a endless supply of capital available to them. And I also think that with the rouse information, at least 55 participants, aside from the United Rentals, participate in this. So they have real data. They have real information by which they can help judge their business better today than ever before. And I believe that they sign up for this so that they can understand how they can drive better returns, how they can drive better cash flow, so that they don't get themselves into situations when the cycle does turn. So I don't see the cycle turning yet. I think there are still multiple years ahead of us, and we tend to agree with the experts that are out there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nic Coppola from Thompson Research Group.", "Nic Coppola", "So I don't believe you guys talked about wet weather much. Clearly places like Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado, saw a lot of rain in Q2, and so to what extent was that a drag in the quarter, any way to quantify that or speak anecdotally about it?", "Matt Flannery ", "As we obviously saw in our largest year-over-year sequential time utilization gap, so it have a drag on the overall business we have since rebounded from that, so it certainly has some impact on the first half results. But candidly we don\u2019t think that was the major reason it wasn\u2019t a specific period of time. But I think the overall dislocation of the fleet that was brought in then and faster than expected decline in a big end market of oil gas is probably have more to do with it. But May weather was certainly no helping and we did see our largest dislocation we were over 170 bits down year-over-year in the month of May and then rebound it up to 130 bits in the month of June.", "Nic Coppola", "And then last question here. Wondering if you could just talk a bit about the acquisition landscape right now and whether or not the current environment is giving you any pause.", "William Plummer", "Look we're in a very good position right now we're giving billion dollars of share repurchases in back stock holders, so this point of flexibility to do acquisitions. But I will tell you that we have a high bar and we look at these things we've cashed on a lot and some that we have been intrigued by but it's ongoing. I would just say that the rigor is out there is not going to dissipate. I think that\u2019s important for everyone to understand that this company has not change its view or its goals of where we are and where we intend to go on the returns whether it be capital whether the acquisition they all go in the same bucket acquisitions have to be on their own merit as to strategically, financially and culturally why we would do it.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thanks operator. And I do want to thank everybody for taking the time to spend with us. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to Fred, but as I stated just a moment ago, this company is going to be remain focused on executing on its plan and making sure that we focus on returns and that our goals have not changed. We are better equipped today than we\u2019ve ever have in our past. And we'll pull that leverage we need to accomplish our goal. So thank you very much and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

You can access these filings on the company's website at www.ur.com.", "Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations. You should also note that the company's earnings release, investor presentation and today\u2019s call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, thanks operator. And welcome and good afternoon everybody. I want to thank you for joining us on today's call. ", "These first quarter calls are always about the future in the past and today is no different. But I want to start with a recap of 2015 for two reasons. First, it was a solid year for us with some excellent results, and as I will discuss, it says a lot about how we're managing the business. And second, we saw some trends emerge in 2015 that are likely to impact the current year. ", "I will start with the operating environment. It offers some challenges although the underlying foundation of the recovery remain positive. We capitalized on some broad-based opportunities such as the continued rebound in commercial construction and we saw lively demand from some sectors such as hospitality, renewables and public works. At the same time we dealt with a significant drag for upstream oil and gas and its knock-on effect. A weak Canadian dollar and fleet growth in the industry, which according to Rouse is outpacing demand. ", "Nonetheless, for the full year of 2015 we delivered a record amount of adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion and a margin of 48.7%, which is the highest in our company's history. And our free cash flow came in at $919 million after CapEx which was also a record. These numbers tell a good story to show how we can be flexible and adjust our tactics while delivering value for investors. ", "So as we look to 2016, the headwinds are still with us. There are also some evident macro constraints such as pressure on industrial activity, the Canadian economy as well as some unknowns. But underneath these dynamics, the non-residential construction markets are continuing to recover. And that's a key point. ", "The equipment rental industry is continuing to grow. That\u2019s why if you asked me where we stand on our operating environment, there\u2019s really two answers to that. One has to do with the short-term, meaning 2016, and the other is longer-term relating to the rental cycle. Short-term, our stance is to be cautious on CapEx and proactive about pursuing profitable growth opportunities in areas, such as specialty services. And I will talk more about specialty in a minute. ", "For the company as a whole, we think that our 2016 revenue can range from roughly $1 million [ph] to $200 million on either side of last year's performance. And this includes a significant negative impact from FX as Bill will discuss in a moment. And it takes into consideration the continuing drag from the Canadian economy on our performance. Canada is a commodity-driven country with economic issues that go deeper than Alberta and the oilsands. Real GDP growth in Canada this year is projected to be less than 1%. And as the largest rental company in Canada, we\u2019re going to feel some pain, and it could be significant. But we\u2019ll do what we can do to mitigate the impact on rates and utilization through fleet management. ", "Now with rates, for the company overall we\u2019re projecting a year-over-year decline of 1% to 2%. We\u2019ve moved rates higher for five straight years and we\u2019ve maintained a premium price for our services, and sometimes I can make our rates more vulnerable to pressure in the short term. But rate integrity is the best long-term strategy for value creation. ", "With utilization, we\u2019re guiding to approximately 68% which would be an increase of 70 basis points. We see improvement coming from our disciplined management of CapEx and OEC rent, a continued recovery in non-residential construction spending, secular penetration and the absorption of fleet excess in the industry. ", "What our outlook doesn't show is timing and that\u2019s a big part of our 2016 plan. We\u2019re going to be very careful about the rollout of our CapEx. In the first quarter, we expect to spend less than half of the CapEx we spent in last year's first quarter. The CapEx we do spend will be focused on growth sectors and key customers. And from there we will test the waters. Full year plan is for approximately $1.2 billion of gross CapEx and we have the flexibility to move that number up or down based on the data that we see from our operations. ", "So now turning to the longer term. Beyond the current market uncertainty, we agree with the industry forecasters that there are multiple years of growth ahead for rental in North America. The latest projection from Global Insight is about 6% annual growth in construction and industrial rentals through at least 2017. And we\u2019re seeing levels of customer activity to support this view. That point can't be lost when revenue flattens out for reasons I mentioned earlier. ", "So it's important to note that our actual -- market activity is solid and in many cases trending upward. And our customers are on a whole optimistic. So I\u2019ll give you a few examples. Our Southeast region had a strong finish to the year. The activity is coming from mix of sectors, including automotive plants, infrastructure and amusement parks. ", "On the West Coast, commercial construction is going strong along with renewable. Our Pacific West region has launched some business on a number of solar projects. And more universally, we\u2019re on large multiyear construction projects in industries ranging from ag business to biotech, to hotels and to sports arenas. The real standouts continue to be our specialty services of Trench Safety and Power & HVAC. For the full year combined these services increased our rental revenue by 21% and a healthy 16% of that revenue increase came from same store. ", "We will continue to invest in fleet and coal storage for the specialty operations as well as our pump business. We\u2019ve been expanding our pump footprint in new geographies and diversifying our customer base beyond upstream oil and gas, and we expect to realize some benefits from these actions in 2016. ", "Specialty service is an important part of our game plan for value creation. But when I speak to investors one-on-one, I often caution against thinking specialty as a standalone business. It\u2019s true these are high margin operations in their own right but their greater value lies in the holistic view of the company and specifically in cross-selling. We cross-sell our specialty services to national accounts to create stickier customer relationships, compete more effectively on major contracts and earn a larger share of the wallet. ", "In 2015, we generated 22% more revenue from cross-selling versus the prior year, and we believe there\u2019s significant more financial benefit to be realized. This is just one area of the business that we\u2019re operating more effectively. In 2015 we also performed at a record safety level. We became a more technology enabled company. We\u2019re even better at change management, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in improving our rental process and service capabilities. And our employees are incredibly engaged in our company's future. All these are important attributes that matters to customers. ", "And finally, I want to make a comment about our liquidity. We generated over $900 million of free cash flow in 2015, and we do expect to create about the same or more in 2016. We plan to utilize this cash flow to buy back shares and pay down debt this year. And these are the most prudent uses of our cash at this time.", "So in closing, I want to emphasize that while 2016 contains some unknowns, we\u2019re absolutely certain about our ability to manage through any volatility. 2015 didn\u2019t always go according to our plan but it was very profitable for us. We executed on our strategy. We showed discipline as an organization. And this year we also showcased our resilience and flexibility we have in adapting to change in order to drive returns. These qualities will serve us well in 2016 when we expect to deal with some ongoing challenges. And they will serve us equally well in the longer term as we benefit from a rental cycle that has still years of growth ahead. ", "So with that, I will \u2013 shifts this over to Bill for the financial results and then after that we will take your questions. Over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone from me as well. I\u2019ll try to add some more color to the key metrics that you\u2019ve all seen, starting with the revenue picture. Rental revenue in particular \u2013 rental revenue was down 3.2% in the quarter this year versus last year, that's about $42 million of revenue decline. The pieces of that really start with re-rent and ancillary. Those two combined were little better than flat, so call it up half a million dollars, the net of those two components. The real driver in the change in the quarter was OER growth. Within that, rental rate down 1.8%, that was about a $21 million decline versus last year. ", "Our volume increased 0.2%, accounted for about $3 million of improved revenue year-over-year, that's a plus year-over-year. Inflation \u2013 CapEx inflation cost us about $19 million, little more than $19 million versus last year and then everything else, mix and all other components aggregated to a decline of about $6 million year-over-year. So those are the key pieces of that $42 million rental revenue drop in the quarter and explains the 3.2% decline from last year. ", "One other operating measure within that year-over-year rental revenue performance was time utilization, 68.2% for the quarter was down 2.4 percentage points for the quarter. I\u2019ll point out that, that does include the impact of Canadian currency translation of the fleet on rent in the volume component. ", "Speaking of Canadian currency, the impact in the quarter for the currency was very significant. Canadian dollar cost us $22 million versus where we would've been had it stayed flat. So a pretty significant impact in revenue growth for the quarter. ", "And just one real quick note on the full year rental revenue, $4.949 billion, up 2.7% last year. I'll note that that also included the impact of the currency headwind. Currency in the full year period cost us $78 million versus unchanged currency. So a very significant impact in the full year as well. In fact, if you excluded that, our growth rate would have been as high as 4.3% for full year rental revenue as opposed to the 2.7% that we reported. ", "On used equipment, we generated $157 million of used proceeds in the quarter, that\u2019s basically flat with the prior year and the adjusted gross margin came in at 46.5%. That margin is down from the prior year by about 2% but it\u2019s still very strong relative to the margin that we\u2019ve achieved in our long history. And I think that reflects the fact that we've been very focused on driving as much of our used equipment sales activity through our retail channel as we could. ", "In the quarter, retail accounted for 77% of the proceeds that we realized and that\u2019s the highest share through the retail channel that we've achieved in a number of years, probably going back to before the last downturn. So we feel good about the overall used equipment result that we drove in the quarter and in the year and look for the used equipment market to continue with robust pricing and momentum here in the near term as well. ", "On the profitability front, starting with adjusted EBITDA, it was $744 million in the quarter and came in at a margin of 40, that\u2019s a $31 million decline or 70 basis point decline in the margin. The $31 million versus last year is made up as follows. Rental rates cost us about $20 million in EBITDA whereas volume was a positive of about $2 million over last year. ", "CapEx inflation was about a $14 million reduction versus last year and that used sales margin in dollar terms cost us about $5 million versus the last year. Our usual merit increase impact of about $6 million of reduction in EBITDA came through in the quarter. And then we had the biggest positive in the quarter year over year as we\u2019ve talked about throughout the year was our reduced incentive compensation accruals, that was a benefit of about $19 million. ", "Bad debt expense was about $2 million of the headwind versus the prior year and everything else aggregated to $5 million headwind versus the prior year. So those are the key components of the $31 million of EBITDA change in the year. ", "I will also point out that spread throughout a number of those lines was the impact of currency. It all aggregated to about $8 million of headwind from currency on a year-over-year basis to bring us to that full year \u2013 excuse me -- that quarterly number. ", "For the full year, just real briefly, our adjusted EBITDA of 2.832 billion was an increase of 4.2% and that included an unfavorable currency impact of $29.3 million for the full year, so again currency was a pretty significant impact. ", "On flow-through. Adjusted EBITDA flow-through for the company finished the year at 86.4%, but I will point out that, that includes the impact of the lower incentive accruals, that was a benefit as well as the impact of the currency change year over year which actually sounds bizarre but it also was a benefit to flow-through as well just given the impact \u2013 the separate impacts on revenue and EBITDA. If you exclude both currency and incentive comp, the flow-through calculates out to 65% for the company and that's probably consistent with the roughly 60% that we guide to or guided to for 2015. ", "Moving to EPS. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.19 and that was essentially flat with the prior year. I will point out, however, that on a year-over-year basis currency was at play [ph] in the adjusted EPS number. It costs us about $0.02 in adjusted EPS. ", "We also had a significant tax law change that was finalized in the fourth quarter in the state of Connecticut. Lots of detail around that but when you net out the impact of that tax law change, it costs us about $0.06 versus last year. And then I\u2019ll also point to the mix shift between the US and Canada. Canada took a smaller share of our income in the fourth quarter and actually indeed [ph] over the full year in 2015. So if that mix shift had not happened, we would've been better by $0.02 as well in the adjusted EPS number. So keep those three things in mind as you think about the quarter EPS. ", "Same with the full year, $8.02 adjusted EPS for the full year. That was an increase of 16% last year but again that was impacted by the currency impact which in the full year was about 8% of headwind, also the Connecticut tax law change, a portion of which was accounted for in the second quarter tax rate and the remainder was finalized in the fourth quarter. So if you aggregate those impacts in the year, that was about $0.12 of headwind and then the shift in mix between US and Canada cost us about $0.13 for the full year. ", "On free cash flow, great story here in 2015. $919 million which compares to $557 million in 2014. Obviously the lower rental CapEx was a big part of the positive impact year-over-year but also the higher profitability contributed as well. ", "Our cash taxes also had an impact. They were lower cash taxes paid and favorable working capital effects were also at play during the year for that $900 million or $919 million of free cash flow. ", "Rental CapEx, as you\u2019ve seen already, gross rental CapEx reduced in the quarter by $109 million and that brought the full year total to $1.534 billion, somewhat below $1.6 billion that we've been guiding to, and that rental CapEx was about a $1 billion number for the full year. ", "On the liquidity front. $1.1 billion of liquidity at the end of the quarter. That included ABL capacity of just over $870 million, and cash on the balance sheet of about $180 million there. So we\u2019re well-positioned on liquidity as we typically are. ", "Just a quick note on our share repurchase programs. We completed during the quarter the $750 million repurchase program that we were operating under previously. We bought out the remaining $10 million of that program in the quarter, and then we also began purchases under the new $1 billion authorization and, in fact, completed $111 million against that authorization during the quarter as well. So a total of $122 million of repurchases in the quarter and it put us on the path to executing the new $1 billion program over the course of the next 18 months. We started it in November of last year and so we expect to complete it by the end of April in 2017. ", "As I pointed out in prior quarter we do need to be mindful as we execute the program of our limitations on share repurchases, in particular, the restricted payment limitations in our debt covenants. However when you aggregate those RFP baskets available to us plus the available cash that\u2019s held at the holding company, we have about $500 million worth of available capacity at the end of December in order to execute share repurchases. So we feel that we\u2019re well-positioned to be able to manage the program on a prudent timely basis as we go through the year. ", "Return on invested capital in the year, just to touch that real briefly, was 8.8%, and that number was essentially flat compared to 2014. ", "Let me finish just by addressing our outlook really briefly. You\u2019ve all seen the numbers that we put out. I\u2019d just point out that as Michael mentioned, we have a somewhat wider range around the midpoint of our guidance for revenue, EBITDA and indeed, we\u2019ve instituted a range for our view on rental rates. That wider range represents truly our view of the uncertainty that we\u2019re managing through right here now. And we put the wider range there to give us a little bit more flexibility in responding to whatever the environment hands to as we go throughout 2016. In particular, the range on rental rate, the minus 1% rental rate, top end of that range reflects our carryover \u2013 our carryover from 2015 is essentially 1%. And so as we go through 2016 in order to achieve the 1% decline, the top end of the range would require us to have some slight increases during the peak season on a monthly sequential basis, which we think is a reasonable -- reasonable outlook. To get to the 2% would require essentially flat monthly sequentials during the peak season.", "The time realization improvements 70 basis points is also we believe very reasonable given the approach that we\u2019re taking to our management of the CapEx spend. $1.2 billion of gross capital, netting down to about $700 million after used proceeds, we think again is a great way for us to approach the environment that we\u2019re managing through right now. If we do that, that will net out to that $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow that you see in our guidance, very very comfortably. ", "So those are the key things that I wanted to offer as prepared comments before I open the \u2013 ask the operator to open the call for Q&A. I\u2019ll just reiterate some of the comments that Michael made. Caution and flexibility are two of the key watchwords as we think about 2016 and we\u2019re going to make sure that we continue to evaluate the environment very carefully and make decisions about what to do in response in a very prudent way. I think you can count on that and certainly look forward to talking all of you as we go forward throughout the year in managing the business.", "So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.", "Nicole DeBlase ", "So I am going to ask question about free cash flow allocation. So I think you guys said that you have $500 million available from the buyback -- for the buyback into \u201916, but generating $900 million to $1 billion of free cash flow. I am just curious about the potential for debt paydown, what you guys are looking at for \u201816?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure, Nicole. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re thinking any free cash flow in excess of the share repurchase program that we\u2019ve talked about will go to debt paydown. So we\u2019ve still got the view that the share repurchase program we want to execute over the 18 month period, that averages out to something like $165 million a quarter or so. And that would eat up about $700 million of free cash flow if we did it on that pace. So the remainder of the free cash flow we would use to pay down debt, that is our baseline view of the best use of the cash flow given our outlook for the market and the opportunities that are in front of us.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI Group.", "David Raso ", "My question relates to the free cash flow beyond 2016, just we all can have our own views of the length of the cycle. But just thinking about your maintenance CapEx levels, it appears the 2016 CapEx is getting down toward maintenance levels already and then we have cash taxes going up in \u201817 as well. So can you help us a little bit with that lever that we usually have to pull or things do go awry economically in \u201817 or \u201918, you usually have a pretty good lever on pulling the CapEx down. So given we\u2019re already down in maintenance levels, can you just walk us through where we could see CapEx get cut beyond \u201916 in case the need arises? I am just trying to understand the dynamics there.", "William Plummer", "So maybe I will start and Mike and Matt, you guys can chime in. The maintenance level for maintaining fleet size and age is probably in that 1.1 billion kind of area these days. And so that certainly is one view of maintenance and one view of where we could go to if things are softening up. But I would argue that there is no need to replace the units that we have, if our view became that we truly were headed for a downturn. And so I would argue that we could be even more aggressive than that and be a sub a billion in total CapEx if a downturn started to develop. So how far below a billion, I think we\u2019d have to -- we have to discuss that in more depth before we gave an answer to that. But could we carve another couple hundred, 300 million out of the $1.2 billion that we\u2019re spending this year? Yes, I think so. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey David, I would just say that $200 million of that growth capital is really going to or the growth capital we have is going to our specialty business. So if things were to turn south as you described we would obviously pair that back and as Bill mentioned, it's not unusual for us to ratchet back given the maintenance CapEx going forward if we had to. ", "David Raso ", "And I know it's relatively early in a quarter. But can you give us a bit of an update \u2013 if you said that earlier, I apologize, I missed it. But how the year started when it comes to sequential trends, I mean, usually January is not a strong great month, but just given the way the year ended, how are rates trending sequentially and year-over-year relative to the full year guidance?", "William Plummer", "So we won't characterize it with a number but I'd say that that rates are trending as we expected. By the way I\u2019d say the same thing for OEC on rent in the early part of the year here, even including the impact of the currency. OEC on rent is trending at what we expected and that's consistent with the rates ending up in the range of guidance that we\u2019ve given. So that\u2019s as far as we will go on that one right here now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.", "Ted Grace ", "Bill, maybe as a follow-on to that last comment today. I was wondering if we could just decompose kind of rate dynamics, in the fourth quarter and broadly on \u201815 and then relate them to expectations on \u201916. Just wondering if we can talk about rate in Canada versus the US, talk about rates in kind of more heavily exposed energy markets versus non -- and then construction versus industrial, just so we can get a sense for what that interplay was last year and how we should think about those dynamics in the current year?", "William Plummer", "During -- guys help me out. I will start here. And so regards how rates finished out the \u201915, I think it's fair to characterize it as they finished weaker than we expected. We\u2019ve given the sequential months there at minus 10 basis points for October, minus 50 November and minus 50 in December as well. And remember, we\u2019ve told you that we expected seasonal to maybe slightly -- seasonal declines in that fourth quarter, right? I think it came a little weaker than what we thought. And Canada was certainly a part of that. As a result, the carryover that we brought into \u201816 starts at a lower point and we\u2019re watching very carefully how rates develop from here. And to our point earlier, that's going to be the watchword for the entire year. ", "Canada, I don\u2019t know if you guys want to handle the Canada notion but Canada did have a fairly sharp decline in the fourth quarter \u2013 sharper than we expected when we talked to you at the third quarter call, and we\u2019re watching that very carefully and thinking very very aggressively about what do we do in response, right? What are the drivers? Is it something that we can address and if not, what can we do in response? So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about Canada and honestly thinking about the whole business as we come early end of the year. Matt, Michael, you guys want to add anything?", "Matt Flannery", "No, Ted, I think Bill captured it well. I would just say -- if the team up in Western Canada is really fighting it hard, specifically in Alberta and they\u2019re continuing to take the actions necessary to adjust their fleet appropriately and they cannot run the macro environment there and we\u2019re going to adjust appropriately and now we\u2019ll get some growth capital to the lower 48. ", "Ted Grace ", "Maybe ask a little differently, rates being down 180 basis points in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a dispersion like \u2013 on a relative basis that \u2013 what did Canada do versus, call it, Texas in the Gulf Coast, the stronger reasons like West and the South. I think what people are really trying to understand is if you look at down 10, down 50, down 50, as the monthly progression, how broad-based was that the sequential degradations?", "Matt Flannery", "Ted, I think you could say it was spotty and you could imagine the places where they had more challenges. So if you think of the relative rate we've enjoyed in the past, Western Canada and anywhere where we\u2019re doing shale drilling was the highest relative rate. So in markets where that was dramatically impacted mostly in Western Canada than any other single end market, you saw large rate decline. So we saw rate declines in Western Canada in Q4 of over 6%. So that would be the highest that you would see. But as you can imagine losing your highest rate business in Texas or in North Dakota or in Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, right, up in the Marcellus Shale, those were the ones that has a bigger decline and then you had positives in markets on the coast where non-res was really carrying the ball for us and they were able to do well on some of the projects, Mike referenced in his opening remarks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.", "Brandon Jaffe", "Hey good afternoon. This is actually Brandon Jaffe on behalf of Jerry. Can you please provide some commentary on what you're seeing out of your industrial customers? Are you seeing any difference in activity from refiners, manufacturers or chemicals companies?", "Matt Flannery", "So Brandon, this is Matt. I think that we\u2019re still seeing growth and solid steady business from our chemical and also in our downstream oil and gas customers. But we\u2019re also seeing pressure from those that have a more significant holdings in any kind of exploratory or upstream oil. So I think that's predictable but when you look at -- what we count in our industry, you have to recall in our industrial and other we also put in our infrastructure. And we see some growth opportunities there. We see some growth opportunities in manufacturing and then above all of that, I know you specifically asked about industrial but we continue to see growth opportunities in non-res. So you'll see Global Insight say the industrial has got 5% growth opportunity and you'll see reports that we\u2019re in an industrial recession. I would say we\u2019re experiencing somewhere in the middle of that pack and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in our business and what we\u2019re hearing from our customers.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, I would only add that if you take a look at our investor deck, it has industrial outlook for the US and outlook for Canada, and it\u2019s really a story of two different worlds. But they\u2019re going to grow. And it\u2019s not so much capital projects, it\u2019s also maintenance and so that\u2019s why they go through spending and look how the industrial is forecasted for 2016. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research.", "Joe O'Dea ", "I'm just trying to understand a little bit more in terms of how things unfolded over the quarter. I think as of a quarter ago, you were anticipating a quarter of a point to a third of a point of carryover headwind and now that\u2019s a full point, in terms of the experience you\u2019ve had with customers, I mean you talked about no surprise where the weak areas are. But was it really just a function of customers coming back and pushing for those price concessions, or was it more a matter of increased competition that whereas we had expected a lot of fleet would've been moved but still excess supply, and you still see that competition pushing rates down?", "Matt Flannery", "Joe, this is Matt. I would say that the concession part of the equation happened earlier in the year mostly in upstream and Western Canada, there are not really any concessions out of that side. But I think the growth opportunity from an OEC on rent perspective tempered any kind of rate improvement that we would get and we certainly had to partner up and defend some strong relationships here and there on national account base. But I wouldn't point to it as a concession driven situation. The fact of the one point carryover is really a function of what Bill stated what Q4 sequentials look like. When you have 0.5 negative in both November and December that made the full year carryover of a full point negative. So when you look at our range of 1 to 2 we\u2019d have to be flat for the full year of \u201816 to achieve that one and that\u2019s where we\u2019re driving towards, and if there is more there, we will take whatever opportunities we can get. And Mike said it earlier that rate discipline is a key lever for the industry as well as for us.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would only add two things. One, which is -- in the fourth quarter is where we saw a significant drop off in Canada that impacted our carryover as well. That\u2019s number one. Number two, to answer your question, at last year we talked about the supply and demand imbalance and with oil -- and then as the fleet additions coming in, it\u2019s not unusual to see some pricing pressure. And as we went through the fourth and first quarter, I\u2019ve always told a lot of investors that, this will be the challenge, this is the challenge that we have, simply because we don\u2019t have oil like we've had over the last five years. So it\u2019s more seasonal trend, more non-res trend and what gives me a lot of comfort is I am seeing the trend where the absorption is coming through in the fourth quarter, with Rouse and some of the data points they had. And the other one is the declines we\u2019re seeing in OEMs on their book of business tells me that we think this is a prudent decision-making. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC.", "Seth Weber ", "I just want to follow up on a couple earlier questions. I think the first one on the potential levers to pull. I think you guys \u2013 you\u2019ve got $40 million or $50 million through your efficiency program so far. I mean are there actual measures that you can take from a cost-cutting perspective other than cutting fleet, I mean branch closures -- any other, more on the expense initiative side that you guys have considered. I didn\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t really heard any talk about that so far.", "William Plummer", "Sure, Seth. We certainly are looking at opportunities to help address any shortfall should it develop as we go through the year. We have taken some actions. You saw in the quarter that we took a restructuring charge in the quarter as we restructured some of our organizations in the last couple of months. We are looking for other opportunities that might make sense should the environment deteriorate from where we are. Those actions come across a wide variety of our operations. And so we\u2019ve got our usual lean initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years now, and those initiatives really resulted in a run rate of savings at the end of the year of about $53 million. We still are targeting getting that run rate up to $200 million by the end of this year. So there are lots of other actions that we\u2019re going to continue to look at. Right here and now we don't have a notion of branch closures. Right here now we don\u2019t have a notion of large headcount reductions but those are questions that we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate as we go forward. And we think that\u2019s the prudent way to get at it. In the meantime there are some specific things that we are already doing that we think we can double down on to help drive that run rate of cost saves higher and help realize some of those cost saves in the current year. ", "So those are the things that we\u2019re focused on right here now. We continue to evaluate to see whatever actions we might need to add to the list that we already have. ", "Michael Kneeland", "The other thing I would add to that is \u2013 this is a very seasoned team and we have done this before, if need be, we\u2019ve got the experience -- not only through economic downturns but also in achieving synergies when your \u2013 during your mergers. So I have high respect for the team and what they are capable of doing. And as Bill mentioned, we\u2019re not thinking about it now but we are more than capable of making adjustments as they come. ", "Seth Weber ", "And then just circling back on the oil discussion, can you update us on what you think your direct oil exposure is today and whether you're still \u2013 whether you think you need to continue to move fleet around, I think you had a target of $200 million for 2015. Is there an estimate for 2016 or do you feel like that we\u2019re kind of near the bottom on the oil and gas, the weakness, you\u2019re starting to anniversary that soon?", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, Seth, this is Matt. So we had talked about at the end of the third quarter as far as fleet movement that we were down to about 30 million, 35 million of seasonal items and we pointed the heat and light towers and I would say other than the heat, be in a little bit light we still may have another 10 million, 12 million of excess heat right now in the oil and gas that we haven\u2019t repositioned because the demand hasn\u2019t been there. We\u2019re pretty much through the oil and gas movement. The exposure now in the upstream is down to 4%, down from 6% a year and a half ago when we started tracking this. So our exposure is certainly less and if we end up getting a little bit more of a dip than where the baseline is today, I don't -- certainly don't think it's anything that we\u2019d have to call out in large fleet movement, it would be like any other end market that ebbs and flows that we had to move fleet out.", "Michael Kneeland", "The other thing I would add to that is the fact that, look, we expect continued weakness in oil and gas, particularly in the upstream. And more importantly Canada -- my opening comments I think the issues there will likely persist with a very meek GDP growth that we\u2019re going to have for 2016. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.", "Steven Fisher ", "It sounds like you guys are still pretty committed to buying back stock these levels, which I understand simply because stock is down \u2013 do you still believe you\u2019d ever get opportunity ahead of you but if how are you weighing the possibility to reduce debt as the cycle moves. I guess, as a follow on, what would you have to see in order to start being more being aggressive and in paying down debt.", "William Plummer", "So we are as I said my prepared comments we are still on the pace that we talked about for the share repurchase and we think that that's appropriate given our baseline view that says that the cycle still has room to run. We believe there will be growth in construction in 2016. We believe that there is likely growth in construction in 2017 and on that basis, we think that the cash flow is going to remain robust and we can still execute that share repurchase to pay down some debt and end up in a better place. What would have to be true in order to change that point of you is I think we would have to come with different conclusion about how long the cycle has to run. I realized that there is a reasonable position that says, hey, Bill \u201816 and \u201817 are not looking good right now, so you should change your view right now. We haven't gotten to that point. ", "The good news is that we\u2019ve got the capability, we\u2019re executing the program on a steady pace over time. Now we\u2019ve got capability to pull it back if we do change our view based on the experience that we have in the marketplace. If the first several months of the year come in weaker than we expect right now, then we\u2019re going to have to rethink that approach to the share repurchase and debt-paydown. And that's how we\u2019re approaching it right. This is part of the notion of flexibility, we set up a point of view. We established a plan based on that point of view but then we keep our head on a swivel as they say and keep asking ourselves: is it still right? Is it still right? And at the point where we can convince ourselves that it's not, then it\u2019s time to something different and that might include paying down more debt and buying back less share. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, I would just add that, capital allocation for us is very important, it\u2019s also ore discussion that we have quite frequently. And those write, how we see the world, I guess the point I would make is we\u2019re approaching the world and this year cautiously, with our capital, with our CapEx and we will kind of see how things unfold and we will make adjustments and changes if need be. But right here and now we spend -- we frequently spend -- of these either monthly or at least once a quarter with the various of industry experts. Scott with the Global Insight, McGraw Hill and other industry experts to try to gauge the marketplace and try to understand what they see. And that forms our decision -- as part of our decision process. ", "Steven Fisher ", "So it sounds like, just to paraphrase that, you believe that debt reduction is really the downturn tool and capital discipline is really your up-cycle tool for not for letting the debt get too far, the levers can go out of control, is that the way to sort of paraphrase it?", "William Plummer", "Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. Obviously the capital control and the cash flow it drives links to the amount of cash flow that's available for debt reduction or share repurchase. And we have to manage and balance all of that as we go forward. And I think it\u2019s a high-class problem to have to be able to say, oh, we\u2019re buying back shares and we\u2019re paying down some debt. But maybe the mix isn\u2019t right. It's great to be in a position where you can do both and that's the approach that we\u2019ve been taking, and we\u2019ve been talking to you about for a number of years. So that\u2019s a great position to be in. Now we\u2019ve just got to come to a view about what\u2019s the right mix. We have a view that says 700 \u2013 250, to use the midpoint of the cash flow -- is the view that we want to manage to right here now. So let's go forward and see if anything comes along to convince that, that's not the right view.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. ", "Robert Wertheimer ", "If I can do a two for \u2013 is there any flexibility to move fleet from Canada to the US, or you just under spend if that market sort of semi-structurally declines? And then second, just to ask a question, maybe there are bunch of us a little more bluntly. Have you been able to benchmark more on a branch by branch basis against major competitors to see if you have any competitive issues versus just mix issues that you\u2019ve been talking about for a long time on rate and utilization?", "Matt Flannery", "Thanks, Robert. This is Matt. So we are absolutely going to move fleet out of Canada. The first lever that we pull as we discussed before is to sell any excess fleet, that\u2019s outside of its real useful life and we\u2019re being very aggressive doing that as we speak right now here in the first quarter. The next lever would be to go through our normal retail channels and target, and maybe it\u2019d be some special values and to move some of that fleet. And then the third value -- lever would be to move it and there\u2019s some more complexity about moving it out of Canada than there would be if it was internal but not enough that we can't get over through most of our assets. I think the first two levers are going to be enough to adjust the fleet to where it needs to be but if we have to go further we are capable of doing it. And we absolutely are doing it today. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Your question around what kind of metrics and add down to the granular level of a branch on where we stand amongst our peers is something that we utilize routes for, it\u2019s not by branch, it\u2019s by market. It\u2019s a rearview mirror of 90 days but it is a useful tool that we use to help judge us in our process. We didn't have that years ago, it's relatively new, it represents about 40% of the market or somewhere around there, and we pushed that down, all the way down to the district level, which is kind of how they measure our markets. ", "Robert Wertheimer ", "And the outcome \u2013 I mean you feel confident, you talked about it, I understand that, at a high level. You feel confident that you are in a district level, let's say, or regional level that it's more mix than competitive slippage? Well, I know you're saying it better than [mass] overall. I get that. I guess I'm just thinking of larger competitors. ", "Michael Kneeland", "It only measures you against your peer group. It doesn\u2019t give you specific people. And so it\u2019s a very general tool of measurement and it\u2019s the best measurement we have because we all report electronically \u2013 the electronic feeds nightly to the Rouse report. So look, on balance, we are doing very well. Is there opportunities? Absolutely. And those are things that we pick up on, that helps the way in which we manage to become a better company. So that's why we subscribe to it and we use it \u2013 we\u2019re actually utilizing it as a tool. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.", "Scott Schneeberger ", "Hey, guys, good afternoon. I'm going to go little bit off here and a question on rent versus buy. On your three biggest general rent categories aerial, earthmoving and reach forks, where would you say we are in the rent versus buy percentage? And then also, if you would address it in your specialty category as well? ", "Michael Kneeland", "That\u2019s a loaded question but I would tell you that from an aerial perspective I would \u2013 Matt, correct me, it\u2019s probably in the high 90s goes through the rental channel. There is not a real distribution network to speak of. With regards to earthmoving, I think it's probably and there\u2019s reports out there, so I may get a little bit wrong but it\u2019s somewhere either 50:50 or 60:40 or one way or the other. But earthmoving is predominantly still owned, as in comparison to a lot of the rental assets. ", "With regards to our specialty, think of specialty as not just the product, it\u2019s really the solution. We\u2019re trying to solve problems whether it be pump, how much fluid, what kind of distance, what type of fluid, what\u2019s the velocity do you need and how often does it need to be recurring, singles for power, there's various sizes, and then also with HVAC whether it\u2019s industrial cooling or whether it's something that you're doing for just air-conditioning. Each one is more of a solution than it is just the asset. ", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, I think Mike hit it very well. Trench, would add with trench -- the only one he didn\u2019t touch on would be we really got secular penetration against non-compliance which is a great end market sell-in to grow that pie. So I agree wholeheartedly. ", "William Plummer", "Scott, I interpret -- I heard your question as being what the guys answered. But I also heard your question as being \u2013 has the rent versus buy decision dynamic changed in any fundamental way? And my view would be no, it hasn\u2019t. There is still I think a pretty powerful argument for rental versus purchase across all of those cat classes that you mentioned. And we believe that that's going to continue to be the case going forward. ", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, and on that point, the OEMs we\u2019re seeing their distribution network add more to their rental fleet. So rentals become more of a viable channel. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And due to time constraints, our next question is our final question from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Ross Gilardi ", "Thanks, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Michael, I just want to ask you, I mean your number one competitor seems pretty insistent out there publicly that things are great in the rental space and that nothing is even remotely changed outside of the oil and gas space. They are clearly taking a much different stance on capital spending than United Rentals and I'm just wondering, is that one of the reasons why the pricing environment still hasn't really firmed up, or is the pressure on rate coming from elsewhere? And how willing are you to cede market share to them if they continue to keep their foot on the accelerator? ", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, look, everyone's got different strategies. So we have ours about value creation and that's what we\u2019re going to stick to. I have mentioned about the fleet imbalance, that\u2019s the data that comes out of Rouse in comparison to the growth of the industry. We can peek in different markets as well and we have more of an industrial non-construction related than others. We also have a more geographic footprint, like I mentioned in Canada which also has an impact. And so I think that each one has their own strategy but the industry has its own challenges and I can only speak to what we\u2019re going to do and how we\u2019re going to approach it. ", "Ross Gilardi ", "But in terms of the pricing pressure that is out there, do you think it's -- is it coming from Sunbelt or is it coming from the smaller players who are the ones that are really saddled with more of the over capacity right now? ", "Matt Flannery", "Ross, this is Matt. I won\u2019t speak individually to any one competitor but because we don't have visibility to what their baseline is and what their price levels are. But all I would say is when you look at the Rouse data which is industry average, so let\u2019s say just looking at 6% or 7% of the market, looking at a third to 40% of the market, it\u2019s very clear that there was too much fleet early on, time utilization was impacted and you can make the inference that that impacts rate growth in each individual market. ", "As far as the smaller regional players, if you are in some of the markets where we\u2019re seeing great growth on the coast, I am sure we have small regional players that are seeing great growth as well. So it's really spotty as far as where you are on the map. And I think that's why you will hear different versions of what people are enjoying.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Great. Well thank you all for coming and joining us.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the safe harbor statement contained in the company's earnings release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC.

You should also note that company's earnings release, investor presentation and today's call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks Operator. Welcome and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.", "As you saw last night, our first quarter results were shaped by a market that is fundamentally positive while presenting some notable constraints. And we delivered $584 million of adjusted EBITDA on $1.3 billion of revenue, with lower rental rates partially offset by higher volumes.", "It was a solid performance, particularly in light of the challenges of oil and gas in Canada. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $627 million, and we're on track for free cash flow in the range of $900 million to $1 billion this year, in line with our outlook.", "But behind the scenes, our results showed some encouraging momentum. While utilization was down 10 basis points for the quarter versus the prior year, it was up year-over-year, both February and March, driven by increase in OEC-on-rent. The utilization in March increased by 100 basis points.", "Taken in total, these numbers reflect a good quarter. The obvious disappointment was rate, and that's a major focus for us. In fact, we believe that we can improve our rate management in this year's operating environment even though there is still some uncertainty out there.", "I'll start by summarizing what we know, then what we don't know about 2016. We know that the cycle appears to be intact; volumes continue to be strong across a majority of our businesses. Secular penetration is still a tailwind and demand from non-residential construction is on the rise. We also know that our industry added a lot of fleet last year. The new fleet, combined with equipment coming out of Canada in the oil patch has created an oversupply in U.S. markets in the short-term. However, our services are still earning premium pricing. Strategically, this is the right positioning for us in the long-term.", "Canada was the major constraint. The drag from our Canadian business was significant in the quarter. It accounted for almost a full point of rate decline, and we're managing through it by reducing fleet in weak markets, particularly in Western provinces.", "So, we're pleased to see that the Canadian Government is taking steps to turn the economy around. And importantly for us, the current plan includes an investment of more than $120 billion in Canadian infrastructure over 10 years, with $11 billion to be allocated immediately.", "So, let's talk about what we don't know. We don't know when supply and demand will achieve equilibrium, no single rental company controls that timing, but we do believe the market is moving in that direction. Independent data indicates that the growth in supply is now tracking below the growth in demand.", "Rouse reports that their absorption ratio hit an inflection point in March of last year. The timing makes sense when you think about the decline in oil and gas. Then, the negative ratio hit bottom in November and has been improving ever since. Last month, the ratio was close to parity, and it's the best we've seen in a year. If rental companies continue to show discipline with CapEx in 2016, excess fleet will be absorbed more quickly by the growth in demand.", "Oil and gas is another question mark, and there's plenty of speculation, but no certainty about the future of this sector. We don't think upstream vertical has hit bottom, yet. And finally, a change in the relative strength of the American dollar would affect the results we report from Canada, and that's a challenge to predict.", "So, it's been a series of puts and takes. But when you analyze all the various dynamics, it comes down to the size of market growth and the cycle is still very much on track. And in our view, it will be several years before it reaches its peak. It's also the consensus of industry analysts that supports that view, as well as our customers'.", "Nevertheless, our experience tells us that pricing will be very difficult to predict in the short term. And while rate is just one component of our outlook, it underlies some of our other metrics. Consequently, we made some adjustments to our guidance, as Bill will discuss in a moment.", "Before I move on, I want to emphasize that our focus continues to be on managing our business for significant long-term value. And as a leader in our industry, we're not willing to be a bystander. We're taking every measure to ensure that we generate the highest possible returns on our capital over time, and that includes managing rates more effectively.", "We're also being very diligent about taking cost out of the business. Our lean initiative is on track to reach an annual run rate of $100 million in savings by year-end, and we're committed to that target; and we see more room for improvement next year.", "Now, let's talk about CapEx. In the first quarter, our capital spend was down by two-thirds versus last year, and it gives us major flexibility in managing the balance of our CapEx spend in 2016. Last night, we reaffirmed our $1.2 billion CapEx target for the full year and this is based on the substantial demand that we're seeing in many of our end markets.", "So, here is a quick snapshot of the quarter. Non-residential construction in U.S. increased year-over-year by more than 11% through February, which is the latest data available. It drove up equipment rentals across a wide range of verticals. We saw year-over-year revenue increases in some of our largest end markets, such as infrastructure, chemicals and refining. And we generated double-digit growth from verticals that are important targets for us. These include pharmaceuticals, entertainment and disaster recovery.", "Our specialty rental operations are continuing to turn in strong performance. Rental revenues were up 8.7% year-over-year for specialty, with same-store growth being more than 6%. And the combined rental revenues from Trench Safety and Power & HVAC, our two largest specialty businesses, increased by 12% year-over-year, again largely on same-store basis.", "With our pump business, we're continuing to diversify our market base, both in terms of verticals and geographies. In the first quarter, we opened cold starts for pump in Tennessee and Minnesota. Specialty is an area of our business that we're funding for growth again in 2016.", "We have a lot of investor interest in these operations. So, I want to take this opportunity to invite you to a branch visit on May 5 in Tampa. We're taking investors to a co-located trench, pump and power branch starting at noon. It's a good opportunity to spend some time in the field with several of our key leaders, including Paul McDonnell, who runs our specialty business. Space is limited, so please give us a call this week if you're interested in attending.", "So, in summary (9:04) and realistic about 2016. We've looked at this year from every angle and the prospects for equipment rental in North America appear strong, demand is building and our fleet on rent is keeping pace.", "And our focus continues to be on many aspects of our business that are within our control. These include asset management, our cost structure and cash generation. And you'll see us flex all these areas as conditions warrant, while strategically we'll stay the course in a year to offer significant opportunities to deliver for our shareholders.", "So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill, who will go over the results with you. So, Bill, over to you.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, I'll add some color to the numbers that you've already seen or heard from Mike just now.", "Starting with rental revenue, $1.117 billion of rental revenue in the quarter, that was down 0.07% or $8 million year-over-year and the components are as follows: re-rent and ancillary revenues netted out to an increase year-over-year of $2 million, ancillary was up a little bit more, up $4 million, offset by re-rent coming down slightly.", "Within owned equipment revenue, the decrease totaled about $10 million, with rate accounting for about $28 million of decline, on that 2.8% year-over-year rate decline that we reported. And that was almost exactly offset by volume being up pretty strongly, $28 million of volume contribution on the 2.7% increase in OEC on rent that we reported.", "Netting against that is the replacement CapEx inflation for the quarter, that was about $20 million of year-over-year decline, reflecting about 2% impact from the inflation of the CapEx that we replaced. Mix and other was a solid positive contributor this quarter, plus $10 million versus last year. And that very largely reflects the fact that there was an extra day in the reporting period this year. So, net all that together was $10 million of decline in OER as I said, and that totals the $8 million of decline that we saw overall.", "Within that revenue decline, I'll point out that we did have an impact from the Canadian dollar. It's weaker this year by about $10 million worth of rental impact. So, if you excluded that Canadian dollar currency impact, we actually would have reported an increase in our rental revenue of 0.3%.", "While I am on Canada, I'd also point it out that that's just the Canadian dollar impact. If you just look at the U.S.-only performance in rental revenue, our U.S.-only rental revenue was actually up 3% in the quarter, that's up 3% when you exclude Canada.", "Time utilization performance in the quarter actually trended very nicely as you went through each month. The overall quarter, as you saw, was down 10 basis points, but within that, we had a decline in January of about 150 basis points and then February, the utilization flipped to a positive 30 basis points, on its way to the 100 basis point year-over-year improvement that we reported in the earnings release. So, we're on a pretty good positive trend in utilization in the quarter.", "Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $115 million of proceeds from used this quarter, was essentially flat with last year. The margin of 48.7% was down just over 2 basis points and that's primarily driven by some of the discounting that we've done to move volume in the quarter at a little bit higher pace than we might otherwise have done.", "When you look at the margin overall, 48.7% adjusted gross margin is still a very high level of margin in absolute terms versus where margins have been historically.", "Within that used equipment sales result, we sold about 60% of our revenue through the retail channel, consistent with where we were in the first quarter and consistent with what we've been trying to do to focus much of our sales effort through the retail channel. So, a solid used result in the quarter to get us started for the year.", "On profitability, just real briefly on adjusted EBITDA, $584 million, was down $18 million or 3% versus last year and the margin was 44.6%, that was down 120 basis points. The key components, that rate impact that we called out earlier, cost us about $27 million compared to last year, but that was offset by the volume impact, which was a positive $18 million in the quarter.", "Fleet inflation was a headwind of about $12 million, so the net effect of all those was really driven by the rate result and inflation. The ancillary revenue impact that I pointed out earlier was a benefit of about $2 million in the quarter. That offsets the used equipment sales result, which was a negative $2 million in the quarter compared to last year.", "And then we had our normal merit increase impact of about $6 million in the quarter, and the mix in other benefit primarily driven by that extra day was a positive $9 million in the quarter. So, all of that nets to the $18 million year-over-year decline that we called out.", "Sprinkled throughout that decline was about $3 million worth of headwind from the impact of currency that occurs in various lines here. So, that $3 million was reflecting that $10 million decline in revenues that I talked about from currency.", "Briefly on adjusted EPS, we delivered $1.40 of EPS in the quarter, and that was $0.06 better than last year. And again, that overcame the impact of Canadian currency, which was about $0.02 headwind compared to last year in the quarter. So, a solid EPS result for us during the quarter as well.", "On free cash flow, good quarter there, $627 million in the first quarter, that's up $177 million versus last year. The key drivers there, obviously the lower CapEx spend in the quarter was a benefit of about $223 million year-over-year. We also had lower interest expense of about $20 million. And offsetting those two benefits, were really timing of working capital that cost us about $67 million versus last year. And obviously, the adjusted EBITDA result, decline of $18 million. So, those are the key components of that $177 million improvement.", "I would caution against running too far with the overall results of $627 million in the quarter, as you think about the full year free cash flow. The timing in some of the subsequent quarters will weigh that down. Still we expect to deliver between $900 million and $1 billion worth of free cash flow over the full year.", "On rental CapEx, you saw the $100 million in the quarter, down to $123 million versus last year and that's consistent with the approach that we've taken to rental CapEx this year, which was to give ourselves as much flexibility as we can early in the year, and then decide, as we go through the year, where it's appropriate to spend. So, we still are expecting to spend $1.2 billion across the entire year for rental CapEx, the quarters will vary this year as we respond to demand.", "On liquidity, real briefly, we finished the quarter at $1.4 billion of liquidity, just over $1.4 billion, and that reflected about $1.2 billion in ABL capacity and another $200 million in cash on the balance sheet.", "Let me just touch on the share repurchase program briefly. We purchased in the quarter $153 million worth of shares, that resulted in about 2.7 million shares coming back to us and if you look at the entire current authorization, the $1 billion authorization we're operating under, we spent about $264 million through the end of the quarter against that program.", "So, we're on the pace that we talked about. As we think about the share repurchase program, our intention right now is to continue the way that we've said. Steady purchases toward about $675 million or so worth of repurchases this year, and they will be fairly steady throughout the months.", "I've mentioned before, the restricted payments limitations that we have to make sure we operate within from our debt covenants. As we finished the quarter, we had about $566 million worth of available capacity, either from RP baskets in the debt or from cash capacity at the holding company, so we're very well-positioned to continue the share repurchase program without concern about those limitations slowing us down.", "ROIC for the quarter was 8.7%. That was down 30 basis points from the prior year and clearly reflects the impact of the weaker rate environment after netting out the somewhat stronger demand environment and higher utilization.", "Let me finish up with just a real brief comment on the updated outlook. You saw the numbers with total revenues coming down to a range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA coming down to a range of $2.650 billion to $2.750 billion. Essentially we adjusted both ranges down to reflect the renewed outlook on rate. It's impact is about $100 million, and so at mid-point, it was about $100 million. So, that was the motivation for revising those components of the guidance downward.", "Our new view of rate is now for a decline of 3% to 4% over the course of the year, and really that reflects the experience that we've had early in the year. We can talk about the sequential rate performance that we had in the first three months of the year, but it's fair to say that those came in weaker than we expected and the new rate guidance for the full year essentially reflects that decline.", "Our utilization is going the other way; we've had a stronger start to the year on utilization and on fleet on rent. And so, we now expect our utilization for the year to be up about 100 basis points. That will bring us centered around 68.3% for the full year.", "No change to the CapEx plan, as we've mentioned before. $1.2 billion is still the gross spend that we're targeting, which should net down to about $700 million after used sales proceeds. And again, no change to the free cash flow outlook, between $900 million and $1 billion.", "Final comment is just regards to April. We've got a lot of questions about how April has started, so we figured we'd offer up just a little bit more thought about that. On the rate front, it's fair to say that April has started slightly better than what we saw sequentially in March. We'd call April, so far month-to-date, it's something like a sequential minus five-tenths (21:04). On utilization, it's also slightly better than where we finished out. As of yesterday, our utilization against last year was up 130 basis points.", "So, we think it's important to understand how the early part of the year plays out. And as we think about the remainder of the year, we're optimistic; optimistic about our ability to put fleet on rent, about our ability to start realizing rate more effectively than we have. And as always, we're going to drive as hard as we can toward all of those objectives.", "So with that, I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions and answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Steven.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Bill, I know you said the rate outlook for the rest of the year reflects the beginning of the year trend, but I think you are assuming sequential monthly declines for the balance of the year. So, maybe just give us a little more context for why it makes sense to assume that the rates are going to decline sequentially for the rest of the year as they did last year. Just because \u2013 we are seeing oil prices rising and the over fleeting may be moderating, as you're talking about, and the volumes are good. Can you just kind of give us a little more color there? Thanks.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, I'll start out and please chime in Mike and Matt. The rate range that we give, actually, if we achieve the 3%, you would have some positives in the back half of the year on a reasonable profile of where sequentials would go. So, it's not like we're saying, there's going to be declines every month in the remainder of the year. And in fact, if we repeated last year's sequential performance from May on, that puts us right about the mid-point of the down 3% to 4% range that we gave. And there were some flat months in last year's sequential decline.", "So, we're not here saying that there are going to be sequential declines every month going forward. We're saying that we want to make sure that we understand how our business looks if you don't get a significant turnaround in the short-term. The reality is we did start weaker than we thought in the first quarter, and things don't turn around instantly. And so, we're trying to allow room for things to take a little bit longer to turn around, but we certainly believe that that's a possibility and that's why we put the range the way we did.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And how are you thinking about the trade-off between rates versus volume utilization? I mean, to what extent are you making a conscious decision this year in favor of volumes versus rates, and any sense of how you think your market share has trended this year?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Steve. This is Matt. I would say that the two are connected, but the strategy of trying to drive both rate improvement and time improvement has not changed. Our time utilization doing better than we had originally thought was mostly due to demand and even overcoming some of the headwinds that Mike talked to in his prepared comments in Canada in oil and gas. We have some real strong end markets. I'd say 70% of our regions \u2013 and those are the ones that aren't touched by oil and gas and you could think about it geographically as on the coast \u2013 have robust demand. And that's what we're taking advantage of.", "As far as, what's that balance between rate? That's more of a supply dynamic. And we added a slide, on slide five of our investor deck, where you start to see where the absorption of the fleet coming in has been over the past year and where we're starting to see some improvement there. And that informs the stronger end of our range of 3% rate. That's what we're driving towards and we believe the supply side will work its way through because there is such robust demand.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The other thing I would add to that is \u2013 this is Mike, by the way, I would just add that, in my opening comments, we still maintain a premium. So, we're not sacrificing. The market is the market. This is the first year in, what, five years that we haven't had \u2013 the industry has had oil as the backdrop, and we understood that. And we also are looking at ways in which we can drive efficiencies in our fleet and our CapEx spend. So, we took CapEx down as well in Q1. So, we wanted to see demand. We're seeing demand, and that's what gives us a lot of comfort for the cycle still playing out.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "So, just to be clear, in these markets where you are seeing the volumes that you're not seeing just excessive amounts of competitive pressure?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, if you think about our rates, Steve, and you separate out the U.S. and Canada, we're not where we wanted to be in the U.S. Our rates in the U.S. are down 2% for the quarter versus the 2.8%, and that's driven by \u2013 in the tougher markets where there's not demand, where there's not time utilization in Canada, our rates are down 9.7%. So that's really where the big drag is. If you took oil and gas out of the number, large oil and gas, our rates would have only declined 1.6%.", "If we had numbers like that holistically, we wouldn't have re-guided rate. We would have overcome that. We would have felt like, with our rate management systems and the robustness of the focus, we wouldn't have had to re-guide. But when you put the whole experience in, we just thought it was appropriate to give that guidance, I just want to reiterate: we're driving towards the better end of that guidance and even beyond. This is not a statement of a lack of focus; it's more a statement of realizing what we experienced in Q1.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, George.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you provide further detail on what's changed in the Canadian and oil and gas markets over the past 90 days that prompted you to lower your revenue and EBITDA guidance?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, George, maybe I'll start and ask Matt and Mike to chime in. I think it's just a continuation of what we saw late last year, right. Remember in the fourth quarter we talked about Canada being down significantly. I can't even remember the exact percentage decline in revenue, but those factors that continue, right. We continued to have adjustments in the oil sands projects, and the western part being a major driver there, continue to have pressure on some of the commodity pricing that affects other industries elsewhere within Canada. And that's being exacerbated by all the fleet looking for a home and moving around in that marketplace. So, I don't know Matt or Mike, you guys point anything else specific that might have changed in the last three months.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. I wouldn't put it just to Canada. As Bill had talked about in his comments, if you carry through what the rate build was planned to be in the year, which had our initial guidance and you carry that through the balance of the year, that's why the revenue guidance dropped. It wasn't just specifically Canada and I think we spoke about that in detail.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Thanks. I'll jump back in queue.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, George.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC", "On slide five, when you show supply/demand dynamics and we've seen the improvement over the last couple of months, the rate seems to contemplate that you still have pressure through most of the year when you compare to last year in sequential declines. So, why as we see that supply/demand improving is there not the potential that things accelerate a little bit more quickly, why do you think that even as that improves and you find balance you continue to face rate pressure?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, this is Mike. It's the unknown. We know the snapshot of where we are today. We know what we're spending and how we're spending. We've taken down our capital spend significantly. It's what I don't know is going to happen for the rest of the industry, and what they intend to do and spend.", "So, it is projected, as you stated, according to Rouse that it looks like some time at the end of the second quarter, you could expect some sort of equilibrium. Now, I can't control what the rest of the industry does. I can only speak to United Rentals. But, it gives me \u2013 what I've seen it so far and what I hear from OEMs, it gives me confidence that our market \u2013 and we're marching in the right direction. That's the unknown. And is there opportunity? Yeah, that's why if I look at the 3% to 4%, there's some opportunity for some positives. But, we have to call it as we see it, and put it up, and kind of de-risk it a little bit.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. And I would add, Joe, I think, it's just how quickly can we change the momentum, right? And that's probably what we're after. The good news, as Bill pointed out, April, we started to see an improvement in momentum, and how quickly that plays through, we'll see where we get to reaching our goal of 3%.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then on the U.S. only, and rate down about 2%, and obviously commodity-related pressure, but outside of that, are there any pockets that you're able to identify, whether it's on the national account front or whether it's the walk-in business, where you're seeing a little bit more of the contribution of downward pressure on rate there.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think, we've seen pressure in different category \u2013 excuse me \u2013 different customer segments. I think that reflects the overall dynamics of what's going on in the marketplace right now, right. It's an excess of fleet, and that fleet is going to look for a home, and whether it finds a home with a large national or a mid-sized regional or a mom \u2013 a small walk-in oriented market, I don't think it discriminates.", "So, we've seen pressure in a variety of different areas. I think, the key for us is to make sure that we support our strategy, right, which is make sure that we're embracing those large national accounts, is the core part of our strategy. And then continuing to offer the services that justify the mid-sized and the smaller players coming to us as well, and to do all that at a price point that reflects the premium service that we offer. So, I don't know again, that Mike, I'll ask if you guys want to add anything, but I'd say, I wouldn't point out any particular group of customers or project types that represent the price, the pressure on rate. But that's another way of saying that we've seen some pressure in a variety of different areas.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question, please.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So, the question is on Canada, and obviously it's tough there, and probably particularly in the west with the oil and such. And I'm wondering if you can speak at all to either the competitive balance or the speed at which you can reduce fleet and normalize. I don't know whether it's more consolidated and therefore you can kind of get things in line faster, just when you anticipate given the plans you have up there, even if the market continuous to be soft that you've taken enough fleet that we can sort of stabilize a bit?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Robert, this is Matt. I think, you're hitting on something where the real challenge markets are pretty dense. And when you're thinking about Western Canada and more specifically Alberta, we've been very aggressive in moving fleet out of there. And that's been able to help us right size our business, and we're seeing, it's broad-based in Western Canada. We're seeing our competitors face with the same challenges. It's a macro issue and not a performance issue with our team or a market share issue. It's really just a macro issues in Western Canada. I want to separate out Eastern Canada because I think they might even have some opportunities in some of the provinces in Eastern Canada. It's just not robust enough to call out, but because it's concentrated in certain areas, we are able to move the fleet profitably.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. I'll follow-up again offline. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Seth.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning,", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So, sticking in Canada, not surprisingly, I guess what's struck me is \u2013 thanks Matt, for the 9. \u2013 I think you said down 9.7%, that was good data, and I think, you \u2013 in the fourth quarter, it was down 6%. I guess, what I think people are trying to figure out is when do these comps start to anniversary, because it seems like there's been a lag here relative to the inflection in oil last year. So, I think what everybody is trying to calibrate is, when do the Canada comps specifically get easier? And then also maybe can you talk about \u2013 is this all just direct energy exposure or you're also seeing indirect knock on type project activity slowdown in those markets as well?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Seth, I'll start. I think, we saw Canada declining really throughout the year last year, but the acceleration really was most pronounced in Q4. And so, in that sense the comps really started to get easier in Q4 although they will be gradually getting easier as we go through the year. Matt, I don't know if you want to answer the question about concentration in oil and gas and \u2013 or is it more broad based?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think, most of us realize, right, so it's a very highly driven by natural resources, the whole country quite frankly, and I think, it was just exacerbated in Western Canada, but it's something that as Bill pointed out was really driven in Q4 and Q1 this year, and during that period, we pulled over $70 million of fleet out of Western Canada. So, we've been very aggressive in dealing with it, and I think, I would leave it at that. I mean, it's \u2013 it'd be hard for me to parse out knock on versus the racks, I think, the whole economy, and if you're in Alberta, almost the whole economy is somewhat oil and gas related, and that's where we've seen the biggest drop.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Seth. The only thing I would add is if you take a look at one of our investors' deck, the industrial outlook for Canada by province, I think, is a good way of looking at it, and it's not just oil and gas, it is minerals and metals that are all wrapped in there. You know as well as I do Canada is reliant on commodities, natural resources, with the Western taking the biggest part of that, particularly in the oil. And you see that highlighted in our deck by province, reduction outlook on industrial spend that they see in Canada, offset by growth both on the east and the west, far east and far west.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. I mean, just to frame it though for the \u2013 I think, 9.7% down in the first quarter, would you expect second quarter to be in that same kind of range or does it that \u2013 does that start to get less negative here in the second quarter?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "If I \u2013 so, we haven't proven to be great forecasting it, to be frank. But I would say that we're expecting our improvements to come in the U.S. and that's where we think the opportunity is, that's where the greater demand is, and where we expect to get our rate of growth.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right. But I'm just talking about it on a relative basis, I mean, okay. Maybe if I could slide another one. Just on the CapEx, Bill, second quarter last year was, I think, close to $700 million gross CapEx, is that...", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "...order of magnitude, should we haircut that by 20%, 25% kind of number, consistent with your full year, or how should \u2013 is there any kind of help you can give us for just to calibrate that?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Sure. So, the intent is to respond to demand, and that's going to drive the number, so that's why we hesitate to give you a more specific guide. What I would say is we could spend as much as we did last year. If the demand continues to hold, and if we can land the fleet from OEMs. But we could spend materially less than last year, and I know that's not terribly helpful, but it could be \u2013 in the area of $600 million, it could be in the area of $700 million, just depending on how the demand plays out as we go through the quarter.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. I'll get back in queue. Thanks, guys.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Seth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI Group. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, David.", "Operator", "You might have your phone on mute.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "I'm sorry. Yeah. Sorry about that. I appreciate you taking the question. I know it's looking out to next year, there's a lot of movement in oil and gas that could change things and so forth, but on your slide 18, just trying to think about the midpoint of your CapEx is basically net CapEx goes up 27%, 28%. And when I think about the way you're laying out the rest of the year, you actually exit the fourth quarter with rental rates down over 3%. But in that slide you're saying you think there'll be modest rate growth. So, I'm just trying to think through, if I'm going to raise CapEx that much in 2017, I'm exiting 2016 with a lot of negative carryover on rate. Obviously, I guess, the answer could be you're just that bullish on 2017. I'm just trying to think through how that makes sense to start the year that negative on rate, you're going to raise net CapEx mid-point by 28%, and we think the full year rate in 2017 is going to be positive.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Hey, David, so, there are a lot of assumptions in there. What I'd say is the \u2013 regards the exit rate from 2016 or the carryover into 2017, if you want to use the midpoint of our current rate guidance, right, down 3% to 4%. If we finish the year at the same pace as last year on the sequential, right, that approximately 3.5% set of sequentials, the carryover for 2017 in that scenario would be something like a point negative, right? So, we look at that and we say that's not insurmountable to overcome during the course of 2017 and get back to positive rate throughout the course of next year. So, that's how we think about sort of what we'd have to overcome in order to get to a modest rate increase next year.", "As for the CapEx, we gave a range, right? We said it could be $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion, I think it was. And we're using that as a statement that we're going to be very focused on preserving flexibility and responding to the market more so than just saying, hey, we're going to spend $1 billion \u2013 it was $1.6 billion at the top end of that range. We're going to spend $1.6 billion right here and now in 2017, come hell or high water, right. So, we're going to be responsive. We're going to be very mindful of how rates do behave as we finish up 2016, and that'll inform our thought about what rates are going to look like in 2017 and inform our thoughts about what CapEx plan should be as a result.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Yeah. I was just trying to think through what some of your suppliers may \u2013 if you face that decision today, do you err on, I want to get that rate positive and I'll back away from the CapEx growth? I know the CapEx, though, is going more specialty than general rent, but I'm just trying to understand \u2013 is the focus still on we want to push rate? And obviously, last night's report made some people question, is it about trying to play a little catch up on some volume growth and market share recapture or \u2013 no, it's just the dynamics of this year and next year. Of those two, you would err on: we'll pull the CapEx down to make sure we get the rate.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, David, this is Mike. We haven't changed our stripes. We took CapEx down this year. And the easiest thing I could do is just throw CapEx in. To your point, our growth CapEx is going to specialty. As we go through the year, it depends how it plays out, is how I think \u2013 how we think about it. We don't know. We're giving ourselves the flexibility, but we haven't changed our strategy or our story as far as how we're thinking about it. This is \u2013 we're not going to throw out CapEx for the sake of volume.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "I think \u2013 thought it was interesting that the rate breakdown that \u2013 even if you pull out large oil, and I assume that was large oil out of U.S. and Canada, that the rate was still down 160 bps. Was \u2013 is that \u2013 I mean, in a way is that almost more the surprise, that the rate degradation in non-oil and gas areas?", "I mean, it's just a little more \u2013 I know there is a hangover in the whole oil and gas contagion, equipment moving to other parts of the country. So, it's interesting that rate even outside of oil and gas is down when the utilization \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong. The utilization's probably stronger outside of oil and gas. I'm just trying to marry that up so I understand the kind of core gen rent business outside of oil and gas.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "David, as I had said earlier \u2013 it's Matt \u2013 it's the supply side. And we saw that mid-year last year, and you saw it in all the Rouse data. There is just more fleets that came in that didn't get absorbed. And if it ended 2015 that way, then we knew there was a first half of the year dynamic, just because of seasonality, where it was going to put more challenge on it. So, I would say that it was less \u2013 we didn't have an expectation that rates in the U.S were going to be positive in the low season Q1. And I think Canada has just really, really surprised us even more so. But this is the supply-side dynamic we've been speaking about for the last few quarters.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Well, that's what I'm trying to understand. I mean, obviously we all try to figure out the supply-demand balance. But when you think most iron gets delivered now, all right, April, May, June \u2013 I mean, obviously, your CapEx in particular is heavily second quarter. So the idea of forecasting fleet versus demand, I mean, we haven't really seen the real fleeting up this year, right; seasonally, it's still to come. And when you spend time with dealers, it doesn't seem like the rental CapEx is even going down this year versus last year, which would still be fleet growth. So, I'm just trying to understand \u2013 it's not your data. Maybe it's not a fair question to you, but...", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "I mean, the fleet, to measure it in March and say, hey, we're near balance \u2013 I mean, you haven't taken delivery, yet, right? Most of the delivery comes the next three months or four months. I mean, there's still a supply-demand question that naturally isn't really answered until June-July, right? So, I'm just trying to understand how much are we embracing that forecast when we don't really know what's being shipped, yet; but it seems like the dealers aren't really backing off much right now on year-over-year CapEx. I mean, you're doing a good job cutting. I'm just trying to understand, how could I make that forecast off of March fleet when all the fleet comes in the next three months?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "David, we can't \u2013 we obviously can't comment on sort of the dealers and what's going on there, but what I would say is, you're right. The fleet tends to come now, but so does the demand. And what we're taking as encouragement is that the relationship between growth in fleet and growth in demand seems to be one that's near or heading toward balance. And you couple that with the pain that the industry has suffered overall regards an excess of fleet, right, low utilizations over the last \u2013 well, since oil broke, really. We think that there is a very reasonable case to say that the industry will continue, even though they're bringing in more fleet, bringing in less fleet, than demand might otherwise warrant and that will help with absorption. So, that's the mindset that we're bringing to it, time will tell, whether it's right or not, that's why the uncertainty is, why we're being very flexible and how we approach spending capital this year, right, but based on...", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Yeah. I'm sorry. One last thing on the positive side, I'll try to catch up though. On the positive side, I think, Matt, maybe in particular you've answered this, but all of you, there's no more need to move any iron around, would you say? I mean, you've \u2013 hopefully, you're past that point. You feel like Canada seemed like these last three months getting some stuff back to the suppliers and so forth on buybacks and stuff. I mean, where Canada \u2013 I know, the rate is down, and obviously, Matt, you're weren't willing to say rates are getting much better year-over-year, when you said the U.S. has improvement, but are we at least comfortable with where the iron generally is right now, like are we past that point?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, we believe so, and I think that's a fair depiction of where we are and we're going to be moving a lot of fleet around as we always do. But I think the big moves of having to move major blocks out of any geography, I think, we've swallowed that pill.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "That's good to hear. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question, please.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "I wanted to ask more about the demand in that industrial non-construction segment of the market. And so, looking at the slide deck, you've got a 2.2% forecast in 2016 in the U.S., clearly oil and gas is down, but can you talk more about what you're seeing in manufacturing and petrochemicals, refineries and the like? So, anymore color on trends, and kind of where you're seeing Greenfields there?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'm sorry, last part of your question, I didn't catch, Nick.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Just trends in the industrial segment of the U.S.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, I think that's obviously the one decline or \u2013 but really one of the few declining verticals we've, we've talked about ad nauseam, which is specifically upstream oil and gas. We've actually seen some improvement in certain markets in refining. We've seen great improvements in chemical and infrastructure. And, I think additionally, and Mike \u2013 I think, it was Mike referred to it in his opening comments, we have some targeted vertical efforts, admittedly in some smaller verticals like entertainment and restorations, where we've been \u2013 we've been very encouraged by what we're seeing through those efforts and that's a strategy change that we're going to invest in and continue to implement as an organization. So, I think that \u2013 there is a plenty of robust end markets, both vertically and geographically that we feel comfortable with the level of capital being able to be deployed profitability.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The other thing I would only add to that is, there's still some revamping of some automotive plants that are underway, and will probably play out for the balance of this year and to next year.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then can you give us an update on pump solutions, so what performance looked like there? And any kind of update on your ability to cross-sell and put that equipment into sectors other than oil and gas that you talked about?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Nick, pump is tracking fairly well for us in terms of coming in relative to what we had planned for the full year. In the first quarter rental revenue was basically flat and that's where we had our mindsets coming into the year. We're having pretty good success in looking at verticals outside of oil and gas and driving the cross-sellers we talked about for some time here. So, we're feeling good about pump relative to the forecast that we had for the full year.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, this is Mike. I would only add that, in those numbers, upstream oil and gas is down about 70% on a year-over-year basis, with revenues they're relatively flat. So, we've been diversifying our portfolio very nicely and we still see increases in opportunities in the cross-sell.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "All right. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Jerry.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Michael, can you talk about, as we get out within the next, call it, three months to four months based on the performance that you folks are at it (51:51) for utilization mid-April and applying normal seasonality. You'd be pretty close to your utilization high by the third quarter and I'm just wondering what is it that's making you folks a little bit shy about getting more aggressive on pricing as you hopefully get utilization to those levels? Is it a situation where you feel like you're that far ahead of the industry in terms of the utilization difference where you want to see the rest of the industry catch up or has it just been a tough environment, you want to make sure the demand is there before you start to push pricing? Can you just calibrate us on how you're thinking about that?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Jerry. I think it's important to recognize that \u2013 obviously we don't control pricing in the marketplace. We respond to a significant extent, but at higher levels of utilization, we have more room to select those rental transactions that are most appealing from rate, and it gives people some confidence in being able to quote rates that are a little bit higher. So, that dynamic we expect to play out as the year goes on, and that's why we're encouraged by our ability to improve our rate realization.", "When it gets to absolute sequential increases, it will depend on things that are outside of our control, including the overall level of industry fleet, and the level of utilization of that fleet in the industry, that's why we spend so much time talking about how industry fleet is being absorbed. You used the word confidence, it's a matter of confidence to say that you are going to start moving sequential rate higher several months down the road.", "Our experience recently has made us to be mindful of getting too aggressive and far out ahead of where the market actually is. And so that's why we put the rate forecast out there that we did. The key for us is to make sure that our management processes are focused on realizing as much rate as we can in the marketplace. And if we do that and if the industry absorbs more of the fleet that's out there and avoids bringing in a lot of excess fleet to compound the problem from here, then the rate we realize is going to be better than what we got in that guidance range. But it's hard to put that down in black and white in a forecast as we sit right here.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Jerry, the only thing I would add to that is, what lessons learned last year has made us a better company. We have a lot more rigor and control around our fleet and our capital. And we've made significant improvements in our process. That gives me comfort, number one. If you were to ask me, okay, hey, Mike what were you thinking when you gave us guidance in January, given the numbers that we posted there. I would tell you that we go through and the team goes through a rigorous process to figure out what has to occur, what has to be true on rates and utilizations.", "And as Bill mentioned, they're moving targets in one direction or one aspect to the other. So, in January, our plan called for being down 0.3%, we actually finished 0.4%. So, tenth of a point, not bad, but it really was in February and February is always a swing month for us and then it was really \u2013 it leans on March. And then, as March played out, that's when we \u2013 as we've talked about that the whole got bigger, but the demand was picking up and we started seeing that demand and you see that in the numbers that we've talked about.", "So, it's a balancing act, we think, we can improve on that, that's our goal, that's our job and we'll continue to focus on it as we go through the year and report out to the best of our ability how we see the world playing out.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate the color. And historically, RSC, before you acquired the business had a high proportion of its contracts expiring at around calendar yearend. Has that changed at all and what are the implications for rate next year if those contracts re-price at lower rates exiting 2016 than where we were exiting 2015?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Jerry, it's Matt. So, most national account contracts get negotiated somewhere around yearend, either a month or so before or a month or so after, it depends on the length of negotiation. We're not seeing \u2013 so, we've renegotiated just about all of our national account agreements for this year already and we're not seeing really any significant different performance than the overall markets that they work in.", "So, the Canadian national accounts are maybe faring a little bit better than the overall market, but in the U.S., our national accounts are behaving like the rest of our business. And, usually that's the way it's been throughout the last few years, both pre and post acquisition. So we don't foresee any difference.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I appreciate it. Thanks everyone.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jerry.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks operator. But before we end this call, I want to mention that Ted Grace has joined our team as Head of Investor Relations. I think many of you know Ted from his work as the analyst covering the industrial and construction sectors. Ted and Fred will be working closely together in the coming months. So please feel to reach out to them in Stamford anytime.", "And then going back to my opening comments, we have this specialty tour that's set up from May 5. We hope to see many of you there. And please reach out to Fred as soon as possible. But I look forward to showcasing the capabilities of our specialty branches that we are very proud of. So thank you for joining us and hope to see you in Tampa. Thanks. Bye.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

(Broker)", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the United Rentals Second Quarter Investor Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.

Please refer to the back of the company's earnings release and Investor Presentation, to see the reconciliation from each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. My. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'll begin my comments with our second quarter performance because it's a good reflection of our current operating environment. The market conditions are in our favor especially in the United States and I'll talk about some of the initiatives we have underway to capitalize on the growth in demand. And then Bill will cover our results in detail and then, we'll spend the rest of the call on Q&A.", "So, I'll start with some of the highlights from our results. While total revenue was close to flat year-over-year, our earnings were up. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.06 per diluted share compared to $1.95 a year ago. We generated $679 million of adjusted EBITDA at a margin of 47.8%. And, it was another strong quarter for free cash flow.", "Now, looking at the underlying metrics, time utilization increased 90 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%, which was good, but a little softer than we expected. And, we drove a 3% increase in volume, and which was partially offset by 2.4% decrease in rental rates. It was a solid second quarter performance and it shows that we were taking a balanced approach to managing the business.", "I want to spend a few minutes on rates, because I know it's a point of interest. Our second quarter rates were better than anticipated. We still expect full year rate erosion, but we now believe it may not be as deep as 4%, but more likely scenario is in the 2% to 3% range.", "It's always difficult to forecast rate. So, it's gratifying that we drove sequential rate improvements of 0.5-point or better in both May and in June. In fact, May was our first sequential increase in 16 months. This comes from intense focus on rates, coupled with a deep dive into the data. We're analyzing transactions that fall outside of our rate criteria, and we've had some success in turning that around. Furthermore, the improvement was widespread. In June, for example, all of our regions took rates higher from May.", "Now, I remind you of something I've said many times. Rates, utilization, volume and CapEx need to work together to generate returns. And when rates go up, utilization can be impacted and vice-versa. There's always a give-and-take between the metrics. And we also said recently that we felt we could do better on rates, and in the second quarter, we did.", "Now, turning to our operating conditions, from what we see in here, the cycle is intact. We made that statement on our last call and we believe it still holds true. Conditions remain challenging in Canada, but activity is strong in many areas of our core U.S. markets. We believe the demand that we're seeing goes beyond seasonality, and that shows that we're still in up-cycle, with an added benefit with secular penetration.", "Regionally, customer activity is robust on both the East Coast and West Coast. The Northeast has a large number of multiyear construction projects underway. Massachusetts is a good example, we're on two casino projects and a railcar facility. And work began in the second quarter and should ramp up in the coming months. In our Southeast region, rental revenue was up 12%, led by South Carolina and Florida. These two states have increases of over 20%. On the West Coast, commercial activity is stable to up in nearly every market. The technology and entertainment sectors are driving the bulk of the commercial activity right now, and infrastructure spending is strong. And nationally, our customer surveys show that optimism is still on the rise.", "A number of key market indicators line up with our position. These include the ABI, which is at 52.6 in June, followed by another strong showing in May. The ABI has now been above 50 for five straight months and non-residential construction was up more than 7% year-over-year through May. Private non-res, which is our largest end-market, was up 9.2% and contractors are reporting sizable backlogs of project work, and in some case is stretching out more than a year. The bigger backlogs are with larger contractors where we have a competitive advantage.", "Specialty rentals continue to be another factor in our favor. In the second quarter, our rental revenue from specialty segment was up 8.4% in total. And within that, our Power & HVAC business was up 15.7% and our Trench business was up 14.9%. The Power and Trench increases were almost entirely due to same-store growth. Another one of our specialty operations, pump solutions, was down 5% due to the headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Excluding that sector, rental revenue from our pump was up 21%. So, we're having good success at cross-selling our pump fleet to our current existing customer base with our gen rent customers and those who use our other specialty surfaces that we offer. In the first six months of 2016, cross-selling revenue from pump increased by almost 14% over the prior year.", "Now of course, not everything is ideal, industrial production is lackluster. Several of our industrial markets have been challenged by weak commodity prices and the impact of the strong U.S dollar on exports. And the Rouse data that came out last week suggests that in the U.S. the supply of fleet in our industry is still growing faster than demand. Much of that imbalance is driven by heavy dirt equipment, which makes up a small percentage of our fleet. Nevertheless, we would obviously like to see the industry return to equilibrium.", "In our own business we're being very disciplined with CapEx management. For the first six months of 2016, we invested $722 million of gross rental CapEx compared to over $1 billion in 2015 for the same period. And we're making good on our promise at the start of the year and deploying our CapEx in a more measured pace. This gives us greater flexibility in the back half of the year.", "We're always mindful of the potential for macro volatility. The financial markets got a taste of that recently with the Brexit vote. The economy in Canada remains weak, and globally, there is a sense of economic uncertainty. We're not seeing any backlash in our markets from macro, but if it comes to that, we'd be well prepared to manage through it. The companies that navigate the macro best are the ones that can pivot quickly and we've shown that we're very good at that.", "In addition, our customer base is much more diversified than it was 10 years ago. We have a better balance between construction and industrial business, and a broader vertical strategy that limits our reliance on any one end-market. We've also diversified our specialty range and expanded these operations. This has accelerated our cross-selling, which leverages our broader base. And for the second quarter, rental revenue from cross-selling, companywide, was up 14%.", "I also want to mention an announcement that will be coming out in the next few days, about the expansion of our digital customer service platform. The launch of a true e-commerce capability will give us more ways to connect with customers and engage in new markets. Our system is the first in North America to fully automate the rental transaction process end-to-end, and the first to offer online ordering to all commercial renters and consumers. We're always looking at ways to walk-in our customers' shoes. And while many of our customers want a consultative approach, there are always customers who know exactly what to order and prefer to operate in a more digital manner. And we're excited to give those customers a more streamlined way to transaction with us.", "So, in conclusion, our second quarter performance is an accurate representation of where we believe we are in the cycle, with significant amount of runway ahead. We have many levers inherent in our business model, we fine tune our operations every day using CapEx, redeployment of assets, vertical strategies, cross-selling and used equipment sales, and we'll continue to do that at every operating environment. And as we move through 2016, we're using the inflow data to inform the balance of the year, and that's why you saw some minor adjustments to our guidance last night. We want to be as accurate as possible in our communications with the investment community, and we believe our business is properly calibrated for the current market opportunity. And we see that opportunity expanding, and we're continuing the growth in our end market demand.", "So with that, I'll hand it over to Bill. And so Bill can discuss the second quarter results. Over to you, Bill.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As always, I'll add a little color on the numbers for the quarter and update our outlook toward the end. We'll start with rental revenue, $1.204 billion of rental revenue in the quarter, that's down $17 million, or 1.3% compared to last year. The components of that really are driven by the owned-equipment revenue items, re-rent and ancillary, net essentially to zero on a year-over-year change basis. And within OER, the volume impact was the big positive. The 3% volume increase netted $33 million of year-over-year revenue benefit. That was offset by the 2.4% decline in rental rates, which was worth about $26 million of year-over-year rental rate \u2013 or revenue decline.", "Our CapEx inflation number was about $20 million of headwind this quarter, and then we had $4 million headwind from mix and other, and it's a net of a variety of different items. So, those are the key components of that $17 million year-over-year decline. Mixed in with all of that was the result of our change in the Canadian dollar. The currency impact in the quarter was about $5 million of headwind versus last year from currency strictly.", "Moving briefly to used equipment sales, $134 million of used equipment sales in the quarter was $10 million better than last year, and the adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 47.8%, that was down slightly versus last year and it primarily reflected slightly lower pricing for used equipment in the market overall, as well as a slightly greater mix of lower margin channels in the quarter, in particular, somewhat more through the vendor channel than the same quarter last year.", "Those are the key revenue items I wanted to mention, moving to profitability, starting with adjusted EBITDA. You saw $679 million for the quarter that was down $27 million versus last year. The margin in the quarter of 47.8% was also down 1.6 percentage points in margin and the key components were as follows. So, for the $27 million year-over-year decline, $25 million was the impact of rental rates that 2.4% rental rate impact clearly has a significant change on a year-over-year basis. Volume though, offset $21 million of that $25 million rate decline.", "Fleet inflation cost is about $12 million and our used equipment sales contributed an incremental $2 million positive over last year. We have a usual merit increase impact, it was about $6 million of decline this year, and then the net of mix and all the other factors was a headwind of about $7 million, that included a little bit of negative adjustment for incentive comp, negative in the sense that it was a greater expense this year than last year, reflecting a little bit higher accrual balance for the incentive programs. Had a little bit of a year-over-year headwind from an insurance accrual adjustment, but that was offset significantly by bad debt improvement over last year. So, those are the key components within that $7 million negative from mix and all other.", "Moving to adjusted EPS, you saw $2.06 for the quarter, that was $0.11 better than last year and it reflects all the factors that we talked up above, including a net impact of about $0.02 negative from the Canadian dollar. Our free cash flow, you saw that we delivered $792 million of free cash flow for the year-to-date through June 30, that's about $360 million better than last year. The primary drivers really were the lower spending on CapEx, lower spending and timing of CapEx spend, was worth about $300 million of that year-over-year change, and the rest was driven by lower interest expense and timing on working capital and the year-over-year difference in operating cash flow.", "Our rental growth CapEx, you saw that $722 million rental growth CapEx spend in the quarter, that was again consistent with guidance that we've given about how we want to approach rental CapEx this year, it's down from a comparable period last year, and it does build a net flexibility that Mike mentioned for our ability to spend in the back half of the year. The net rental CapEx for the year was $488 million and that compared to $569 million last year. ROIC in the quarter of 8.5% was down 50 basis points, and again reflects the impact of all the factors that we talked to so far.", "Moving quickly to liquidity and capital structure, we finished the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total liquidity that includes $1 billion of ABL capacity, that's available to us, and $265 million of cash available on the balance sheet. We had a lot of activity on the capital structure and, in particular, on debt redemptions in the quarter. In May, we closed the redemption of our 7.375% and 8.25% notes, as well as closed the new debt issue that we used to finance them. And then you saw that we announced that we will redeem the remaining balance of the 7.375% notes, the $200 million that remains outstanding in August that is when that will close.", "If you aggregate the impact of all those redemption actions so far this year, we expect that we'll be at an annualized run rate save on interest expense of about $30 million. So, some significant improvements of all of those redemption actions. We also took action to extend our ABL in the quarter, so that now we have that ABL maturing in 2021, and that is the first significant debt item that we have. Our debt maturities are very clear up until that point.", "Just a quick update on the share repurchase program. We bought a total of $171 million worth of shares in the quarter, and that brought our year-to-date purchases to $324 million. And in fact, it brought the program to-date purchases on this $1 billion authorization to $435 million since we started it late last year. So, we're on the pace to continue to deliver share repurchases as we talked about recently, we're spending on a pace of about $670 million or so for this year, and we will continue to execute that on a fairly steady pace.", "Regarding the limitations on restricted payments, that are inherent in some of our debt. We are still in very good shape there with about $560 million of available capacity when you add both the baskets of restricted payments limitations from the debt and the cash capacity that's available at the parent URI. So, well positioned to be able to continue the share repurchase program.", "Couple of points on our outlook for the remainder of the year, you saw that we did not change our revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges for the year, neither did we change our expectations for free cash flow or CapEx spend. On CapEx, I'll just note that we did put in a range around the $1.2 billion of CapEx that we're talking about, that was really done in response to the SEC's guidance to companies that they should be reconciling any non-GAAP financial forecast that they make to the nearest GAAP indicator, the nearest GAAP indicator for free cash flow is cash from operations, and when we try to reconcile to the range that we put around free cash flow, we decided that, we needed to put a range on CapEx. But it doesn't reflect any change in our thinking about spending on CapEx this year, we're still targeting the $1.2 billion that we had in our previous guidance.", "The two changes to our guidance revolve around rate and time utilization. You saw that we raised our rate range expected for the full year to down 2% to down 3%, that's up from the down 3% to down 4% that we had previously. At the same time, we lowered slightly our expectation for time utilization; we're now calling that at approximately 68% for the year, which would be about a 70 basis point improvement over last year. And really, we raised the rate and adjusted the time to reflect the experience that we had in second quarter and the approach that we're taking in managing those metrics and others for the remainder of the year.", "So, those are the key points of our outlook as they stand today. I know that the first question we get probably would be how is July going so far and that in finishing out the full year guidance that we're talking about, so just a couple of key points there. On rate, July has started out at a trend that looks like it will bring us at around flat sequentially for the month, compared to June and time utilization is up, and in fact, it's up a little bit more than what we experienced in June. So, it looks like it's up about 70 basis points, that's where we are today and that's a reasonable estimate for where we might end up for the year. So, those are the key points on July, and again, the key points of our guidance for the remainder of this year.", "One last point, regarding guidance in future periods, we've had a lot of discussion inside the company about what are the proper elements of guidance for us to put forth that will help us have as useful a conversation with all of you as investors as we can. And we've seen over the last several quarters, the challenge that we have in forecasting individual items of guidance, whether it's rate or time utilization, those two items in particular, those are a challenge to PEG, as individual elements of guidance, why? Because, we manage the company in a way that manages those two elements together.", "So, in order to get us more focused on how we approach managing the company, we've decided that we are going to eliminate providing rate and time utilization guidance, starting at the beginning of 2017. We'll finish the year out with the guidance that I just outlined. And then, starting in the new year, we'll eliminate those two elements. We will continue to provide you the actual results for rate and time after each quarter is complete in our earnings calls. We'll also continue to provide financial guidance on revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow and our capital spend. We think this is the best way to go forward in order to have the kind of conversation that we think, gives you the best insight about how we're approaching managing the business, and allows us to manage the business in the way that optimizes everything that we're after.", "So, those are the key comments I wanted to make. I'll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions-and-answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I guess starting out, Bill, could you address \u2013 you had cited before that you may see some modest rate growth in 2017, obviously an incremental improvement in May and June here, and then you just gave us 2017 which seems on path. I guess I'm looking for what you're thinking about the flow through into 2017 now, and if you could speak to if your trends monthly for rate are flat or up or down to the end of the year, how you would think about that 2017 context, please?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Sure, Scott. I'll start and certainly, Mike and Matt, please chime in. So, if you look at the range of rate guidance that we gave, if we were to deliver flat monthly sequentials for July through October, and then a normal kind of seasonal decline in November, December, that would put us to the minus 2% high end of our rate guidance. If all of that happened, then we would go into next year with a carryover of about flat for 2017. So that's the high end of the rate range guidance.", "At the low end, it would take sequential declines of about 0.6%, let's say, each month from July to October in order for us to come in at the down 3% end of our rate guidance. If that happened, again with a normal November, December, we'd have a carryover going into 2017 of about negative 1.5%. So that gives you the two ends of the spectrum as to how we could finish out this year and what it means for next year. Hopefully, that's responsive. If not, ask another question.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "That's great. Thanks for that. I'll just ask one more and then I'll turn it over. You cited internal initiatives and market environment as attributes to the improvement in rate in May and June. If you could elaborate on magnitude of each one, and then perhaps a little bit more on the internal initiatives? Thanks so much.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Scott. This is Matt. I would say the only reason we were able to achieve 90 bps of year-over-year time ut. and any sequential rate improvement, it all starts with demand. So we feel very good about the demand. So we give more credit to the opportunity that's out there and the customer demand for both of those.", "As far as what actions we took internally to drive May and June sequentially positive, it was really, as we look at those two levers of rate and time, we came out of Q1 with a rate performance that we didn't want to continue to absorb going forward and we had a little bit of headroom on time. So we were almost myopically focused on rate to achieve that, to the point where we even achieved sequential positive rates in markets that have really tough macros like Canada; that was in June. That was a lot of cutting the tail, so to speak, really getting rid of some of the anomalies, and just a very rigorous focus to reset the baseline of where our rates needed to be for us to continue to serve our customers in a profitable manner.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Scott, this is Mike. The only thing I would add to that is, we're using data and the live data that we've got it to a point now where we can communicate that to management much more simplistically and in a user format that they can help manage their markets better than what we had before. So it's a combination of both.", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, guys. I'll pass it over.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question, please.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi, good morning. Could you just comment on some of the volatility we've seen in the sequential trends? I think toward the end of April when you last reported, April was trending worse than what you actually experienced for the full month, and then we saw improvements in May and June, now July to show a little bit flattish. So maybe just kind of what you've seen over the course of those four months in terms of kind of what jumpstarted some of the improvement? And then in July, why maybe we've seen that taper when typically in a stronger demand environment we would continue to see month-over-month gains?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Joe. This is Matt. I think you have to first start with how sequential is measured, right. So it's the current month feeding off of the previous month. So by definition that great May, June performance raised the baseline to what you're being judged on in July. So what you saw was just the new contracts going out, as you think about it this way, were not greater than what you achieved in the previous month or the last contract that just came off rent. So there's a lot of inputs, and then you have to think about different geographies and different customer sets, and different products. So, I think to Bill's point about the ability and how difficult it is to forecast sequential rate on its own is proven out by the ebb and flow of what we've seen here in the first half of the year. It's a very, very dynamic metric.", "But as we manage the business day-to-day, as each manager out in the field is looking at it, you're balancing your decisions on rate and time and is that a profitable customer, not just on that individual transaction, but in the whole of our experience with that customer. So I would say it's just putting a little more emphasis on, as I answered in Scott's question, a little more emphasis on the rate than you normally would in a balanced environment to get the baseline back up to where it needed to be. And now we're going to make those business decisions based upon profitability and customer demand going forward.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. The only thing I would add to that is if there is an opportunity, we're going to take it. We're not shy. We've got the tools. We've got the management team that's myopically focused on it. So if there is an opportunity for us to take more, we're going to definitely reach for it.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one more on with what we've seen at some of the Rouse supply-demand data recently, I think on the demand side, some of that's explained with heavy equipment trends and some weather effects. But when you think about it on the supply side, outside of your own decisions, is your general sense that the industry is behaving rationally with the supply growth that we continue to see. And then related to that, do you think that we have now fully moved beyond some of the equipment redeployment related to oil?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So there are several answers there. So in my estimation, I think we have moved beyond the oil and I think that has been fully absorbed. I think what we're seeing now out of the Rouse is net new acquisitions or net new fleet being added to the mix. It's not unusual because typically in the second quarter our industry has a tendency to fleet up that captures the balance of the year. The answer is going to lie in what does the balance of the year look like and the good part of it is there's reports now that are out there that we can have a better understanding of what is happening and make adjustments accordingly and we have done that; that's number one.", "Number two, I think by order of magnitude when you ask is everyone playing safe or playing right, I think that one of the things that I took away from the Rouse report, I believe, it was in May, the report actually saw where the supply was below the demand. The demand was higher. So that would tell me that their people are being good stewards in understanding of the industry trends. The question is does it continue? That's everyone's question.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Thank you.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question, please.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "So kind of a follow-up to that last question. It sounds like folks are being good stewards and growing fleet at a lower pace, but what are you seeing in terms of the competitive environment in terms of price? So certainly your focus on price has been a significant driver of sequential improvement here. What are you seeing in terms of competitive pressure as well?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, Nick. This is Matt. I mean, it's been competitive. It's been competitive for the past 18 months. And I would say that to Mike's point about the Rouse data, that supply continuing to moderate should help ease some of that competitiveness because the demand is there. So that's the great news, if demand is there. I think the challenge that we have to focus on is when you are the big guy on the block, you have the requirement to be the leader.", "And we take that leadership position very seriously and there is always going to be in any given market somebody that wants what you have. That's nothing new. By the way that happened during the peak runs in the 2000s and it happened from 2010 to 2014, and we just need to make sure we keep a balanced approach to how we're going to defend the business we have as well as grow upon new end-markets and that's why you hear a lot of focus on our specialty business, on our value prop, and bundling all of our services and utilizing our footprint in a way that's unique advantage to us. So that's how we balance it, Nick, and that's how we'll continue to go on.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then can you just talk more about demand trends, particularly in Canada? What are you seeing there and are there potentially more fleet transfers that you can do? How are you working to mitigate any kind of weakness there?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So from a demand perspective, Canada is still very, very challenged. Now there's some provinces like if you look at the GTA, the Greater Toronto Area, we're actually up year-over-year. So there are some good spots, B.C. isn't bad in Western Canada. But if you can imagine the provinces that are resource reliant and commodity reliant markets, they're really hurting right now.", "As far as fleet movement, I think that we'd pretty much move the fleet out of Canada, if we need to. As we sit here today, our Canadian business is down over 11%, but that's only 3.1% on fleet on rent volume. It's almost 8% on rate. So we think we've got the fleet right-sized in Canada, and I think most of our competitors have done the right thing as well and gotten their footprints and their head count and their fleet rationalized to the current market conditions.", "Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC", "Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mili Pothiwala from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. So, I guess, could you just provide sort of an update on how you're thinking about the non-resi environment? Obviously, you seem fairly positive on the near-term, but I guess more generally, how you're thinking about the cycle here, especially given some of the data points we've seen on the macro front have been more choppy recently? And then just as a follow-up, I guess, can you jut parse out which verticals are stronger, which ones are weaker, any end markets that got incrementally better or worse during the quarter?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'll try and take. This is Mike. I'll try and take a macro view, and then I'll let both Bill and Matt talk about and chime in as well as the verticals. But you're right, there's positive encouraging comments around construction, and there's also some negative and cautious variables out there. I mentioned the ABI, the Dodge Momentum Index is another one, non-res starts, contractor backlog, the ISM, PMI, our own customer survey, these trend towards the positive. On the other side, we mentioned the Rouse non-res construction put in place that slowed a bit. The other part would be the construction employment numbers that came down. The question we have to ask ourselves is how much that was due to projects related in and around the oil and also possibly some weather related. (37:31) keeps on coming down here in the U.S.", "So when we look at our backlogs and we talk to our customers, they are very optimistic in looking out over the next year of the projects they've got booked. And we're not going to go into details because I'm sure a lot of my competitors are on the phone too. But do I think that our overall construction will be tempered a little bit, yes. Do I think has it gone down to a point where we're not going to see growth, no. I think that the fundamentals are still there as we see it today. And that's kind of how we're looking at it. Matt and Bill can chime in or add more about the verticals.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. I'll start by addressing the non-res, Mili. It is our biggest vertical and we still saw a nice growth in non-res in the second quarter. And we can make that statement about the first half of the year as well. And some of the indicators that Mike pointed to I think would argue that we should continue to see nice growth, maybe not quite as strong as what we saw sort of late last year, early this year in non-res, but still it should be nice, right, whether it's ABI, whether it's Dodge Momentum Index, some of the REIT starts data, backlogs that we've seen from various industry groups would support that non-res verticals should remain a solid base for us of growth.", "And then when you look in some of the other verticals, we've seen growth in our downstream oil and gas vertical in the most recent quarters. That's encouraging to us. Upstream is still a challenge as you might imagine. But the refineries and some of the other related industries have been solid growth for us as well. Again, there's some timing items that flow through, but certainly that's a nice platform for us that we think will continue to be a growth engine go forward. And then there are host of other verticals where we can point to that do see growth going forward. Matt, I'll ask if you want to focus on any in particular. If not, I can continue to take off.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, I think we've covered it. I think, the largest opportunity is, what we've learned through our process of our go-to-market after some specific verticals and the success we had there, has really paid off. So it's not just where the end-market is, but where are the verticals that we can bundle our services, and support our customers, maybe deeper than we have in the past is something that we're really focused on and we're encouraged with the results.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. I guess just in the context of that could you provide any thoughts on how you're thinking about CapEx into 2017?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, sure, Mili. You saw in our investor material, we put a range out there between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion I guess was the top of the range that we put out. And I would say that we really do think about that full range as being available to us for 2017. As we go through our planning process starting up here in a couple months, we'll refine our view. But we are really going into 2017 saying look, our expectation is that the overall market will continue with attractive growth for us, and that will put us in a position so that we could spend anywhere in that range. The $1.2 billion that we're spending this year, I'll remind you, was heavily influenced by our desire to get our utilization up this year. We were down last year, we wanted to recapture that this year. And, I think we're making real good progress in doing that this year. If we do what we want this year, and if the market is still robust next year which we expect, then we'll be talking about, okay, what's the right number, and it will fall somewhere in that range. So, more to come, as we refine our thinking about next year.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Yup.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Seth.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. I actually wanted to touch on the 2017 CapEx point as well. Since you have kind of laid out this framework for us where if rates kind of are at that down 2% number for this year, you've talked about carryover into next year kind of flat from a rate environment. So Bill, trying to get a little bit more granular here, if you're looking at flat rates for next year, where does that put you in that $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion spectrum, is that enough to go the top end of that spectrum, and if you're down 3% this year, does that put you to the $1.2 billion? I'm trying to just pin you down a little bit more relative to this new data that you've given us.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate being pinned down. Look, we will have much more conversation about it, and answering a hypothetical is always a very dangerous game. What I would say is if we felt like we were carrying flat carryover into next year, and if we were confident in the demand supporting that or better, then I think we'd be more willing \u2013 certainly more willing to spend more than the $1.2 billion we're doing this year.", "How far up we would go in that total range? Hard to say right here and now. $1.7 billion is the max that we've ever said, $1.6 billion would be a shade under that. The question at the top end of the range is, A, would you have enough confidence in the environment to spend close to the max that you've ever spent? That would be a robust discussion. That said, it's on the table as we sit right here and now.", "More realistically, I think, we're probably looking something more like what we spent last year, that $1.5 billion kind of number. Again, but that would be dependent on us saying, yeah, we've got a rate environment that's okay, and we've got a demand environment that looks like it's going to sustain. And it's got to feel like it's going to sustain more than just calendar 2017, right. And so, those are the kinds of things that we'd be discussing; we'll be able to say more as we get into our Investor Day late this year.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Would you expect the mix still \u2013 the growth capital to still be skewed towards the specialty business in that scenario? Call it $1.5 billion, would you be \u2013 would the large majority of that growth continue to go towards specialty?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. If we were at $1.5 billion \u2013 again, dangerous game playing with hypotheticals, but I think specialty would still be a very significant portion of the growth capital in that kind of scenario. I'll remind you what we said before, right, this year, we don't have a lot of growth capital in our gen rent business after you include the effect of inflation.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, if we're spending more than the $1.2 billion, then some of that incremental spend would be going into the gen rent side of the business, but we'd also be supporting the growth in our specialty businesses in a robust way as well.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And then just to follow-up on the energy markets. Rig count seems to have stabilized here, commodity prices are stabilizing. Have you heard anything from your customers with respect to project activity restarting, incremental demand around kind of the current environment, or do you think that's still on the come?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes, Seth, this is Matt. I would say it's still too early for that. Everybody is reading the same rig data and the same reports, and I would say it's still too early for us to see it materialize into additional revenue, but it does give us comfort that we may have passed the trough, which is good news. And we were kind of planning on flat in the oil and gas markets for this year anyway. So we've moved the fleet appropriate. We think we have some existing capacity in there to absorb a little uptick, which would be great, but nothing that's making us think that we'd actually be moving more fleet into the oil and gas market at this point.", "Seth R. Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Terrific. Thanks very much, guys.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Seth.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, George.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Hi, thanks, good morning.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, George.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Bill, can you flesh out some of the factors that contributed to your lower time utilization guidance for the full year and how you see time ut. playing out during the remainder of the peak rental season?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, George. So, I mean, we touched on it before. It's partly the interplay between rate and time, and how we expect to be able to manage that go forward for the second half. We think the demand environment will be there to allow us to realize our goal for the year, which was nice year-over-year time ut. improvement. And we've got to make sure that we're approaching the market in a way that that allows us to do that, while also realizing as much rate as we can. So, I think that's really how to respond back, right, is that \u2013 it's the interplay between rate and time that we expect. We do expect to be able to continue to drive nice year-over-year improvement in time utilization. You saw 30 basis points in June, that's below where we want to be and need to be, and so we expect that we'll be delivering a little bit more year-over-year improvement as we go into the back half of the year. And we're going to be focused on doing that.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Got it. And Mike, can you comment on how you expect OEC-on-rent to grow in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year, particularly as oil and gas comps begin to lap after 2Q?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. I think, there's a chart that we have out there, on our \u2013 it's on page six of our investor deck, that kind of shows the cadence of how our OEC-on-rent has progressed this year in comparison to other years. And you can see where it lift up last, as Bill mentioned, our July time utilization is up nicely. So, I think, the cadence you see there is going to be a similar pattern of delay in which it follows by the seasons.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, George, to the numbers, I think, you saw 3% OEC-on-rent growth in the second quarter. If I had to put some numbers to it, I'd say we might be just slightly under that in the third quarter, and around that number in the fourth quarter as sort of a way we're thinking about it. We need that kind of growth in order to get to the utilization improvement that we're looking for on the capital plan that we have, but I don't want to get overly precise with those numbers, because as we said that interplay between how we go at rate and time utilization which is OEC-on-rent in the numerator is something that we're going to manage actively as we go forward.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, George", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, David.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "Hey. I know we're working with a lot of midpoints here, but \u2013 and I can happily take you through all the math. It still seems that you're implying 2017 EBITDA to be down a little bit, when you capture all the aspects of your free cash flow guidance midpoint for next year, how you're viewing your net debt-to-EBITDA leverage. So, if I can just ask you straight out, is that what you're trying to imply with these numbers, or it just TBD, to be updated in October, and I'm \u2013 obviously I'm looking at slide 20 as you're \u2013 what kind of leverage do you expect in 2017, be it 2.6 times, 2.7 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Again, it's implying EBITDA down next year, I just wanted to ask you is that what you're trying to imply?", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, David, we give the range that we give to be explicit, the ranges on all of the guidance that we give, could lead you there. And I can't argue with the math that could come out, but I just, I think we do this every quarter, I'll just emphasize that the ranges are ranges for a reason.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "Sure.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And don't anchor yourself too much to the midpoints of the ranges in guiding how you think about how we're going to do this year. Now that said, we are facing an environment where we expect rates to be down 2% to 3%, that's a significant headwind for a year to start out with, and utilization improvement is a great thing to try and offset that, but rate is pretty powerful as you know. So, that's a challenge that we are working to overcome. Will we overcome it or not, tune in later in the year and we'll see.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "And a question about the CapEx planning for next year, even within that CapEx, where you would allocate the capital, clearly specialty rental has been a focus. But, when you look at the dollar utilization year-over-year, you kind of see booms and lifts the dollar ut. has been \u2013 at least this past quarter was pretty negative, but trench and other has really been very negative. I mean, it's getting less negative, but it's been still pretty challenged, I mean, it was the worst for this quarter, it's been the worst year-over-year dollar ut. now for five quarters or so. How should we think about that? And maybe educate me, and when you say trench and other, how much is that capturing any of the specialty rental, I'm just surprised that dollar ut. has been that weak. It's actually been the weakest of your four major categories you provide us with the data?", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, David, this is Matt. That trench and other is a real broad bucket, you've got pumps in there, you've got light towers in there, you've got all kinds of stuff in there that's watering it down. So, I would not take that trench and other as a proxy for specialty in any way, shape or form. If it were just specialty, we'd still have the drag, that the pumps dealing with, right, obviously.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "Sure.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "But, I would not \u2013 we'd probably change the label on that, maybe it won't be trench and other, maybe it will just be other, but that is not a proxy for our specialty product.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "All right. That's good to know. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, David.", "Matthew John Flannery - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question today comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question please.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "You kind of touched on this earlier, but I wondered if you would hazard a guess as to the shape of Canada over the next couple years. It's obviously very, very weak. You mentioned some sort of sequential strength. I mean, when do you think it will trough and is there enough fleet rationalization to get profits back without a sharp rebound, just maybe the shape of what you see?", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "This is Mike. As Matt mentioned, it's really a tale of two sides. There are some positives that are happening out of the East as opposed to the West and Western Canada, which was impacted by oil. But on top of that also the players that put things on delay. I will tell you that to restart the facilities there takes an enormous amount of work. It's not an easy feat. So and as you think that, that will be \u2013 the things have stabled out. So, I think over time, with the capital investment that the government has committed, we'll start to trickle in over time. My sense is that, could it be a year, that's anyone's guess. I know, I can't predict where oil will be, tried that didn't work, but my sense is that, it's probably more on the mends than it is on a decline.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's helpful. Thank you. I'll see you soon. Thanks.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "William B. Plummer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Rob.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland.", "Michael J. Kneeland - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, thanks, operator. I want everyone to feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, who heads up our IR here in Stamford, and also our new investor presentations are available and downloaded on our site. I wanted to thank everybody for taking the time out to join us on today's call. So, I think today is \u2013 now is an appropriate time to end it.

My. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on today's call. Before I begin, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day, which will be held on Thursday, December 1st in New York. We hold this conference every two years and the webcast is the most dependent event. This time, we\u2019re taking a deep dive into different initiatives we have underway including customer strategies, fleet management, process innovations and other areas that demonstrate how we're maximizing the value of our company for shareholders. I hope you join us. Now, let's go into the quarter.", "Our operating environment played out largely as we expected, demand continue to trend up driving an increase in volume of equipment on rent. Our specialty operations continue to outperform both the rental industry and our company as a whole delivering solid benefits to revenue, margin and returns. And major initiatives such as cross-selling are ramping up nicely. The revenue contribution from cross-selling has increased sequentially throughout 2016. In the third quarter, cross-selling to national accounts grew by a robust 14% year-over-year.", "Now, these gains were offset by three ongoing headwinds in our industry. They are the Canadian economy, upstream oil and gas, and the current fleet balance. But overall, the market continues to move in our favor. I guess this backdrop we did a good job with rental revenue. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was essentially flat despite softer rates. We were pleased to deliver adjusted EPS of $2.58 per diluted share and as well as adjusted EBITDA of 747 million and a margin of 49.5%. And free cash flow continued to be a robust 846 million through September while our CapEx spending stayed on plan.", "Now, based on this performance and given the visibility into the fourth quarter, we've narrowed some of our guidance to help you model our business. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be at the top end of the range, we previously provided. We also feel confident that we can improve on our full year rate declines we forecasted earlier with no significant impact time utilization. And we expect record free cash flow of more than a billion dollars which would exceed our original guidance. And as we considered the best way to service our large contract wins, we made by and up to an additional $50 million of fleet in the fourth quarter. So, no surprise as in terms of the cycle or our own performance, I would characterize as it's being right on track.", "Next, I want to spend a few minutes on our operating environment. There are some positive indicators. Dodge has reported that new constructions starts are up over 22% sequentially in August with the most meaningful gains coming from commercial and public construction. Non-residential starts increased significantly overall a 43% in August and another 5% in September. This is consistent with other U.S. construction data, which show the backlogs for large contractors hit a new high this year. And many of these jobs can take months or years to complete, which gives us added visibility into demand going forward.", "Another key bellwether is our customer survey. Our customers felt good about their business prospectus throughout the quarter. In fact, the August survey indicated the strongest optimism of the past nine months. And the September employment report was also encouraging, which show that jobs in the U.S. construction sector increased for the first time in months. While there is some evidence of headwinds such as a modest contraction in the architectural billing index in August, overall the market feels positive to us. So, it's a widely marketplace for us in the U.S. with the strong pipeline of new projects breaking ground. Geographically, we're seeing the most growth on the East and West coasts. On the West Coast, we have four major construction projects that will run through at least mid-year 2017. Another two sites are staring up this quarter. Solar power and automotive, our two key verticals in government spending in California remains robust.", "In the Mid-Atlantic, our business is trending up from the past two quarters with the healthy mix of projects. These include power and pharmaceutical plans, a casino, hospital, airport renovation and retail malls. Further south, a number of tourism projects are driving growth, and automotive plants are underway in South Carolina. The Southeast metro areas overall continue to represent large opportunities for both our gen rent and specialty operations.", "Now, I want to give a shout out to our employees in the Southeast who've been working long hours in disaster recovery mode following Hurricane Matthew. Our people are doing a stealer job of helping hard-hit communities in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. And the restoration in these states could take years to complete. As to U.S. snapshot by contract, the Canadian economy is still a challenge compounded by the energy sector in Western provinces. Rental revenue from Canada in the quarter declined by approximately 10%, and fine line for us in this environment is to invest enough growth capital to serve our customers and grow our business without adding to the industry and balance of fleet.", "So, we're walking at that line really well in 2016, continued to use a balance strategy of deploying our CapEx in a very important manner while also relocating our existing fleet away from softer markets. The major beneficiary to our growth CapEx as we noted before is our specialty segment, in the third quarter especially had a strong showing. Rental revenue for this segment increased by more than 9% in the quarter versus 2015, within that segment revenue from Power & HVAC was up 17% and Trench Safety was up over 5%. The largest tailwind behind these two increases was same-store growth. We also had a 5% revenue growth in Pump where our strategy of end market diversification is paying off. And we seem to be a turning point and neutralizing to drag from upstream oil and gas.", "And finally, I want to give you an update on our digital strategy. We\u2019ve gone from zero to over a $1 million a month in online orders in just 12 weeks. So while this strategy is still very young, we've seen enough to know, it's got legs. Some of the business is coming from our existing customers, who want the digital convenience and summer from first-time customers though achieving both of our objectives of e-commerce, which are to increase the stickiness with our current based and to capture more customers to our new channel.", "So to recap the quarter, there were no surprises. The Company is solidly on track, and we\u2019re continued to focus with the many leverage within our control. Demand is also on track based on what we saw in the quarter and what we hear from our customers, and we believe the cycle still has one way ahead. And our full year results should be nearly upper half of our prior guidance and a number of key metrics, and we expect our free cash flow to be more than a $1 billion this year. Now, we are mindful of the uncertainty that continues to be prevalent in the global economy, but I also want to remind you that we have considerable flexibility in operating our business to address any change in market dynamics. It gives us great deal of confidence in managing the business for strong full year performance we have reaffirmed today.", "So with that, I\u2019ll ask Bill to discuss the numbers and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everyone. As usual, we\u2019ll step to the highlights in the quarter and then update our outlook to finish up. So let\u2019s start with rental revenue that was down $4 million year-over-year or 0.3. Within that $4 million, re-rent and ancillary revenues in the quarter were actually up $5 million over last year as was the volume component change in OEC on rent, which was a positive $26 million contribution from last year. The offsets to those were rental rates that down 1.7%, translates into about $19 million of year-over-year decline, and our replacement CapEx inflation which was worth about $18 million of year-over-year decline.", "The remainder was mix and other, which was a positive $2 million versus last year, so all of those net to the $4 million or 0.3 decline. Within that rental revenue result, the Canadian currency impact this quarter was fairly minimal. The currency was basically unchanged from last year and so had no significant effect on the overall rental revenue performance. But if you look at the effect of the entirety of our Canadian operations, it's still represented a headwind. Excluding Canada, our U.S. revenue -- U.S. only revenue would have been up 0.8%, so a significant impact from Canada, and we can touch on that more in the Q&A if there are questions.", "Our used equipment sales results for the quarter was $112 million of used equipment revenue, that was down $29 million or just under 21% compared to last year. That decrease was primarily driven by the high level of used sales that we had last year as we were moving equipment in response to the oil and gas challenge that we saw last year. So, that decline in revenue, we think was mitigated somewhat by the fact that we used our retail channel more significantly this year. In fact, you can see it in the adjusted gross margin result. Adjusted gross margin this quarter was 46.4% and that was 2.4 percentage points better than last year, and certainly that benefitted from a much stronger use of the retail channel and much less use of auctions this year compare to last year.", "Moving quickly to adjusted EBITDA, the 747 million of adjusted EBITDA we reported was down $33 million versus last year, and that reflected the puts and takes that I talked about in the rental revenue description. In particular, rental rates cost us about $19 million versus last year, but volume offset $17 million of that headwind during the quarter. The inflation, however, costs us about $15 million compared to last year, and the used equipment result cost us another 12. Merit increases, we always call out worth about $6 million year-over-year headwind and then the mix and other was $2 million positive impact. So, those were the pieces of the $33 million year-over-year decline in adjusted EBITDA.", "Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 49.5%, that was down 80 basis points versus last year and again it reflects all the components that we talked about here previously. Just a quick update within that EBITDA performance was our lien contribution for the year. Updating that progress, we ended the quarter at an annualized run rate of $96 million contribution from our lien and other savings initiatives and that compares to the $81 million we reported at the end of the second quarter. So making nice progress and as you all know that we are targeting the 100 million run rate by the end of this year and we still feel very comfortable about achieving that 100 million target by the end of December.", "Our adjusted EPS $2.58 for the quarter was up a $0.01 versus last year and again it had de minimis impact from currency in the year and obviously reflected the impacts of the operational results that we talk about, as well as the benefit of the share repurchase that I'll touch on a little bit later. Free cash flow during the quarter -- year-to-date period, free cash flow was $846 million and that was better by almost $340 million compared to last year.", "The primary drivers were lower rental CapEx spending that was worth about $280 million compared to last year, right for the year-to-date period. We also had a lower cash taxes roughly 41 million and the timing of working capital was a benefit versus last year roughly $110 million. Those were the positives and they offset on a year-over-year basis to decline in adjusted EBITDA that we seen year-to-date.", "Our net debt finish the quarter at $7.7 billion and that was down roughly $640 million, compared to where it was in September of last year. Now, a good portion of that change is timing, so don\u2019t extrapolate to the year-end. But we\u2019re still going to finish with very, very significant reduction in our overall net debt position, and I think that speaks to the cash flow benefits that we\u2019ve been experiencing as well.", "On the CapEx front, our gross rental CapEx in the quarter was $423 million that was up from last year about $15 million, and it brought our full year year-to-date CapEx spend to a 1.145 billion, on our way to that 1.2 billion to 1.250 billion range that we updated in our outlook, which again I\u2019ll touch on again in a minute. Net rental CapEx for the quarter was $311 million, that's up from last year and primarily reflected the difference in used equipment sales, as well as some timing effects. When you put it all together, our ROIC performance in the quarter was down 70 basis points to 8.3% in the quarter, obviously reflecting the impact of the operating measures particularly rate as we discussed previously.", "On liquidity, we finish the quarter with just under 1.1 billion of total liquidity, and that includes about 720 million or so of ABL capacity available to us, as well as just under $300 million worth of cash on the balance sheet. The capital structure just briefly, you all recall that during the second quarter, we had some redemption. We completed those actions during the course of the third quarter by redeeming the remaining $200 million of our 7.375 note. We funded that redemption in Q3 by a draw on the ABL. So when you put all the actions on the capital structure together for the year, we\u2019re at a annualize savings of about $30 million of interest for the future periods.", "So quick update on the share repurchase program, we brought $152 million worth of shares during the course of Q3 that brings our year-to-date total for sharing purchase to $476 million. If you extent the look back to the beginning of this current authorization, the billion dollar authorization, we\u2019ve now spent $587 million of that billion dollar of authorization that we have. Our plan for the remainder of this year to continue on the pace that we\u2019ve been, we\u2019ve been talking about a pace of spend of roughly 150, 160 a quarter, and we plan to continue on that pace in Q4.", "We have the flexibility to be able to execute the share repurchase. Just an update on the covenant and cash position, we finish the quarter with about $560 million worth of capacity for share repurchases under our restricted payments limitation plus the cash on the balance sheet. Let we finish out with an update to our outlook for the full year and quick comment on October. The outlook you've seen in the press release, but just to hit a couple of key points, we\u2019ve narrowed the range of most of our outlook measures in order to reflect the fact that we've got 9 of the 12 months already in the books. And so our rental revenue is now within the $100 million range between 5.650 billion -- total revenue is within the range of 5.650 billion to 5.750 billion. EBITDA, we narrowed to a $50 million range with the bottom of the range at 2.7 billion going up to 2.75 billion. And you've all seen the rental rate guidance we narrowed that to 2.1% to 2.3% declines for the full year.", "I mentioned and Michael mentioned, our CapEx plan right now, we're calling in a range of 1.2 billion to 1.25 billion with any incremental spend being targeted at specific projects that we've been awarded and are need to spend in order to support those customer needs. And finally, we mentioned that our improved outlook for free cash flow takes us to at least $1 billion; call it $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow over the course of the full year. Regards to October, our rates performance so far in October is trending toward a flat to slightly down result for the full months of October on a sequential month basis.", "And if you look at where we are on time utilization for the month of October, month-to-date, our average is up about 80 basis points over where it was last year. And if you look at it just on a one day snapshot as of today we are actually up a 100 basis points over where we were on the comparable day last year. So that supports the trend in improvement in utilization that we would need in order to deliver the time utilization outlook that we have for the full year. That full year outlook is approximately 67.8%, and we would need something like 80 basis points each month or remainder of the year in order to hit that new time utilization guidance.", "So, those are the key points that I wanted to make. I'll stop there, and ask the operator to open up the call here for questions-and-answers. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question please.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Pretty straight forward, so thanks for that. I actually have just kind of more general question. As you see your national competitors expand and then well I just had a sort of five-year plan, that was put out, I mean as they come into market or expanded markets for you, are you seeing most of the shared come out from the smaller, less formal competitors in the world. Are we seeing a steady, the big people in the industry steadily winning out of the smaller ones or do you see a big depth in each market as I do? I'm just little bit curious, if the expansion is accelerated in the consolidation of the industry. Thanks.", "Matthew Flannery", "So, Robert, this is Matt. I think everybody is running their playbook and we are aware that we have one national competitor that's still got some growth ahead of them from a filling out their footprint. But at the small de minimis market share that they are at, I'm not sure that drives the changes in the market place as much as the other 70% that we don\u2019t have visibility to, for the 25 years in this business that I've been in any market I participated in has somebody trying to get some shift, for various different reasons. So, this is part of being the rental business, you are going to need to sometimes protect share, sometimes gain share. I'll tell you that where we are focused on in making sure we are not just chasing the last dollar of revenue, but profitability remains our focus regardless of what anybody else is doing in. And just to put context, when you think about all the local regional and maybe some semi-national competitors, it\u2019s a competitive market, but there is a lot of demand. And we feel that the absorption is better off today than it was six months ago of the fleet in the industry, and we\u2019re encourage by that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Nicole DeBlase", "So my first question is around oil and gas. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what you saw during the quarter with respect to the different verticals, so like upstream, midstream and downstream, and is there anything notably improving at all given what we've seen with the oil price so far?", "Matthew Flannery", "Nicole, this is Matt. I wouldn\u2019t say that there has been much improvement in the upstream. There has been some noise about the rig count being slightly up over a much lower base, and we even have put out what we call few frac packs, but really a small amount compared to historically what we used to out to those basis. The good news is, we do feel it\u2019s bottomed out. And so, we don\u2019t know, we\u2019re not counting on much of an uptick in upstream right now, but we are positioned in the case, there is one. I think the surprising element that not everybody on the call may recognize is that refining is still pretty robust end market for us. We're up almost 10% in refining on a year-over-year basis. So, not all oil and gas is a challenge for us, just really the upstream. And we\u2019re encourage by that, and we think this fourth quarter there will be even more activity, a lot of turnaround activity that our customers are speaking of, so we feel pretty good about that sector.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay. Thanks Matt, that\u2019s helpful. And then kind of on a similar topic, if we could talk a little bit about Canada, you guys provided a little bit of color and opening remarks. But have you seen any signs of stabilization in Canada or trends still deteriorating?", "Matthew Flannery", "I would say similarly that Canada, the good news is that they bottomed out. The difference is, we still have some -- I think we still have some more year-over-year headwinds in Canada than we do just strictly in upstream. But the team up there is actually fought pretty well to even getting some sequential positives in the last couple of months; just a year-over-year headwind is still significant. Our rent revenue for the quarter was down 10.7%. But most of that was rate that was a 5.3% rate decrease. But their volume there, what we see on rent only down 4% and that\u2019s after we pulled over 8% fleet out of there. So, we feel, we\u2019ve right-sized our business from a fleet headcount and footprint perspective without damaging our ability to participate in whenever they get some tailwinds at their back. So, they\u2019ve done a good job mitigating that 10% through the P&L without weakening our position. Hopefully, next year, they get some tailwinds.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC. Your question please.", "Seth Weber", "So, I want to ask about the large contract wins that you called out in the press release. I mean, can you give us any color on what that involves? Were those conquest wins from other rental companies or those projects that the companies had previously furnished equipment themselves internally? And can you maybe give us some idea the duration of this project to justify going out and buying new equipment at a time when utilization levels are okay, but they\u2019re not rising? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, this is Mike. Let me just say that, it's always competitive about there. So regardless of when you say, are we taking this or away from somebody, it is a competitive marketplace. So it's very broad. We were very fortunate to be able to be - to take a multiyear contract that we need to make sure that we be able to meet the customer demand. As Matt mentioned earlier, we've been very good about looking at our fleet, managing our fleet, and if you remind everybody that we really didn\u2019t put any growth capital in our core business into all this year. So it has been by moving fleet around. We exhausted our resources in looking at what is needed, and by the way as we said, we would spend up to and that's still yet to be determined. But I thought it was prudent to make sure that we communicated that to everybody. If there is an opportunity for us to be able to reposition fleet at that time, to satisfy that, we'll do that. But right here in now and as Bill mentioned about what we're seeing in October on utilization is actually up year-to-date and on average for the month of October. So, the demand is there as Matt said earlier.", "Matthew Flannery", "Yes, I think Mike covered it well said. But I would say just the simply answer, it's a yes on that these are long-term projects. And the amount of fleet that we need to fund for one specific plant award, and then a couple of large projects that match with Mike referred to in his opening comments, including some nice infrastructure projects. This represents a very small single digit percentage of what would be needed on the life for that project, so we'll be able to take existing capacity to put on this project. But if we don\u2019t feel these immediate needs that we don\u2019t have available right now, we don\u2019t get to participate in the other 90% plus of this project. So, these projects will mostly be served by the $9 billion of fleet that we are already on.", "William Plummer", "And just to emphasize, I know you know this, but to emphasize, even if we spend the incremental 50, the cash flow for the year still in that 1 billion to 1.1 billion range. So, it includes the possibility of spending that incremental 50.", "Seth Weber", "Sure. I appreciate that's helpful. Thanks, Bill. And then just a quick follow-up on the lean initiatives, it sounds like you said you are very close to kind of hitting your target for this year, for exiting the year. So, should we expect to hear new initiatives at the Analyst Meeting, additional efficiency or cost measures that you are talking about for 2017?", "William Plummer", "Yes, we're still deciding exactly how we are going to approach that Investor Day, but I think it's fair to say that we will be talking about initiatives that we think will have positive impact in our financial performance, over the next couple of years.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.", "David Raso", "When I think about where your better visibility lies, I would I think would be national accounts and maybe large projects. So, if you can keep your answer to those accounts, those projects, what are you seeing and when you reprise national accounts on pricing? And then also how you think about looking into the first half of 2017, is the utilization still growing on those accounts in first half 2017 versus first half 2016? Obviously, I'm trying to think about the fourth quarter, you feel pretty good about utilization growing. I think you said about 80 bps. Rates obviously seasonally were down November, December, but in general rates were still a little bit of struggle sequentially as we saw in August and September. So, not the short-term business where you really have visibility, are you re-pricing national accounts at a higher or lower levels and what kind of visibility do you have on the utilization into next year?", "Matthew Flannery", "So, David, this is Matt. I would say on national account pricing, what we\u2019re experienced on a year-over-year perspective from national accounts does not differ much from what we see in our overall business. Now, admittedly, they are all coming off different baselines. So you could imagine that national accounts are going to leverage that spend. But that\u2019s already built into the baseline, so we\u2019re not seeing a tremendous amount of difference between our overall business rate performance and national account. What we are seeing and it\u2019s a big part of our focus strategically is that our national account growth in Q2 was higher than what are overall growth was as a company. So to your point, there is greater visibility into it. It\u2019s already such a big part of our business, and we still have such an established baseline. But I don\u2019t think, there is a lot of headwind to a tailwind by customer segment because they're pretty well established. But the growth and the demand is still there in that space and that remains key focus. And they do most of the large projects, so they kind to go hand and hand when your question was about project and national accounts.", "David Raso", "And that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure, and we all can have our own view on the shorter term rentals swing on how we view activity for next year. At least the start the year still sounds like more of a lean on utilization growth, and the rate for now we could all assume what we want. But it does seem like the rate is necessarily growing on these new accounts, it\u2019s more about utilization and then make your own call about the shorter term projects?", "Matthew Flannery", "I would necessary say because remember embedded in that national account pricing experience is the largest headwind that we have. Most of our oil and gas business was national account business. So that national account to similar to the Company average had to absorb almost all of the oil and gas experience, which is negative on the year-over-year perspective. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessary characterize it that way. The truth is, we'll find out in the future. But as we sit here today and where our business is today, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I would actually say, they\u2019ve absorbed more pain overall in that business.", "David Raso", "So when we start re-pricing those contracts and that will be an interesting thing to delve into. When do those contracts come up? I know you\u2019re generalizing a lot of different accounts, but when, I mean, want to be positive and say, hey, oil is a little bit higher today and is that a different tenor in the conversation about what you could charge? When do those conversations start-up?", "Matthew Flannery", "So the 25% on net of fixed-price all had different expiration dates. And most of them are multiple years, so it\u2019s not really a clean answer for you. I would say that, it\u2019s throughout the year. As far as the projects, they will price accordingly. And it really depends more on what market projects are in as far as the price volatility and who is more capable of supplying of the assets that are needed. And we feeling on some of the ones that we recently won, we\u2019re very well position. And we\u2019ll continue to focus on where we\u2019re very well positioned versus chasing down somewhere where we may not have it as much a competitive advantage, and that\u2019s part of our focus on profitable growth versus just revenue for the sake of revenue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George Tong", "You're at the point in the rental season where a lot of re-change co-insides with the equipment coming off rent, which implies less control over rate compared to the beginning of the cycle. In line of this, what factors help give you confidence that rates will come in at the higher end of your prior guidance?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. And I'll ask Matt and Bill also to chime in. But as you heard from Bill that currently our utilization is up nicely on a year-over-year for the months, so that continues. You also heard that our rates are flat to slightly down. I think the industry overall is being more responsible in the way in which they are managing it. The imbalance is continuing to get better and better, so I give the industry a lot of credit for being responsible. So that would be part of it. There is going to be a necessity for the industry as a total to try to achieve higher pricing, or drive better efficiencies, or manage their business much more efficiently. So that to me gives me confidence as I see that those trends play out as we've seen it over the course of the year. And Matt or Bill, you want to add anything more to that?", "William Plummer", "I'd say in addition to that, the math gets me confidence right. I mean we've now experienced 9 to 12 of the year, right. The remaining three months are going to be -- will make it pretty hard to move that full year rate down significantly. Just to give you a specific set of numbers, in order to get to that 2.1 decline in rental rates for the full year. October, November, December would all have to be down two times each. It's not a ridiculous notion, but in order to get for the down 2.3 scenario for the full year each of those months would have to be down 0.6 sequentially.", "I think it's highly unlikely that we are going to do that and certainly even more unlikely that, it will be worse than that. So I just look at the raw mathematics that what it would take in order to come outside of the range of the rates that we've given, that 2.1 to 2.3 seems pretty well assured and it's not ridiculous to think that could we see minus 0.2 each month for the remainder of the year. And it's not completely ridiculous even if we didn\u2019t see minus 0.2, if we saw something worse than like November, December. We're still going to end up in a pretty decent place within that 2.1 to 2.3 decline range.", "One other point just to preempt answer that, we may get from someone. Our carryover for next year, if we hit the 2.1 scenario would be positive 0.1 for the full year. Right so, if we finish the year October, November, December down 0.2 each months sequentially that gives us the full year 2.1 decline, and our carryover would go into the next year would actually be slightly positive. On the flipside just to be fair, if we finish with the down 2.3 scenario, our carryover next year would be minus 0.9%. Not an incredible headwind to overcome in order to get the positive rate, but certainly in the current environment that would be a tougher starting point, but still one that doesn\u2019t make 2017 a complete wash. So that math is what gives me confidence George in saying that we are going to be in that 2.1 to 2.3 range that we gave", "George Tong", "Very helpful. Thank you, Mike and Bill. Just housekeeping question around the guidance. Free cash flow guidance is increasing by about 100 million but EBITDA going up by 50 million. Can you talk about where that bridge is coming from in terms of cash flow?", "Michael Kneeland", "Sure. To be clear the EBITDA guidance range, the bottom of that range end up, it went up by 50 million. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s exactly accurate to say EBITDA guidance went up 50 million. But try to be a little bit more helpful of the 100 million or so increase in our free cash flow guidance, the bulk of it was driven by of refine in our view of working capital uses during the course of the year and a reduction in our view about how much non-rental CapEx were going to spent over the course of the year. That working capital, there is a contribution from accounts receivable and the contribution from timing of payables and the non-rental CapEx was just a refinement in our view about what is that we\u2019re going to spend in the way of leasehold improvements and non-rental assets like delivery trucks and service trucks. So working capital and non-rental CapEx were the primary drivers of that improvement.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mili Pothiwala from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.", "Mili Pothiwala", "Thanks. My question is on M&A. So, you\u2019ve been pretty clear about your priorities here and your preference for specialty. But I guess as you look at the industry, do you see scope for further consolidation in this end market environment i.e., could this be away for some of your larger competitors to gain share?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is Mike. M&A has always been part of our overview and strategy. It really comes down to timing. It comes down to price. It comes down to two individuals coming together and agreeing. But yes, we think consolidation will continue to play out overtime within our industry. Timing is always one where you don\u2019t always hit to pick and choose your time, but we have, we\u2019re very, I would say very discipline in our approach of how we go about it. So, there is a lot of things that we look at and we\u2019re pretty stringent as to the hurdles that we have to go forward. So, I'd say it will continue. There will be further consolidation in our industry overtime.", "Mili Pothiwala", "I guess how would you rate the pipeline right now just kind of trying to hone in on how people are thinking about M&A in the context of the current and market environment? Is there have you noticed any shifts recently?", "Michael Kneeland", "I wouldn\u2019t say shift. Our pipeline is always been full. Our business development teams have been very active creating a lot of communication relationships across the broad spectrum. But our pipeline is there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.", "Nick Coppola", "Bill, In your opening comments, you talk a bit about the cycle, but one if you could add any additional color there relate to customers were positive. It sounds like, what conversation looks like with customers and what is your visibility at this point?", "William Plummer", "Well, I think I articulated in my opening comments and we talked about the Dodge starts and talk about Dodge momentum. To look at, it's been up five for the last six months through the strongest result for us since late 2012 early 2013. The backlog, I think, is another way of looking at it. The backlog is a new peak at 14.1 months on the backlog versus 12.2, and those are the things that we look at that sees the visibility that goes forward. And by the way, we talked about Canada earlier -- even in Canada building permits were up non-res sequentially up 12%. So, we do see a lot of activity that is on horizon. Our customers overall as I mentioned in our opening comments are optimistic. They're seeing the same thing in the build-up of their backlogs.", "Nick Coppola", "And then just wanted to ask on Hurricane Matthew as well, how do you expect that impact your business in Q4 and then in the following quarter?", "William Plummer", "For those you to know me weather has not been one that won't be always hung our hat on. But unfortunately, there was a lot of devastation as I mentioned in Northern Florida, Georgia and the Carolina's. And our people have been there, it's not material for us simply because of our size. We're across all of the U.S. and Canada, and even if you look at what happen in during the Sandy Storm, it wasn\u2019t the material impact. It will take years to recover as they rebuild will say will do, and that will play out overtime.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please.", "Joe O'Dea", "First question is just on, on used equivalent pricing. i think when we look at the reported adjusted margin in the quarter, it was down a little bit sequentially and so maybe to talk about in any channel or next considerations there, but then more broadly just what's you are seeing on more apples-to-apples basis sequentially and how you feel about where things are trending in used equipment prices?", "William Plummer", "Hey, Joe, it's Bill. Don\u2019t think about it sequentially that all has the data from Q2 right here to give you a number I'd certainly on a year-over-year basis talked about the adjusted margin experience being up. If you look at the pricing underneath that margin experience on a year-over-year basis it's certainly down a little bit from last year let's call it 3% on a comparable unit basis maybe it touch 3% to 4% let's say on a year-over-year basis right. So we have been seeing some pricing pressure just on a raw basis year-over-year and that's been the case for a number of months. I think it's encouraging now that we can still move the equipments through the channels that are most attractive and still keep the margins at a pretty attractive level. If you look at pricing relative to the original equipment cost of the fleet that we sold in Q3, I do have that compare to Q2. It wasn\u2019t a significant change right on a sequential basis, price as a percent of OEC, that didn\u2019t change significantly Q2 to Q3. So that might give you a little bit of an indicator of those sequential experience that we had in the fleet. That helped", "Joe O'Dea", "Got it. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Sounds like stabilization sequentially, if you put it in those terms. And then just when we think about the outline you\u2019ve given on 2017 CapEx, 1.2 to 1.6 and I think you talked about how there been no firm decisions there, but could you talk about the planning process, and if where you are in that, when that really hits up. I think some of the tone of your comments today and feeling a little bit more positive about things, it suggests that we see some improvement year-over-year in that but how do you think about that when you will have a firm decision on it and where you are in the planning process?", "William Plummer", "So, I characterize this as being midstream in the planning process. As we said right here and now we\u2019re targeting a presentation of our plan to the Board in December, at least a preliminary presentation and so we\u2019ve got to be finish by then. Right here now as we think about next year. We haven\u2019t put us take in the ground, but our view will certainly be impacted by our view of how well the cycle is developing. And also impacted by our view of how well we\u2019re going to perform and continuing to win major projects and when just general business, go forward. We\u2019re looking at initiatives that they\u2019re going to have impact in 2017 some of which we will talk about at our Investor Day in December.", "And those initiatives the overall cycle and how effective we expected to be are going to determine the end number. What I would say about the range is the range still live of that 2 billion to 6 billion. Yes, at this point, we could end up anywhere in that range. But keep in mind that if we are going to spend more going forward and we\u2019re spending right here now. We decided that we want to have a very clear view of where that spend is gone and how it\u2019s going to contribute to improving our performance as a company before we decide to spend that incremental amount, so more to come as we get closer to the end of the process and into January.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Good morning. I just, I have to ask the digital platform sounds pretty exciting and if you guys could rehash the quantification of the run rate now. What do you think longer term back and get up to I feel that could be a very significant percent of the mix and have you given any thought to SG&A savings on that yet? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "So Scott, this is Mike I\u2019ll start and then please Matt or Bill. Look, we think that as I pointed out in my opening comments, we\u2019re offering way and which our customers can easy to use place our own orders, manage their own business. And this is just a follow on from what we\u2019ve heard from customer overtime. I also believe which we\u2019re very happy to see that about half of that revenue is from new customers. So as we continue to increase the experience for our customers. We think that what we can grab more. Where it goes, I think that\u2019s yet to be determine. But the good thing is, we're on the front curve of that, and there are customers out there who want the simplicity, who want to be able to control, who want to be able to do those orders by themselves. And we want to make sure that experience is there for both of them. Importantly, for us, it's also the stickiness with our current customer base, and so to me, the adding into the new customers is just frosting on the cake. So Matt, Bill?", "Matthew Flannery", "No, I agree with Mike. The customer service aspect of it is primary, and I would say more than an SG&A play, this is more of the broadening your reach play just getting to more customers more new customers then you can get to just knocking on doors and calling on the upsides. And this is just moving into the future, and it's been received very well early days, and we're encourage by that, and hopefully this will open ups the new channels and broaden our reach.", "William Plummer", "Yes, I agree with that. We have not put an SG&A save number to this initiative as of yet, Scott and that's primarily because A; it's very early days. And B; it wasn\u2019t done for SG&A phase, right. It was done to satisfy those customer needs. As this scales and as we start to have a more visibility to the impact than it might have on SG&A, we'll attack the numbers as appropriate go forward. But we haven\u2019t done that as of yet because that's not where we're focused on this initiative.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thank you, Bill. Could you discussed these potential ranges for EBITDA flow through in coming years unless you say based on a flat or rental revenue growth environment, obviously as you mentioned a few questions ago it looks like you are heading into that upcoming year?", "William Plummer", "Yes, the EBITDA flow through we've talked historically about sort of in that 60% area. I think that's still a reasonable range to think about as you have growth sort of significantly different than zero, right. If you are around zero growth, the flow through calculation gets very sensitive and that's quite obviously why we haven\u2019t talked about flow through extensively over the last few quarters. This quarter it was 76% or something like that, but obviously one EBITDA flows could it be lower when you are declining in revenue rather than higher so if that sensitivity of the calculation around zero growth that makes it hard to say much about the usefulness of flow through as a measure when you are around flat. Our plan for next year is to identify opportunities to drive growth. If we drive material growth next year, and I'll think it's ridiculous to think about 60% as a flow through that you could start your modeling with.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Jerry Revich", "Can you folks talk about the cadence of mix as we head into the fourth quarter and early part of 2017, you got to believe a fleet mix benefit that you called out in the EBITDA bridge, and I'm just wondering as we overlay our pricing assumptions anything we should keep in mind as you folks continue the specialty products, should we look for a mixed tailwind, to help offset whatever fleet inflation we dial in to our numbers for next year?", "William Plummer", "Tough one Jerry, and there is so many things going on in that mix line, that it's hard to give you much guidance on how to model it going forward. We\u2019ve got the growth in specialty. We\u2019ve got the Canadian versus U.S. mix effect. We\u2019ve got care class mix and so forth, the mix of day, week and month. So I\u2019m going to dig off of giving you much guidance there because it\u2019s just still so complex. And just ask you to be patient with this as we play out the next several quarters, and ask you to earn your money and forecast to make on your own.", "Jerry Revich", "I appreciate that. And in terms of whether you folks or obviously that ones to look at whether, but other companies are so what we\u2019ve heard is third quarter projects effectively got delayed from whether chance of the Midwest. Is that what\u2019s driving some of the pick-up in the acceleration business on year-over-year basis that you\u2019re seeing in October. So whether better projects are starting to get done, is that playing into what you\u2019re saying in the fourth quarter, what the stronger pick-up in utilization compared to normal seasonality?", "William Plummer", "No Jerry, I wouldn\u2019t really see that\u2019s been a major factor have been delays on some jobs, but I wouldn\u2019t delays whether, I delayed some supply chain and maybe other issues. But the good news is the demand is strong and it\u2019s carried well into October here which is good for us. And just to add, I know the mix answer your more mathematically, but I would say it\u2019s a good opportunity to remind everybody effect strategically we\u2019re still very committed to growing high return project specialty and cross-selling those projects not only for revenue reasons, but also for service reasons to our customers. The more solutions we can provide for them, we just feel that makes us a better partner for them, I\u2019ll take that mix opportunity to promote that strategic view.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session in today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. And listen everybody; I hope you please feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, Head of our IR here in Stamford at any time to answer any additional questions, to see any of our sites, to get any kind of a tour. I hope you will listen and/or attend our Analyst Day in December 1st as well. So look forward to seeing you all there. Thank you very much and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Please be advised that this call is being recorded. Before we begin, note that the Company\u2019s press release, comments made on today\u2019s call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the Company\u2019s earnings release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as subsequent filings with the SEC.

Please refer to the back of the Company\u2019s earnings release and Investor Presentation, to see the reconciliation from each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I would now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. Before we begin, I want to mention that our prepared remarks this morning will include some comments by Matt, and he'll talk about the field operations and give you a progress report on the NES integration. And then Bill will discuss the numbers before we go over to Q&A.", "So here we are in 2017 and I'm pleased that we reported such a strong start to the year. In January, I described 2017 as a critical period in terms of both positioning ourselves with our broader customer base and driving new efficiencies in our operations, and we're executing well on both fronts.", "Many of the actions we took in the quarter were designed to strengthen our earning power in future periods. This includes finalizing the NES transaction, which we closed as planned on April 3. Internally, I'm impressed how quickly our combined workforce has adopted the mindset of a single team, and customer reaction to the acquisition has been positive.", "So I want to take this opportunity to publicly welcome more than a thousand new employees to United Rentals family. They are great addition to the team. We also got off to a solid start on Project XL in the quarter. Six of the eight work streams have now moved past the pilot stage, and we are pleased with the early progress. We have confidence in our EBITDA run rate target of $200 million by year-end of 2018.", "At the same time, we are keeping our focus on immediate results. Demand is on the rise and we captured a lot of that business in the first quarter. Our revenue increased 4.4% year-over-year on a 7% increase in volume. That\u2019s the strongest quarterly increase on volume we've seen in a while. We are also efficient with our fleet. Time utilization came in at 66%, a record high for the first quarter and we generated a solid $490 million of free cash flow.", "Rental rates remains under pressure, down 1.4% year-over-year due mainly to market dynamics. And while this was disappointing and a bit below our expectations, we're encouraged by the trends that continue to point to an industry-wide right-sizing of supply and demand. And this should continue to absorb excess fleet to the marketplace, which is positive for us.", "Matt will talk about this in greater detail, but for a variety of reasons I want to emphasize that I am confident rates will head in the right direction as we work through our busy season. For our part, we plan to spend about $1.5 billion of CapEx this year and given the positive market trends and our commitment to growing our specialty offerings, we feel comfortable with that number and it should match up well against the demand.", "As you know, we issued new guidance yesterday primarily to account for the combination with NES. It includes a nine-month EBITDA contribution of $135 million from the acquired operations. The increase in free cash flow reflects both the impact of the acquisition and our expectation for higher cash generation in the base business. In other words, excluding NES, we are reaffirming our standalone guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and CapEx and increasing our guidance for free cash flow.", "Well here some of the drivers behind our expected performance. Most forecasters are looking at solid growth in the U.S. of rental industry in 2017. Our customers and employees are very good about their prospects this year. Our customer optimism index in March was the highest we've seen since 2014. Demand is trending up in our core construction and industrial sectors, commercial construction remained strong. There is a nice inflection with upstream oil and gas with our macro is improving, and the worst of the drag from Canada appears to be behind us.", "In addition, the vertical sales strategy we put in place is working. Infrastructure is a great example. Our revenue from infrastructure was up almost 5% in the quarter and a down sector. Our digital presence is growing as well. In the first quarter, we had a 15% sequential growth in online rental transactions and we gained over a 1,100 new customers in those three months alone.", "And finally, our specialty segment, Trench, Power and Pump continuously outpace the company as a whole. These three operations combined were up almost 17% in the quarter versus the prior year. We opened three cold starts through March, bringing our specialty network to 217 total branches in North America, with the plan to open at least 17 branches this year.", "Even with the steady expansion of our footprint, the bulk of our growth in specialty comes from same-store at higher margins in our gen rent operations. They make the strong case for continued investment in this segment. Specialty also benefits from cross-selling with our gen rent branches, specialty revenue and cross-selling to national accounts grew by almost 12% in the quarter, first quarter versus a year-ago and cross-selling our fleet started years ago as a way to boost returns on assets now has become one of our most valuable core competencies.", "So in closing the year is off to a strong start. NES acquisition was finalized on schedule and integration is on track. We have numerous avenues for growth, with positive momentum across the board. Our branches and our customers are optimistic about the prospects and our confidence on the cycle remains intact.", "So with that as a backdrop, I\u2019m going to ask Matt to update you on the operations and also on the NES integration. So over to you, Matt.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thanks Mike. I'm going to start with NES, because I know there's a lot of interest in the integration, and it's obviously early days, but things are moving along, consistent with our aggressive schedule. We believe that speed is a key to alleviate uncertainties for the team. We've already finalized the leadership decisions and incorporated the NES managers and branches and stores into our region district network.", "And last only nine days after close, we converted every new location over to our Rental Management System, the acquired fleet and the customer histories are visible in the system and we're already seeing the team used this data share fleet and they're also passing along leads to meet market demand. This is very encouraging so early on.", "And we're still going through a thoughtful evaluation of our combined footprint, some changes will be necessary. So we want to make sure we get it right, we're going to take some more time of that. And most importantly, we've made the team's top priority to focus on serving our customers and they're really coming through on that front. The next several months, we'll be unlocking the full potential of the combination. Since announcing our plan to acquire any effect January, we've been able to take a much deeper dive into their operations.", "And I'm glad to report that the first quarter results performed largely as we expect, we continue to feel good about the cost synergies that we put out there in January. We believe that we're on track to deliver a run rate of about $40 million of incremental EBITDA in year two and the same goes for our revenue synergies, where we\u2019re still targeting $35 million by year three. And then the near-term, the combined company has an immediate benefit to our business. And as Mike mentioned, our new guidance reflects what we expect for the balance of this year.", "Now, I want to look back at the first quarter to give you a quick tour of our operating landscape. There were a lot of commonalities across our regions fueled by demand in core projects. These include stadiums and resorts, data centers and factories as well as bridges and power plants. And the demand in the quarter was not only strong, but it was broad.", "[ROIC] on rent trended up in over three quarters of the U.S. states and eight out of the 10 Canadian provinces. That's a sign of a healthy operating environment. Regionally, we continue to see the strongest growth along the eastern seaboard in the West Coast, as well as some of the South Central states. And another strong highlight was our Pump Solutions business, which grew rental revenue by more than 20% year-over-year and almost all of that growth with same-store reflecting our cross-selling efforts, our gains and market share and an underlying improvement in our end markets.", "And we've been executing a diversification strategy for pump for the past two years, so it's nice to see that paying off. We\u2019ve always had big plans for pump. We never saw it strictly as an oil and gas acquisition. But as the upstream sector continues to recover, it's giving this business an extra bounce.", "Now, I want to take a minute to discuss rates, which are obviously front and center to both our investors and our employees. While there are challenges in certain markets, on balance, we are encouraged by what we are seeing. First, as I mentioned, demand is strong and broad-based. You could see the momentum build across the first quarter in our monthly time utilization and as best we can tell our peers saw similar strength. We believe it's been a trend for the past six months or so and this dynamic has got that positive implication for rates going forward.", "Another factor is seasonality. It's never easy to get rate in the first quarter. This is our seasonal trough in demand. That being said, we delivered a better sequential improvement in the first quarter of this year than last year. And if you look at the trajectory of our sequential and year-over-year rates across the quarter it's certainly suggests an ongoing absorption.", "And finally, and let me be absolutely clear about this, our strategic focus on rate has not changed. I personally discussed the importance of rate integrity with our field leaders and they are keenly aware of how important this is to our business and our ability to serve our customers. All of these things taken together give me confidence that rates have the potential to get better in the back half of the year and that's the point I really want to emphasize this morning.", "So we are getting to gain time for our field operations. We are entering our busiest period with a bigger talent pool, a more extensive branch network, a larger fleet and many new customers to serve. And our employees know the goal post and it's a point of pride for them to get us there. So if you have any questions about operations, I'll be happy to answer them during Q&A.", "Right now, I'm going to hand it over to Bill for the financial review. Bill?", "William Plummer", "Thanks Matt, and good morning to everybody. I got a lot to go through, so I\u2019ll dive right in starting with rental revenue. The $49 million year-over-year change in rental revenue was up 4.4% and the components of that $49 million start with ancillary and re-rent revenue that combined was up $12 million and really that was driven by ancillary revenues associated with higher volume, delivery fees in particular, but also fuel recovery for rental. So strong quarter driven by high volume and you hear that throughout a number of the comments that will make volumes a huge part of the story in the quarter.", "In owned equipment revenue, volume contributed $68 million over last year, but $14 million of that went the other way against rate and then replacement CapEx inflation took another $16 million versus last year. Mix and other was relatively flat in the quarter, only $1 million of headwind, so those are the pieces of the $49 million increase and that certainly suggests and ties to the notion that volume was a very strong contributor this quarter.", "If you move to used equipment sales, $106 million of proceeds in the quarter that was down $9 million from last year and that reflects just the volume of used equipment sales that we did in the quarter is nothing more than volume. Actually if you look at pricing, pricing was a positive, pricing improved, and that led to an improvement in our adjusted gross margin.", "The margin was up 2.2 percentage points compared to last year to 50.9% in the quarter continue to market and how we're able to sell equipment that in this case was almost 90 months old at something like 51% of the original cost of that equipment, so very robust used equipment market that we're selling into.", "Moving to adjusted EBITDA $591 million of adjusted EBITDA $7 million improvement of last year at 43.6% margin. The components of that change $46 million of volume, but rental rates taking $13 million against that fleet inflation down $11 million, used equipment sales you can see the GP impact was $3 million of headwind versus last year. Our usual merit increase in that $5 million to $6 million ranges so call it $5 million in the quarter and then $7 million of mix and other and included within that $7 million was about $3 million from the year-over-year increase in our bonus accrual.", "I call that out, because we've talked previously about the bonus accrual in the full-year of 2017 going up materially from last year it was $3 million of increase in the first quarter, those year-over-year impacts will increase in subsequent quarters because of the timing of when we adjusted our bonus accruals last year versus our expectation that we'll continue to accrue at 100% payout for this year.", "So those are the pieces of the $7 million of year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA, the 43.6% margin was down a point from last year and really that reflects the impact of rental rates actually if you just adjusted out the rental rate impact in adjusted EBITDA you get back to flat with last year's margin.", "On adjusted EPS, we had $1.63 results in the quarter that's up from $1.40 last year and it reflects the improvement in operating performance, but also lower interest expense from both a lower debt balance and some of the restructuring that we've done. It also reflected the impact of our tax expense going down as we adopted new guidance on how we treat stock-based compensation and it's now recognized in the tax line as opposed to direct adjustments to the balance sheet item.", "So that stock-based compensation guidance benefited us by about $0.09 in the $1.63 quarter. EPS was also benefit in the quarter by the reduction in share count as a result of our share repurchases since last year about 5.6 million fewer shares this year compared to first quarter last year.", "On free cash flow $490 million of free cash flow in the quarter, it's a very strong first quarter although down from last year. Last year was 137 million higher in the first quarter but that change primarily reflects the difference in net rental CapEx spend in this year compared to last year. Last year was a very, very restraint CapEx spend in the first quarter.", "The cash flow impact brought our net debt balance at the end of the quarter down to $7 billion and that's $520 million less debt than we had last year, so pretty significant improvement in the absolute quantum of debt that we have outstanding as a Company. I do know that that $7 billion number had not yet included the impact of actually acquiring our NES if you add back the NES funding as we sit today we're at about $7.9 billion of net debt on yesterday's close.", "Liquidity finished the quarter at $2.1 billion that included $1.7 billion of ABL capacity and little over $300 million of cash on the balance sheet and again those are higher balances for our liquidity sources because it was in advance of the NES acquisition. If you look at it today, we sit at about $1.2 billion after the NES close.", "Rental CapEx you saw the $219 million in the quarter that's up from a very depressed level of rental CapEx spend last year and the net rental CapEx change year-over-year just reflects the difference and that gross number plus the difference in net proceeds from used equipment sales.", "Let me finish out \u2013 spend a little time on our guidance. As we noted in the press release and Michael's comments, we have updated the guidance to include the impact of NES. For the underlying URI performance, this guidance reflects no change in most of the metrics with the exception of free cash flow, which we have increased.", "The changes for NES reflect \u2013 obviously owning the business for nine months and they do include the impact of synergies realized or expected to be realized in 2017, both the cost synergies and the net of any revenue dissynergies and synergies that we might realized.", "So just to be clear the impacts that we added were $300 million in revenue and $135 million in adjusted EBITDA. We did put in an extra $50 million to cover gross rental CapEx for the remainder of the year at NES and those were the real changes to the exact guidance components.", "On free cash flow, we added $150 million to our prior guidance that reflects the addition of NES plus some improvement in the cash tax position of the underlying United Rentals operation. So NES, if you just add the EBITDA of $135 million subtract $50 million cash flow for CapEx subtract $30 million from the incremental interest expense that we carry for the debt of acquiring NES and then add a $100 million of improvement in cash taxes, you get to that $150 million increase.", "And within that $100 of cash tax improvement, about 50 of it came from the NES acquisition, either from applying the NOLs that we acquired with NES or from the deduction available for deal-related expenses that that in aggregate added about $50 million to cash tax benefit.", "The other $50 million is from adjustments and estimates that we've made on the underlying United Rentals business as we've gotten a sharper view of what our cash tax picture will look like on the legacy business. So those are the pieces of the $100 million cash impact or cash tax impact that led us too partially to the increase in free cash flow guidance.", "Just one last point on NES, we haven't changed any of our views, as we said before about the synergies that we went into, thinking about this deal with one exception. The NOLs that we acquired that we had announcement take that present value of about $150 million. We\u2019ve looked at that more closely as we've worked with the NES folks in tax and evaluated the positions that they've taken and that we can take going forward.", "We now believe that those NOLs will have a higher present value than what we initially thought something like $150 million instead of the $125 million that we initially thought. So that's a little nugget that we found that that gives us more confidence about the value of the NES acquisition.", "I think I\u2019ll stop there and will address either questions about these or anything else that you all are interested in hearing in Q&A. So I'll ask the operator to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Thein from Citi Research. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "William Plummer", "Hi, Tim.", "Timothy Thein", "Good morning. Just a first question maybe Matt, you could just put a little bit more color around your earlier comments in terms of your confidence in terms of rate improvement as you get into the second half of the year, presumably you're talking year-over-year, but maybe you could just flesh out kind of the dynamics between sequential versus year-over-year rate?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure, so I think you might have seen it in the release last night, but you could see both from a year-over-year perspective and a sequential perspective, the negative tempered some as we went through the quarter and we find that encouraging when you combine that with the time utilization that we achieved and we believe that the industry is seeing a similar progression and it maybe not the same relevant number, but a similar progression all that points to the opportunity for us to be able to realize rate improvement in the back half of the year.", "Now that improvement, first we have to start with sequential. We are not sure that the slow first start would allow us to get to positive rate on a year-over-year basis. But if you wanted the model what that would take and we're not forecasting, it would be a healthy half a point sequential improvement through our peak months of May through October. So that it would take to get flat.", "We don't know if that's there or not, but I think the point we really wanted to get across is the demand is there, which is very, very strong and it's really about if this absorption continues and the industry continues to see the opportunity we are hopeful that will realize itself in the better rate performance than we had in Q1. Q1 was certainly a little softer than we had expected.", "William Plummer", "Let me just add one factual point, I don\u2019t think everybody has the progression of year-over-year, we didn't put in our investor deck, so January, year-over-year was minus 1.8, February was minus 1.5, March was minus 0.9, and so that progression along with the sequential progression I think is sort of evidence that we think the absorption will help move us in the right direction and supports the comments that Matt made.", "Timothy Thein", "Okay. Would you care to kind of extend this forward a couple weeks in terms of what you've seen thus far in April?", "Michael Kneeland", "As you know Tim, we've gotten out of the business of\u2026", "Timothy Thein", "Yes, okay.", "Michael Kneeland", "Talking prospectively about rates, so we'll beg off, thanks.", "Timothy Thein", "Okay. Understood. And just through more definitional, but will there be any meaning or should we expect any meaningful impact on URI rates as you fold the NES contracts or is that \u2013 is it kind of de minimis or what impact if any on URI rates will have as you fold that businesses?", "William Plummer", "Yes. We'll talk about that more when we got the data at the second quarter. I don't think it's any surprise to say that when we add NES rates, we will be adding rates that are below sort of the rate level that United Rentals has historically achieved. So that will have an impact of adding lower rates on that portion of the business, but the impact we believe will lessen, as we gradually manage rates in the way that we overall manage rates at United Rentals.", "So we'll talk more about the impact there to the extent that we can't once we've got the actual data in front of us, but it will be at lower rates and then migrate those rates in the way that we normally would manage them from there.", "Michael Kneeland", "I think additionally Tim to Bill\u2019s comments is the opportunity to cross sell into that customer base, it can help defray some of the separation and just putting the tools, as Bill said in the hands of the employees to be able to have a broader offering to sell the customers would be very healthy.", "Timothy Thein", "Okay. I appreciate the time. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.", "David Raso", "Hi, good morning. On rates geographically, the split between U.S. and Canada. Obviously, Canada has been a drag, if you can just give us that exact split and then within the U.S. or other territories where rate is already positive, we are just trying to figure out how much is this certain pockets are dragging the rate down or is it still very broad across the U.S.?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure. Dave, this is Matt. For your first part of your question, if we had pulled Canada out, our 1.4 year-over-year rate decline would have been 1.0, so closer to normal, what we had expected in Q1. And as far as region, I won\u2019t guess specific regions, but we had a couple of regions that were positive year-over-year rate in Q1 and really not many of them were planned to be positive in Q1 because that's a seasonal trough.", "The challenge came in some of the markets, there were a handful of markets that we're just drag this down and we \u2013 it's very \u2013 it's identifiable areas that we think seasonally we can help them improve if not we\u2019re going to move flight out of there into the markets that can support, the environment can support a better result.", "David Raso", "And when it comes to the cadence of standalone URI\u2019s CapEx, is there been any impact on trying to focus on rate on the timing of fleet going into the field.", "Michael Kneeland", "Not as of yet David, it's still early days to make that decision. Certainly, as Matt said, we're looking at where that CapEx goes once we spend it. But we haven't yet got to the point of saying we need to make a significant change in the timing of the CapEx. We're going to monitor that very closely. This month, next month are important month, so I would say stay tune and we can talk about in more detail in the second quarter.", "David Raso", "And then while you've sort of given the marching orders to focus on the right here a little bit with your branch managers and regional managers, has there been anything officially instituted on pushing rate differently than the constant tweaking that you always do on supply demand in every region?", "William Plummer", "Yes. There has been some strategies that we've employed, some that have been used in the past, some new and like always it's disseminating that information all the way down to the field network and I think we've done that effectively. I think that was frankly started mid-February which when we saw January come softer that's where you saw the trend start to turn.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, David. This is Mike. I would just tell you that we don't rest. We continually do learn through our analytics on ways in which we become better and how we manage, how we can communicate that throughout the organization. So it is still \u2013 we'll always be whatever always hoping and looking at ways to improve it.", "David Raso", "And I guess lastly, Canada rental revenues for the quarter appear to may have gotten back to flattish. The rate going forward in Canada, how would you frame currently down mathematically over 5% given the impact you implied for the whole Company. What kind of rate performance should we expect for rest of the year in Canada? I know we are not going to get back to flat for the full-year, but just trying to get a feel for Canada can get close to flat as the year goes on, maybe what the impact could be?", "Matthew Flannery", "Yes. Again, we've gotten out of the business of speculating too much about what rates could be, what I would say is that Canada \u2013 certainly we're encouraged by the strength that we're seeing in the eastern part of country, the flattening of what we've seen in the western part of the country, right, we believe it's trough. And so that will encourage improved rate performance in Canada. But when you're down over 5% in the first quarter, you've got some work to do in order to flatten later in the year. So I'd just suggested that we talk about as we go through the year.", "David Raso", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks Dave.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe O'Dea", "Hi, good morning. Could you just talk about when you see transitions and demand historically, how you think about leading indicators and where we see the strength in the used equipment prices, we see the strength in utilization, clearly some surprise on rate, but how you think about the progression of those and a typical lag and whether rate would typically lag and how long that would be?", "Michael Kneeland", "Joe, this is Mike. I've always said that throughout my career that when you see these prices improve is step one and then as you look at utilization. And as Matt mentioned about the absorption of the fleet, we all so secret that when we went to the oil and the surrounding markets \u2013 surrounding our market that was a surplus of fleet, that is being absorbed. And then as the industry begins to achieve better performance on utilization, it's confidence towards rate.", "Throughout my career I've seen that. Is there any given cadence. It's not a science, it's just something that happens that I have experienced and that's kind of what gives us some confidence based on the demand that we're seeing and how our employees who are straight on the field as well as our customers, the optimism they have for the remainder of this year into next.", "Joe O'Dea", "And then what is your sense for \u2013 maybe why we didn't see rate react more quickly? Is there just a general wait and see in terms of confidence and sustainability of some of the improved demand, it\u2019s promising to see that the rest of the industry also appears to be seeing a similar progression of improving utilization, but just why the industry would be a little bit apprehensive to run with that and set to flow through rates?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, again it goes back to the absorption and time utilization, they start to see it, number one, if you take a look at where we are the sequential this year versus last year, albeit some a disappointing, it still improvement. The time utilization is one that gives us better confidence and as we talk to David, the rate impact in Canada 5.3%. Canada is on secret that as bought more commodities driven economy suffered during last year and started the level off and seeing time utilization improve there as well at the same time inflection of the rate I would say that there is opportunity as we go forward. Again it's building a confidence with inside the industry by utilizing the fleet that they have.", "William Plummer", "Joe, I think you hit on early on, when you said the rate is a leading indicator, it\u2019s not \u2013 the time utilization excuse me is a leading indicator. And I think that we're seeing, you just have to remember the seasonal drop that we spoke about. We have to go back all away to 2014, where we didn't have negative sequential rate in Q1 and even then they were fairly close to flat, when I remember looking at them last time. So it's part of it seasonal and we are really encouraged by the leading indicator that you pointed to a time utilization be enough or should help us ramp up.", "Joe O'Dea", "It\u2019s helpful, and then maybe just one more on kind of end markets and specifically, anything that you're seeing in Industrial and I think that tends to be more MRO related, but have you seen some an improvement in activity there and specifically in the industries or sectors that you would call out within Industrial?", "Michael Kneeland", "I think within Industrial, I think we're still at the point of looking at the timing of some of the downstream oil and gas, turnarounds that may have been postponed. So I wouldn't point to improvement there just yet, but in other Industrial segments. I think there are pockets that you can look at that it felt on a little better than they had in the past.", "So we continue to see some aerospace related for example and they\u2019re probably some other pockets, but that we could call out there going to be important and try to be even talk in the same time, which is never a good thing. But for example, paper and forest products is \u2013 power is one that, but I'd like to pharmaceuticals, biotech we've actually had couple of industrial manufacturing oriented businesses that have done better. So a little bit of green shoots in some of the industrial areas, but it hasn't developed into a powerful way just yet.", "William Plummer", "Yes, when you look at the 7% growth obviously any offsets to some of the verticals and industrial that that might have depth and some one that might have call flat overall, really the non-res market pick it up strong and that really help drive that 7% volume growth.", "Joe O'Dea", "Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks very much.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer from Barclays. Your question please.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Yes, good morning. I wonder if you just go back to SG&A for a minute and you talked about some of the compensation increase SG&A where you've had it that high and past 1Q is relative to sales was a little higher than we thought. So wondering can you maybe clarify how much of the compensation bump was unique to 1Q versus evenly spread throughout the year and was there anything else in 1Q really that you would call on SG&A that may that higher than you might have thought?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, so what I get just a couple of pieces out. So the $16 million if I recall year-over-year increase. Within that I called out the $3 million bonus and in addition to that, there was 7 million of stock compensation expense increase separate apart from the bonus that the cash bonus that we pay out. And again that $7 million reflects the change in accounting guidance about how the stock compensation expense is treated. But it also reflects, primarily reflects the fact that our stock price went up tremendous amount in quarter and so that increase shows up as stock compensation expense in the quarter.", "Now it comes out of adjusted EBITDA, it's wide and called out as a component of year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA, but it was about $7 million of the $15 million, $16 million increase that we saw in the quarter. The other $4million, $5 million or so were really timing items among pro fees, T&E and some other in this and that, but those are the big jump.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Thank you. And then it does. But I'm sorry for not understanding, but does that stock compensation increase repeat across the quarters or is it more lumpy in 1Q due to timing of grants or exercises or accounting?", "Michael Kneeland", "It's more lumpy in 1Q just because of the timing of when our stock compensation awards are made and when they vest, you have to adjust for the stock price at that point, at the vesting point. So the bulk of that $7 million impact will be in the first quarter, been this and that as we go through the rest of the year just based on other awards that are granted, yes, that's going to be the biggest jump.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.", "Ross Gilardi", "Yes. Good morning. Thanks guys. I just want to ask about the Project XL and the $200 million of savings. Are you having to put costs into the business to generate those savings, we would look at that as a kind of a gross or net number?", "William Plummer", "So the $200 million run rate is going to be a net number. We do have to put some cost into the business in order to achieve some of the initiatives that we do, but when we talk about that run rate achievement, it's going to be the net. So for example, if we're focusing on another service line to our customers, customer equipment \u2013 servicing customer equipment is one example. You got to have service tax able to do the work. So that's an example of the expense that will come in, but the net impact is what we're tracking in that $200 million.", "Ross Gilardi", "When do you think we'll see it, I mean is it going to be like heavily kind of weighted towards the back half of 2018, is that more of like a run rate by the end of 2018 or should we \u2013 and where should we see, as you see our SG&A all the sudden start to go down of the fair amount?", "William Plummer", "So for the win I think, well, first to be exclusive the $200 million is the end of 2018 run rate, that's how we're stating the impact of the program overall, but you'll start to see impacts as we go through 2017, and it will be weighted a little bit more heavily in 2018 than it is in 2017, but you'll start to see some impacts later this year and those impacts should show in a variety of areas.", "A number of the initiatives are revenue driven and so you would see the impact in topline, but we do have initiatives. For example, we've got a G&A focused initiatives that is pure cost that would show up in SG&A and have others that are mix of revenue and costs. So, I think it would be best \u2013 let us get more data out there and then we can talk a little bit more specifically about where to see the impact. And that will come later this year as we get the reporting package defined in the way that we feel confidence talking about externally.", "Ross Gilardi", "Okay. In the past you guys have expressed some confidence that you could still do like a 60%-ish type incremental margin in a flattish rate environment. Not to put words in your mouth, I wanted to just clarify that first. And do you still \u2013 if I have that right, you still sort of feel that way on the back of this quarter.", "William Plummer", "Yes, I think if we had a flat rate environment, I think we could be in the neighborhood of 60%, it requires us to be able to do some other things in the business that improved productivity. But I think we've be within hailing distance of 60% just with pure flat rate.", "So still feel that there are opportunities in the business to do that especially you would have to have a business growing for example. Right, you can't say that when the business is declining. You would have to have some productivity focused initiatives, you can't just rest on your laurels and say 50% is going to fall in your lap, but flat rate gets us in the neighborhood.", "Ross Gilardi", "And just lastly, what are you assuming on the high-end and low-end of your EBITDA guide in terms of the NES cost synergies that you've outlined over the next several years for 2017?", "William Plummer", "So I think a reasonable range to think about for NES cost synergies realized this year is in that $10 million to $15 million range. So the range that we've given should encompass that kind of range on cost synergies.", "Ross Gilardi", "Got it. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "You bet.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your question please.", "Adrian Paz", "Hi. This is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. In regards to the NES synergies, can you provide a bit more detail on where the synergies will come from and also perhaps timing on how you expect those synergies to ramp?", "William Plummer", "So maybe I will start on the cost side and Matt if you want you can address the cross-sell. Yes, on the cost, it's good old fashion cost synergies, right, it's about G&A expense represented by wage and benefits and pro fees and T&E and all the basic things that you get at that are duplicative between NES and legacy United Rentals, so we will be addressing those as we go through the year.", "There's also \u2013 the 40 million that we guided to fully developed run rate or fully developed synergies. There's also some branch consolidations that's included in there. And as Matt said in his comments, we want to be very mindful, and thoughtful about when and where and whether we have been branch consolidations, but we assume there would be some just because of the overlap of the network. So those are the main sources on the cost side. And on the revenue side, Matt if you want to offer anything?", "Michael Kneeland", "I would just say that in the revenue side, certainly you could see from more commentary that it\u2019s more back loaded. It will take more time to cross sell into the customers. The first step is to stabilize the customers, make those that have any overlap with us, feel comfortable that they don't need a second supplier and then after that we'll start selling our additional product offerings to the team. So that's why you'll see the revenue synergies be more back loaded.", "Adrian Paz", "And on timing, how do you expect those synergies to ramp in 2017 and also 2018?", "Matthew Flannery", "You mean, metric or you mean timing?", "Adrian Paz", "On timing, when you expect to see the synergies go through.", "Matthew Flannery", "So embedded in the updated guidance that we just gave including NES is how we see this will play out for this year. And then from there we probably will hold until we absorb a lot of the opportunities and challenges and give you more information maybe in the next quarter. The $195 million EBITDA that we gave out as the thesis for the deal still stands firm in our minds.", "Adrian Paz", "And in regards to rate, do you believe rate pressure is the largely reflecting the energy headwinds, or do you see them as maybe the industry adding fleet too quickly, any additional context on fleet dynamics would be helpful?", "Matthew Flannery", "Well, I actually think the industry has done a pretty good job on the absorption and not bringing the fleet to quickly. If that continues, that's why you'll hear on more positive tone on us about the forward look as opposed to what we experienced in Q1. So I'm not worried about that. And I mean we spoke about it. Demand is what we think is going to drive this thing. I don\u2019t know Bill if you have anything to add.", "William Plummer", "That\u2019s it.", "Adrian Paz", "Thank you.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hey, Seth.", "Seth Weber", "Hey, good morning, guys. How are you?", "Michael Kneeland", "Good.", "Seth Weber", "Sorry, going back to the confidence and the rates moving in the right direction, again? Do you anticipate any change in project type, more project versus MRO? Or any change in customer mix on national versus local that's helping you get more confidence in that or is it just really to appear I think demand is good, supply-demand balance is going to get better throughout the year?", "Michael Kneeland", "We may get some lift from it. We may even get some lift from product mix, which is a continued focus of ours as you see through our specialty growth. But I would say the big driver here is the basic blocking and it\u2019s not tackling of selling the full product offering in the demand gives us that opportunity. So demand will be a big one that will move that and we really feel good about that.", "William Plummer", "I would say its broad based.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes.", "Seth Weber", "Okay, sorry, just going back to the cost side, the bonus accrual discussion. I mean is that \u2013 so I think a mobile, you called out $3 million in the first quarter. So I think that's going to get larger as we go through the year. I mean it sounds like you're going to get some benefit from Project XL and things like that. So I'm just trying to kind of net all these things together.", "At the end of the day, does some of this XL benefit get wiped out by some of these other costs that are going to be accelerating in the model this year or just is there any way to kind of understand the slope of some of these costs that are coming in versus the savings that are going the other way?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, hard to guide you at precise level here is that on the bonus accrual I think the answer. I said that it will be expanding as we go forward. I think we said in the first quarter that the full-year impact if we finish this year at 100% payout over last year would be $27 billion if I remember correctly. And so we got three of that in the first quarter.", "So I think if you started out just saying, okay the remaining $24 million will come equally over the next three quarters that will give you at least a starting point on that line. Stock compensation expense, we talked about that being heavily focused on first quarter, so you might just assume a smaller amount in subsequent quarters.", "The timing items pro fees, T&E and some others, it's hard to figure out how to give you much guidance on what to do with those items as we go through the year because there will be some impacts on Project XL probably not huge, but some. And it certainly is something that's hard to figure out how to give you more guidance. All of that's embedded in our guidance overall, the total Company guidance that I understand your question is being more focused on the particular line of SG&A and maybe some other particular line.", "Seth Weber", "Yes, okay, we can follow-up on off-line. And then just one last one, now that the deal is closed, any thoughts about the share repurchases if you restart that or do you kind of need to get through more of this integration before you feel comfortable doing that?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, get through more of the integration will come back to as we get probably, I\u2019ve talked about this, so I'm living dangerously right now, but probably get through the second quarter and it's sort of in the third quarter when we can reengage the discussion. I think that will give us a good four months of seeing how the integrations going and making sure that it's played out the way we thought getting a better handle on how cash flows evolving this year and then we'll consider it and decide whether we want to do something where we want to wait a little longer.", "Seth Weber", "Okay, thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Yes. Good morning, guys.", "Matthew Flannery", "Good morning.", "Nicole DeBlase", "So just one, I need to go back on rate because it sounds like that you\u2019ve been spending a lot of the Q&A on this. But I guess the one thing that I didn't hear you answer, it is just from a competitive perspective, what you guys are seeing on our peers or competitors behaving rationally or are you seeing some increased competitive pressure, which is adding to the rates decline?", "Matthew Flannery", "It depends on the market in the markets where we're seeing the demand being the strongest and our performance being stronger. We're seeing similar behavior by most of our competitors. And in the markets where it's a challenge and we're not able to get what we want, I\u2019d say it's exacerbated by the other folks that are living through that same reality.", "So it's not really too different from what we've experienced in the past, the difference that we feel this year versus let's say last year is the demand is much stronger. This feels like a much different although numerically, you can look at sequentials and talk [yourself into] it similar, this feels much different coming out of this Q1, coming out of Q1 last year and I don't imagine that same dynamics not playing through for our competitors. I think it is. I think they probably feel much better coming out of Q1 this year as well.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay. Thanks, Matt. That's helpful. And then just nitpicky one, your tax rate was low this quarter and you talked about stock comp is the reason why. I know that the stock comp is a lumpy issue and SG&A for the first quarter. Is it also a lumpy issue in the tax rate and we should expect a bump up again in the second quarter and beyond?", "Michael Kneeland", "I think if you look at the full-year, we still think that we'll be somewhere in that 37%, 38% tax rate. So it will be more of an impact in the first quarter than it will over the remainder of the year.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Matthew Flannery", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Jordan from Jefferies. Your question please.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hi, Justin.", "Justin Jordan", "Good morning. Just one thing just going through the slide decks, on Slide 15 you change the basis of which you are showing your top 1000 accounts, the diversified account base slide. I'm just curious; it looks like key accounts are 71% of revenue. I'm just curious what you've done there and equally \u2013 I know we\u2019re [indiscernible] about regular time, but within what you're seeing in terms of the rate development is difference between rates that you're achieving on key accounts versus the unassigned accounts. I'm sort of implying a greater pressure within rate on key accounts?", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes. Justin, this is Mike. I am going to ask Ted to start \u2013 answer part of your question, and we are going to ask Matt, so Ted.", "Ted Grace", "Yes, just as it relates to the slide deck, the way we used to present it, it was actually measured a little differently it look at the sub accounts and so what we've done is actually aggregated on the sub accounts. So and actually now that the 10-K, I think the possibility of that nothing has changed except reporting it. I think as people want to interpret it before there was some confusion on whether just sort of what we in child accounts obviously more defuse in the parent accounts. Is that makes sense.", "Justin Jordan", "Yes, that\u2019s right. Thank you. And just on the rate pressure by key accounts versus other side?", "William Plummer", "It's more \u2013 you'll see variance by geography more than by account type. I think that\u2019s I have been pointing it to earlier. So when you look across the account type along the whole network, it's fairly similar by whether it's our national signed or we call territory accounts.", "Justin Jordan", "Got it. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thanks.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. We look forward to speaking you again when we ramp up the second quarter. In the meantime, feel free to reach us to Ted Grace, Head of IR to ask any questions or feedback and as always, as you pointed out our Investor deck has been posted out on the Internet. So thank you very much and we can end the call. See you next second quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

(NYSE:URI) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2017 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Michael Kneeland - Chief Executive Officer", "William Plummer - Chief Financial Officer", "Matthew Flannery - Chief Operating Officer", "Analysts", "Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Timothy Thein - Citigroup Investment Research", "Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets", "Jerry Revich - Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Nicholas Coppola - Thompson Research Group", "Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the United Rental's Second Quarter 2017 Investor Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the Company\u2019s press release, comments made on today\u2019s call, and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The Company\u2019s business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the Company\u2019s earnings release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as well as subsequent filings with the SEC.

Please refer to the back of the Company\u2019s earnings release and Investor Presentation, to see the reconciliation from each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.", "Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I would now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on today's call. We would like to cover today starting with a strong second quarter. Our results reflects some of the best fundamentals we\u2019ve seen in the years. Some of that external but a lot of it comes from executing well at the Company.", "I also want to talk about market demand, which has been stable at the high level. And we have some thoughts on how 2017 and 2018 will play out and then as the guidance that we gave an update last night.", "So let's start where we are today. Now I want to mention four metrics that are especially meaningful and then Bill will discuss them in detail for the quarter. Now, our metric is our volume, pro forma for NES volume in the second quarter was up 6.6% and we have a similar increase in the first quarter which points to a healthy marketplace.", "Rates another good story, we achieved positive rates trend across our business in the quarter with sequential improvements each month, and we're close to being positive on our rates year-over-year, but don't expect us to rest. rates will continue to be a major area of focus for us. Our employees understand how critical it is at this part of our strategy. Importantly, the gains around RATES, we also increased time utilization to a new record of 69.4%. This is the highest time utilization of any second quarter in our history. In fact, each month set a new record.", "And finally, our free cash flow. Through June stands at a robust $614 million, which is right on-track and that's after $968 million of growth CapEx spend. These are excellent metrics that show how effectively we are running the Company. Our people look at everyday managing the business with discipline right to the height of the NES integration.", "So one thing you will notice as we go through the call is that we're no longer talking about standalone NES in United Rentals. While the integration is ongoing, we are now operating at one organization. And we have made a great deal of progress on a $40 million of cost synergies we identified in April as Bill will discuss.", "So I'll give you some of the operational milestones. The back-office sale and operating teams are now fully integrated and the branches have moved onto our management systems. We're in the process of training our new employees on salesforce.com and our rate management tools. We're rolling out right optimization technology for deliveries and a special training is underway.", "We're also installing Telematics on the acquired fleet and we're about 10% through the retrofit program with Telematics installed on over 2500 machines. But one of the most important parts of the integration has nothing to do with equipment. Back when we bought NES we noted that our two companies share a strong sticky culture. While I'm pleased to say that last month. We had the safest June on record.", "We recently finished the series of [town homies] (Ph) for over 1000 employees in our combined Company. For some, this is the first Town Hall and their first chance to meet Company executives. And we opened these meeting to comments on safety, operational excellence, technology and communication and as always our employees are not shy about forcing their opinions.", "I was pleased to see so many different prospective put out there and we're always willing to change how we do things if there is a better way and the Town Halls help us schedule it. So NES has turned out to be a strong fit and we bought them at the right time.", "Now our performance this quarter was about more of an NES, our entire industry is in a growth cycle. Customers need more equipment and we\u2019re in front of them with a bigger fleet and a larger footprint. Key indicators such as the Dodge Momentum Index, the AVI and construction backlogs are all positive.", "Spending on commercial construction remains strong and to forecast of the U.S. equipment rental industry overall has continued growth over the next few years. Two former drags on demand have turned the corner, one is upstream oil and gas where the inflection point we saw last quarter has been sustained and the other is Canada.", "Western Canada seems to have stabilized and eastern provinces are going strong. Internationally rental revenue was up 7.3% in the quarter and volume was up 8.8% with improving rate trends. That\u2019s the strong as growth we seen in Canada and eight quarters.", "In the U.S. our largest revenue gains continue to come from two coast, in New England for example, more than $5 billion of large projects are either starting or ramping up in the third quarter following a strong spring. These range from Casinos and plant expansions to office complexes. In the West we're seeing multiyear project for entertainment venues and large corporate campuses. And in the South East, its automotive plants, data centers, infrastructure and manufacturing.", "Another fourth indicator is our customer confidence index, in June the level of optimism remains strong with a maturity of our customers indicating that they expect our business to improve over the next 12 months and we go right to the same conclusion. In our opinion the cycle has substantial runway ahead.", "Now turning to specialty, our Trench, Power and Pump segment continues to outperform underpinned by strong organic growth. In the second quarter, the segment revenue increased 19% year-over-year primarily on same store basis and gross margin improved by 250 basis points to 49.6%.", "Our Pump Solutions business had now standing showing with revenue up more than 37%, some of this is due to the rebinding upstream oil and gas, but they are also getting traction on other verticals. And we will continue to expand our specialty network with a total of at least 17 cold starts this year, seven of those are operating now, bringing our specialty footprint to 224 locations out of a total of 960.", "Our specialty cold starts tend to hit the ground running in part because many of our existing accounts needs solutions that are outside the scope of general construction. This helps to differentiate us a premium rental provider. Four years ago, in 2013 specialty accounted for 10% of our rental revenue in the second quarter. This year, the number was 19%, so specialty rentals are becoming increasingly important to our business.", "Another initiative is well tie in for the up cycle is Project XL. Project XL is a tool kit of work streams focus and driving improved profitability and we are targeting $200 million of run rate by year end 2018. All the pilots are complete and we are phasing them into the operations.", "And before I hand it over to the Bill, I want to spend a minute on guidance that we issued yesterday. It raises our 2017 outlook for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, capital spending and free cash flow. We are confidence that the market will support our higher expectations for revenue and EBITDA. And we've allocated another $100 million of CapEx to make sure that we can meet that demand.", "It helps to our industry continue to be more disciplined about repurchases and the supply of available rental equipment is being absorbed into the marketplace. And when we look at third-party data, we're encouraged by the broader industry is getting rates improvement as wellness growth and demand continues to outpace and supply, our rates dynamics are likely to benefit.", "I think my core comment this morning to convey not only the broad scope of the opportunity we had, but also how well positioned we are to take advantage of it. The decisions we make are designed to balance growth with margins, free cash flow and returns to maximize our long-term value. In the second quarter, we showed that we can achieve this balance across the business. Now as we entered the busiest period, we see even more potential to convert our strategy into value for our shareholders.", "So with that, I will ask Bill to cover the numbers and then we will go to Q&A. So over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Mike. And good morning to everyone. As Mike said, we got a lot of information this morning on the second quarter, a lot going on in the quarter. I'll try to give you normal color on the information that we usually report. We have also had lot of questions about NES and the impact there, so we will try and carve-out where we can information there that would give you sense of how NES is going for us.", "Let me start though as usual with rental revenue in the quarter $1,367 million was up and $163 million or 13.5% over last year. The components driving that were I will start with the ancillary revenue had a good quarter there with ancillaries adding $21 million over last year really driven by volume partly from NES, but just the raw volume of the more fleet on rent as well as the higher revenue from delivery and fuel associated with rentals.", "Re-rent was a positive too year-over-year, basically volume related there as well, but the bulk of that $163 million was the owned equipment revenue growth, within that $140 million from OER growth, $181 million contribution from volume, so really strong quarter in getting mostly on rent.", "RATES cost is about $13 million of decline year-over-year that from the 1.2% reported decline in rental rates versus last year. Our replacement CapEx inflation was $16 million in the quarter and then at left $12 million of unfavorability from mix and all other and there is a lot going on within the mix and other column this quarter, you will see that when we get through the bridge for EBITDA year-over-year, the addition of NES as well as other mixed factors like class and period mix.", "So those are all the key components to the revenue change year-over-year. Let me just take a minute to say a little bit more about our rates for the quarter and the impact of NES within that rates. It's a very difficult question to try and address how much the NES impact our rates for the quarter.", "Obviously the 1.2 as reported decline in rates reflects the fact that we didn't have any extra in the last year period, but we did in this year. And as you all know and you've heard us say before NES rates came in lower than United Rentals\u2019 rates and so it's had a drag affect on the reported 1.2 decline.", "You can see that by comparing that 1.2 decline to the pro forma rate performance which was a 40 basis points decline, with pro forma being defined as NES was put into the last year period as well as this year period. So that difference just gives you a sense of how much the addition of NES rates weigh down the as reported number.", "When we dig in and try and identify exactly what happened to the NES rates period-over-period, what happened to the legacy United Rentals rates period-over-period. It becomes very difficult to really carve things out that way. We\u2019ve integrated NES very rapidly, the fleet has moved tremendously, we\u2019ve consolidated branches and all of that just makes it really hard to say what is NES and what is United Rentals.", "But we still want to give you an indication, so what we did was we look at the regions in our business our U.S. gen rent business, where there was no NES impact. And we had three regions where there was either exactly zero or very close to zero impact from adding NES. Our pack west or Midwest and our south regions.", "For those three regions, when you look at their year-over-year rate performance, they were down three-tenth, very similar to the overall pro forma decline of the total company. So that gives us a sense that we were moving rates effectively in the right direction, both for areas that were impacted by NES and areas that were not.", "In fact if you look at the months of the quarter and look at the monthly sequential rates for those three regions combined. Those are pretty solid month, they had an April sequential of 20 basis points positive, 70 basis in May and 120 basis points in June. So nice improvements in rates even away from where we had impacts from NES. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more flavor for what the rate picture looks like both in the areas affected and the areas not affected.", "Let me move down to used equipment sales. $133 million of used proceeds in the quarter that was essentially flat with last year and delivered an adjusted gross margin of 52.6% which was up robustly 4.8 percentage points versus last year. Here again, there is an impact of NES, we just wanted to try and call out for you.", "Within the 133 of proceeds was included $15 million of proceeds from the sale of what had been NES equipment. That accounted for about $32 million of original cost equipment from NES sales. That NES sales impact we estimate at something like $6 million of benefit to the adjusted gross margin. So that will give you a sense of what happens when you are selling the NES fleet, which as I'm sure most of you know typically is older fleet, they operated with an older average age of the fleet, so it generated more robust margins than maybe we would have got out of our legacy United Rentals sales.", "They also had a more rapid depreciation schedule that also contributed to the book value being lower and therefore the contribution to adjusted profit from use being higher. All of the sales continue to happen in a robust market environment, our pricing experience is still pretty good within United Rentals and that compares to market pricing that our indication is still pretty good as well. In fact in the quarter, we sold equipment at a little over 89.5 months of age and we still realize 54% of the original cost for the sales this quarter. So pretty robust pricing environment for used equipment sales overall.", "Let me move to our adjusted EBITDA performance in the quarter $747 million in the quarter that\u2019s up $68 million compared to last year and the components of that $68 million increase were as follows. Volume, again the big story, $121 million positive over the last year, only offset by about roughly $13 million of rental rate decline that I called out in the revenue bridge. The ancillary gains contributed about $11 million at EBITDA and they were just about enough to offset the fleet inflation headwind that we normally experienced, that fleet inflation was about $12 million of headwind in the quarter.", "Used equipment sales year-over-year contributed $7 million, we did have our normal a merit increase that was a headwind of $6 million, we did also in the quarter have a bonus accrual increase as we adjusted our bonus programs to reflect the better performance of the Company year-to-date and what we expect for the full-year. That increase in bonus accrual cost us about $14 million compared to last year.", "Earlier in the year we said that - back in the first quarter we said that we thought that the bonus accrual adjustment this year would cost us about $27 million over the entire year, our view now is that it will be more like a $38 million impact for the entire year compared to last year and again that\u2019s reflecting the improved performance of the business overall.", "The last piece of the bridge to %68 million was mix another and that\u2019s a complicated story, this quarter given the addition of any of NES fleet and NES transactions to our results. NES revenue came in at a lower average dollar yield. NES revenue came in with all of the NES fixed cost and all of those things count against the mix and others. So mix and other was a decline year-over-year of $26 million versus last year which made up the last piece of that $68 million year-over-year change.", "Let me take a minute here to try and carve out the impact of NES at revenue and EBITDA just to give you a sense of how its playing through the quarter. Again, I\u2019ll emphasize that this is a very challenging thing to do because of the integration. But what we did here was to look at the individual assets that were brought in with NES acquisition and track those assets to get a sense of the revenue they generated during the quarter.", "So when you do that you get a rental revenue impact from those assets of about $87 million, so obviously you can debate all day whether it is just tracking the assets will give you the real revenue impact of adding NES, but we think that's the fairest way that we can think of to try and categorize what the revenue impact is.", "So $87 million of rental revenue impact and then beyond that we'll add to at the $15 million of used equipment revenue that I called out earlier and then we had $3 million or so of other revenue gains from the NES addition. So all together that's $105 million worth of revenue that came with NES acquisition or were the direct result of the acquisition.", "It gets harder to say what that means in adjusted EBITDA terms obviously because it get's difficult to allocate cost and to carve them out specifically to NES exclusive, right it's easy to do in an NES location, but when the fleet moves, how do you allocate cost?", "Still we took a turn at it just to have a framework for thinking about the EBITDA impact and we come up with the number that's about $46 million of adjusted EBITDA that we would attribute to NES. So $105 million for revenue and $46 million for EBITDA.", "If you look at the flow through in the quarter, our flow through for the total Company was 38.6% year-over-year and obviously if you use those any NES numbers for revenue and EBITDA you can back those out to get a sense of the flow through of the Company when you exclude the NES impact.", "That number calculates out to about 31% flow through in the quarter and I know some of you are thinking okay 31% that's not great for the business ex-NES what is going on. Well I remind everybody that that flow through is impacted by the rate performance of legacy business, it's impacted by the differences in used equipment sales this year compared to the last year, its impacted by the differences in the amount of other lines of business revenue and profitability this year versus last year and of course it's impacted by the $14 million of the incremental bonus approved that I talked about previously.", "If you take an estimate of all of those factors which we did and add the back as appropriate to the legacy URI business, you get to a flow through that looks lot like 50% that we've always talked about. So our feelings bottom line is that the business is performing well both for the legacy URI business and the NES\u2019 added business and we are going to continue to look for improvement still.", "Let me move really quickly to cash flow, free cash flow in the quarter was $614 million as Michael pointed out excuse me that's year-to-date, as Michael pointed out that's down from last year by $178 million, the big driver there was the increase in rental CapEx, our gross rental CapEx was $913 million year-to-date period and that alone was up $190 million.", "So that was the biggest driver, there were puts and takes in other areas obviously EBITDA improved, our interest expense improved, but our cash taxes went up as the you all remember that we burned up for NOLs during the course of the last year.", "That cash flow picture brought our net debt for the quarter - at the end of the quarter to $7.9 billion that was up from last year and it was up from where it was at the end of the last year and the primary driver of the increase obviously was the addition of NES, the purchase of NES offset by the free cash flow that we've generated so far year-to-date.", "Let me touch on Project XL real quickly. As Michael mentioned, we're making good progress there. We have the eight work streams well underway, some of which had pilots ongoing that now have been completed. And we feel good about what they are delivering in terms of the impact versus what we had in our targets.", "We took a turn at giving you a little bit more information about two of the work streams in our Investor deck. I'll point you all to that page and those work streams, one would to growth and infrastructure vertical and other is just continuing to drive our labor productivity. And certainly we can address in the Q&A if we have questions. But the big message is that we're on-track to deliver the $200 million impact from these initiatives that we talked about at our Investor Day that run rate by the end of 2018.", "I will remind you, I said this back in December, this is not $200 million of incremental EBITDA that you can just add on top of what you otherwise would model. Some of these initiatives are part of how we're going to continue to drive profit improvement in our Company and so you need to carve out which ones are add-ons and which ones are just part of the ongoing base business and as we get further into them we'll talk more about how you might frame that.", "The NES integration just real briefly there, it is going gone very well as Michael mentioned. We're on-track to deliver the $40 million of cost synergies by the end of 2018 that we called out at the deal. And based on the actions that we've actually taken so far this year, we would say that we've realized in the second quarter about $2.5 million worth of synergies from those actions. And the run-rate as we sit today is nicely on the path we delivering that $40 million by the end of this year.", "We should realize this year something between $15 million and $20 million of actual impact in 2017, and again that's including the $2.5 million that we've already realized in the second quarter. So well on our way on the cost synergies. By the way also on the procurement savings that we called out, we gave $5 million to $10 million range at the deal, and we believe we'll be at the higher end of that range when it's all set and going.", "Let me finish up real briefly with our guidance, you've all seen the numbers so I won't repeat the numbers. But just looking at the midpoint changes for a total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Total revenue went up to $175 million adjusted EBITDA of $78 million at the midpoints. The big driver of both of those increases were rate and volume out there. Obviously you see it in the numbers in the bridges for second quarter and year-to-date, our expectation is that those will continue to be a big drivers for the remainder of the year.", "There will be puts and takes of other ins and outs, but it's really going to be a story about rate and time. The $100 million of gross capital that Michael mentioned that we're adding, we added to both ends of the range, but you really should think about $1.6 billion as being our focused target for CapEx this year and obviously as we always have we will be very mindful to not spend that if we're not seeing the performance of the business shape up the way that we would like and neither we'll be afraid to come back and move it higher if we see the business performing better than our expectation right gearing that.", "And then finally on free cash flow, the $25 million increase just reflects some refinements of our estimates as we refine our views of cash taxes and working capital are probably the primary changes along with the operating profitability improvement that we pointed to. It\u2019s a lot, I know but we certainly wanted to give you as much as information as we could in a complex forward. It was a good quarter though and one that we're very pleased with and look to continue that momentum as we go into third and fourth quarter.", "So with that I'll stop my comments and ask the operator to open up the call for questions and answers. Operator.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Merrill Lynch. Your question please.", "Ross Gilardi", "Thanks good morning guys. This time last year you guys got a little bit of pricing for a couple of months and then it just sort of attracts seasonality for a while. What if anything is different this time and why?", "Matthew Flannery", "Hey Ross this is Matt, it\u2019s a fair question and one that we've asked ourselves to make sure that we maintain the momentum. I would say what is different is a couple of things. Number one and most important the demand environment and not just for us the work we're seeing in the industry, information that we're looking at looks like absorption continues to drive positive in the industry which is a good indicator.", "The other things is the record time utilization that we\u2019re experiencing and then thirdly we have growth this year and we didn\u2019t have this kind of growth and whether you want to use the stand alone or the pro forma number that that was not really the same story last year. So there is a lot of indicators as well as a strong end market macro environment that we feel should be very, very helpful to maintain momentum that we had versus last year.", "Michael Kneeland", "Ross, I would only add that last year we were going through really still adjusting to the fleet and balance and we're in a much better place in the industry today.", "Ross Gilardi", "Got it thanks guys and then just a follow-up, you guys have acquired NES and there seems to be a lot of midsize M&A happening, I mean does it feel like we're on the cost of a more substantial wave of consolidation in this space.", "Michael Kneeland", "Ross you know I've already said that the consolidation would continue to play out inside of our industry it's very fragmented. I think it speaks more to people have strategies as we do and they all do as well. The market cycle, I think it speak volume that their belief the market cycle is still there. And I also sit back and say from a strategy point and from an industry point of view, having increased professional management, I think will overall be a benefit to the industry collectively.", "Ross Gilardi", "Thanks Guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.", "David Raso", "Good morning. It's been probably 2.5 to three years since you had at the same time year-over-year growth and utilization rate and CapEx, it looks like we're about to - we are on the cuts of getting back to that. Given done that since like 2013, 2014 and you're doing 60% incremental EBITDA margin. So as much as I appreciate pull this out pull that out, you say we're kind doing that right now. But still it is what it is, incremental right now or 30% to 40%, 50% that want to pull out the bonus accrual, but still the power of having those three things going the same direction into 2018, can you try to handicap for us how we should think about incremental EBITDA margins and why they want to be materially stronger?", "William Plummer", "Sure Ross, I think materially stronger obviously would be the result of all of those things going together throughout 2018 as you said and rate will be an important driver there, how much of the a rate improvement could we see in 2018 as that would be the critical question about how the flow through might transfer out. Look I mean the analysis that we did, there a lot of assumptions to it, so I don\u2019t want to go too far with the specific about 50% statements that I made.", "But at the same time if we get rate to be mildly positive, if we continue to improve utilization, although that's big given the record nature of what we are doing now, but daily improve it just marginally and we are putting more growth capital into the business again that's an assumption not saying we are there yet.", "But all those things are lining up, 50% is I wouldn't say a given, but it's certainly the starting point of the discussion about where flow through could go next year. All of that of course need a market that will support all the assumptions that I just went through.", "David Raso", "Yes I\u2019m just trying to set up a base case, I mean to push back could be well back then you were getting a lot of rates in some utilizations that mix next year is probably hard to assume the same kind of rate growth that you had back then, but that said you also have some farther for cost improvement with NES and so forth. So not to ask you to give 2018 CapEx guidance right now, but can you help at least sort of frame how we should be thinking about growth CapEx or total CapEx however you want to describe it for 2018 just for base case.", "William Plummer", "Yes, David, it's still early for us to be thinking about that, we are talking about that, we are certainly thinking about it as we speak, but I would say that the momentum this year continues into late into the year, I think it's very reasonable to say that 1600 is the starting point for the discussion, all right and then we'll see where we go from there.", "David Raso", "One last quick one then Bill, in the month of June alone, we're talking pro forma on rental rates, were there any regions or how many regions, what percent of the regions actually already positive on rates year-over-year, for just the month of June pro forma?", "William Plummer", "For the month of June pro forma year-over-year, I can quote the sequential, but the year-over-year in the month of June, looks like it's five of regions that were positive and four of the ones that were not positive, another three or four were reasonably close to the breakeven.", "David Raso", "And remind us, you run the Company with how many regions exactly?", "William Plummer", "13", "Michael Kneeland", "13", "Matthew Flannery", "13", "David Raso", "13, so, basically five out of 13 up a few more kind of flattish and other ones are still the drag. Okay, I appreciate it. thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next question comes in the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup.", "Timothy Thein", "Great, thank you. Just to follow on that last point, can you quantify within the sort of what the two drags as you called out there, I guess not a region comments per say, but just energy and I guess you find that the braches that are in those heavy oil and gas regions and then I don\u2019t know if you can extend that to upstream. But if you kind a bucket energies as a broad kind of segment, and then just Canada as a whole. Just given the movement in the currency, I'm guessing, we shouldn't just use the difference between the 73 and 88 that you outlined. So maybe just help us in terms of those two drag that you called out. In terms of what they detracted from rates in the quarter?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure thanks and this is Matt. I'll answer the upstream conversation first. So as you can imagine, as we\u2019ve seen land rig count continue to decline, our upstream businesses climb. So we were up 68% year-over-year in Q2. That brings us to just under 5% of our total portfolio. So to answer your other questions if you want to look at our total energy exposure, we have about 5% of our business in upstream. About a little less than 2% midstream and about 7% in the downstream business.", "So that that nets to a little under 12, technically 11.5% of what you would call energy exposure. And we're very, very comfortable at that level and we're encouraged to see the upstream and we've seen a lot of pickup in our pump business specifically in that sector as well as other verticals within the pump business. As far as Canada, our Canadian business is kind of tailored to cities, but all of the provinces actually had some growth.", "We're little bit more challenged in Alberta, when you look at the country as a whole, our rental revenue was up 7.3% and that\u2019s almost 9% just under 9% volume, but still over 3% rate drag year-over-year on that business. But we feel really good about Eastern Canada and we feel that the other provinces in the Western Canada have bottomed out and some of the regions would follow a little bit. So we're encouraged by that.", "Timothy Thein", "Okay. And Matt, just can you remind us how quickly you would expect to re-price the NES book. And I'm guessing that a little shorter contract duration than maybe legacy URI. But can you just update us there in terms of the re-pricing opportunities with NES.", "Matthew Flannery", "Yes, we're not really looking at it as just re-pricing NES. We look at our pricing, it makes us a little bit unique as far as in customer buckets geographies and products. And so we're not really parsing out the NES, there are some key accounts with NES that we will treat probably a little more gradually just as we would our key accounts business at United Rentals.", "But overall, we're looking at these customers blended, we're emerging our rate zones, we're harmonizing our pricing and we're merging a customer accounts. So it won't be long before we only and really be able to identify that and NES and United Rates. We have a rate strategy as a Company that stays from the segments we talked about and we're going to deploy that across the board.", "Timothy Thein", "I appreciated it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research. Your question please.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Hi good morning. First question just on the specialty side, and I appreciate that we're right on the heels of NES. But as you see in the headlines a little bit step up activity on the M&A front. Just what you are seeing on the landscape there in the 2018 plans. You had talked about back in December and that included some inorganic growth in specialty. And so maybe just kind of where you're seeing that environment right now?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well first and foremost, we don't talk about the acquisition other than the fact that we do have a robust backlog things that we're looking at. With regards to specialty as a whole as you can see going from 2013 to Today in second quarter from 10% to 19% and the growth capital that we're putting in there along with the cold start. We have a very firm strategy of growing that business and we\u2019re going to continue to fund it.", "I think it differentiates us in a different way and our customer is obviously are very open to it. But we're always looking both for market opportunity, we're looking at potential acquisitions and we\u2019re also looking at different product mix that we could do within the specialty group. So it's all the above, but it's going to continue to grow.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Thanks. And then the in terms of just tone of the industry it looks like the survey results may be step down a little bit not sure if that\u2019s just tying run up and then come back down. But and may be just kind of adjustment what we're seeing in a reported survey results and then in general kind of what you are hearing from customers and some other confidence that\u2019s contributing to 2018 positively.", "William Plummer", "I would say we continue, whether it\u2019s the customer index, whether it's any of macro data we looked at or whether its intelligence we gain on absorption of fleet and rate improvement in the industry, everything is pointing to a strong environment for the balance of the year and we see that playing into 2018. that\u2019s the framework in which we\u2019re making our business decisions and we really haven\u2019t seen much to challenge that. There may be a pocket here and there by sector by vertical, but overall we\u2019re very encouraged with the demand outlook for the future.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, just to be clear, our customer index if you are referring to that it is strong, March was unusually strong and therefore it may look like it was dropping but fact that it is very strong.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Perfect. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Good morning. So my first question is just around the revenue outlook and I know you guys are refraining from providing explicit rate guidance, totally understand that but is there any way you can kind of frame the way the back half plays out according to the low end and high end of your guidance with respect to like normal rate seasonality like this is a normal seasonal outcome, is it better, is it worst.", "Michael Kneeland", "Nicole as you can imagine challenging when we don\u2019t want to be explicit about rate and time guidance. What I would say is that we\u2019re not making heroic assumptions about where rates goes in the back half of the year in that revenue guidance. Its well within the range of sequential that assume as well within what we've done historically and so we feel like we got a comfortable set of assumptions there, that\u2019s about as far as I think we should go.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay no doubt that\u2019s really helpful actually and then secondly just around the CapEx, the increase in the full-year guidance. And can you just talk a little bit about like equipment categories or you know priorities of spending for that new incremental bit of CapEx.", "Matthew Flannery", "Yes Nicole this is Matt. I would say that it's going to be fairly consistent with what our fleet profile is, we\u2019ll continue to put about 20% of that incremental capital into our specialty business and specialty will continue to grow a little bit faster than our Gen Ren, if you look at Q2 we think that will continue. When you look at the rest of the mix whether you\u2019re trying to model whether it will more aerial or more dirt or more of the other, it will be across the board very similar to our fleet profile as a company.", "Nicole DeBlase", "Okay. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.", "Seth Weber", "Good morning guys. Just going back to Tim's question first, is there any way to frame kind of what the starting point is here for the delta between URI's pricing and the NES pricing just so we understand kind of where you are starting yet and where NES prices could come up to? And also I would kind of tack on if there is an average length of NES contract.", "William Plummer", "Yes, Seth, it's challenging to think about of how to frame the impact beyond what we gave already, right. I think I recommended to somebody last night that if you sit down with a simple spread sheet and make some reasonable assumptions about what the share of business that NES contributes both this year and last year, you can frame out sort of in broad terms how to get to that four tens pro forma number and how that compares to the 1.2 as reported number.", "The actual assumptions that go into your spread sheet about sort of the relative rates of NES versus us, we\u2019ve characterize broadly in the past as being double digits the difference, so that\u2019s the starting point. Obviously with United Rentals being the premium and that gives you a sense of overtime how much of gap there is to bridge.", "How much that the gap we actually bridge and how quickly we actually bridge it, time will tell but that\u2019s the feel that you are playing on sort of double digits kind of number that we are working to make sense for our customer base as you go forward.", "Seth Weber", "Okay. That's helpful Bill, thanks. And then there has been a lot of discussion around the industry about mix, right and big industrial contracts and what not can you talk about the competitive rate environment specifically going after these larger, bigger and longer term industrial contracts what that looks like today?", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure Seth, this is Matt, I mean it's depending on what markets you are in and what customer you are going after and the volume, these are always competitive. The good news is they don\u2019t go out for bid regularly and we have been incumbent in many of these and that's gives us a lot of credibility. So we are comfortable with our positioning, it doesn\u2019t mean that we should never take any of it for granted, and this business will always have somebody wanting it and that's part of being leader in the industry.", "There is always someone that wants what you have that's something new for us, it\u2019s something that we very comfortable with and I wouldn\u2019t call it out any more or less competitive in whether this is a national account sector or whether you are fighting to get more share in an MSA. So we feel comfortable with the level of competitiveness, we're encouraged by the level of responsibility from an absorption and rate improvement that we see in the industry as well.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yes, the only thing I would add to that is the harness is on us to make sure a value proposition is such that we meet or exceed our customer expectations and that's why when you talk about our specialty, you talk about the capital that we\u2019re spending, you talk about the digital and things that we're doing for total control, finding ways to assist our customer to be more of a partner and finding ways to drive productivity and safety. That's what we need to do and that's what we need to keep focused on and we're very good at that and our team is really focused on it.", "Seth Weber", "Okay, all right. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.", "Jerry Revich", "Hi good morning everyone. I wondered if you folks can talked about how you are thinking about adding capital into the oil and gas impacted regions obviously big swings in the town and how is your risk appetite and capital deployment in those areas, can you just as we are clearly ramping up short-term here.", "William Plummer", "So Jerry, much of our growth has really come from absorption. As we had talked about in the past and probably the biggest example of it is our pump business. We made the decision a couple of years ago to hold on to some assets that we knew had a lot of life left in it. We mothball them, and we we're really getting the benefit of that decision today, when you see the type of growth that we're getting in that pump business. And those are types of decisions we made overall.", "We didn't expect to run 80% time use in the oil and gas markets. So when anymore accurate terms, so if we were willing to leave our footprint there, these feet enough to keep some capacity there, it gave us the opportunity to respond for this growth. And I think that's where we are today. We aren't having to dump a lot of fleet in there to drive that growth. And it feels good a little bit self congratulations here admittedly, but it feels good to have put in that faith and commitments and to be able to benefit from it.", "Michael Kneeland", "So that said, we learned lesson last time right and so we want to be mindful of how much of the business that oil and gas upstream activity represents and make sure that we're making a more balanced decision and more conscious decision this time around then last time it was just hey it's go, let's go. Nobody says that out loud but that was sort of the mindset. This time around we're saying okay, let's make sure that when we're putting fleet in it make sense both for right here now and what it means for this longer term.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay, thank you. And on that note I'm wondering if you could just frame the CapEx growth that you folks are laying out here over the balance of the year. Can you just give us a regional flavor which regions are getting an outside share of fleet growth. In other words where you folks seeing the strong growth?", "William Plummer", "It's very broad. I know we say that a lot, but that's because it's factual. When you look at it where maybe it's been a little more gated to the coast, but because they have been so hot. But it is very dry, its across the board. The folks in western Canada are probably getting the least of it for obvious reasons, because they has some fleet absorb. But everybody else is running real strong utilizations and really improvement throughout P&L and have earned that growth. And that's how we look at it. But you have to earn the growth and then we allocate it. the team has done good job very broadly.", "Jerry Revich", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Coppola from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.", "Nicholas Coppola", "Good morning. So I wanted to follow-up on the NES integration. Now you are three months in, it sounds like it's going well and you are on-track your synergy targets. Has there been any surprises to the positive or negative, any color you would add surrounding the integration?", "Michael Kneeland", "Well I would say the positive is we had tendency to link towards speed when it comes integration it's our firm belief that you move that way and you get the benefit of it, I would say this is even faster than we expected. And that's what makes it difficult while Bill had to go through so many assumptions to give you NES standalone information, we view that as a very positive story operating as one company.", "Another is the timing improvement, if you looked at the slide - you saw that the right panel of that slide, you saw that NES came in a little bit heavy on fleet a little bit lower time utilization. Part of our improvement is that we\u2019ve really ramped up that time utilization by absorbing that fleet quickly as a combined entity and it just go to approve that if you get everybody working together quickly, you can take advantage of all the capital that you have as a new combined team and that was probably even ahead of schedule of what we thought.", "Nicholas Coppola", "Yes, that\u2019s certainly a strong chart there and then I guess just another question, I wanted to ask about there is another slide about Project XL moving more to infrastructure and can you just may be add some detail around how you are moving forward with that goal or the new equipment types or mix shift that we should be expecting or is it really just more of a sales initiative of reaching out to new contractor types, may be just kind explain on that.", "Matthew Flannery", "Sure Nick, it really is a focus on that key customer segment that project type and making sure that we're well positioned to identify the opportunities and that we\u2019ve got the fleet to support those opportunities when we win them. So it's more of an adjusting new sales initiatives, but there is very much a focus that we're bringing to infrastructure projects now that we hadn\u2019t in the past.", "You can see in that XL slide, the impact when you it compare to sort of overall aggregate infrastructure spending in the economy, we're out performing. So that\u2019s the good news and we want to make sure that we continue to drive that focus because it\u2019s a vertical where we think we line up very well with those kind of projects, those kind of customers. And don\u2019t believe we were getting our fair share in the infrastructure space previously and we're driving hard to address that.", "Nicholas Coppola", "Okay. Perfect, thanks for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.", "Steven Fisher", "Thanks, good morning. As you guys step back and think about the market today, how would you characterize the supply demand balance within rental and where do you see that balance headed in the next few quarters as you think about the demand trends versus industry CapEx addition. I mean would you say that it is actually kind of tight today in some of these markets, where you are getting pricing or is it just more kind of your own initiatives or are we headed toward a position of kind of a tight market per say.", "Matthew Flannery", "Steve its Matt, there are certainly initiatives right and coming out of the first quarter just like we did last year it's your time to take advantages of what the market can give you as far as your focus on time and rate. So the demand has to be there, but with that being said, we feel that this is it's not just broad base for us, we expect the industry is doing a better job of being very rigorous on capital management and returns and I think that we're seeing that play through.", "And there is no sign that we would expect that to diminish and everybody that we talk to whether it's OEM, whether its customers, everybody is feeling better about the industry demand and the industry behavior. I think that\u2019s the most fair way to categorize that.", "Steven Fisher", "Okay I guess a related question just thinking about the strong time utilization, really just trying to gauge how much structural change you have made in driving efficiency and fleet utilization. I\u2019m just curious how many points of time utilization do you think you have maybe added over the last year that are results of better processes and less OEC not available for rent you know that time utilization that may be sticky overtime.", "William Plummer", "Yes, I think it's great point and its one of the reasons why we felt good about the NES acquisition because that density of fleet in the market gives you the opportunity to drive higher time utilization and we do think we are enjoying that and when you think about where that midst of our fleet has come and you look at our year-over-year time utilization, we continue to mix in assets specifically in specialty that run usually lower time, in some instance significantly lower time, yet we keep climbing.", "So, you have to look at it by category to truly break down the advantage, but we're pleased about the time utilization a trend that we've created on a year-over-year basis and how that comps to the industry. We feel strongly that's due to our density, allows us to do things that may be a regional or a local player can't do from time utilization prospect.", "Michael Kneeland", "But thanks for recognizing the fact that we are putting an effort and changing our processes, there is a chart on our investor deck on page eight that shows the NES during the time of acquisition where it is today, and speaks volumes about our team stepping up and making sure that we leverage our capabilities to drive better time.", "The question we have to ask ourselves is, is there more for us to pull and we do believe that as Mat mentioned earlier, our team has earned it and we want to continue to make sure that we meet that demand, but there is lot of things that we're working on and as you pointed out our processes and lean management is paying some dividend.", "Steven Fisher", "Would that be as much as maybe a couple of points of utilization?", "Michael Kneeland", "It's hard to quantify exactly, because there are so many things that we were doing inside the organization.", "Steven Fisher", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you and this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I would like to hand the program back to Mr. Michael Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well thanks operator and I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. As always, we're available to continue the dialogue, we'll have more insights for you in 90 days, so in the meantime please feel free to reach out to Ted Grace, our Head of IR anytime.

Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. I want to open the call by saying that we are extremely pleased with the strong third quarter results we reported yesterday. It was a pivotal quarter and one that require disciplined execution in light of many different dynamics at play, both internally and externally. Some of our strategic actions we took to grow the business, others were market conditions that were broadly positive for our industry where we could realize more value through scale. And then there were the hurricanes, which created immediate challenges and longer-term opportunities. Now our third quarter results and our new full year guidance were shaped by these dynamics.", "Well, I\u2019ll start by recapping some of the financial highlights. Now as a reminder, the year-over-year numbers are pro forma for the acquisition of NES in April, pro forma meaning the combination is presumed to be in effect for the third quarters of 2016 and 2017. Now one of the reasons we give pro forma numbers is to be as transparent as possible about how the business is performing, and in the third quarter our performance exceeded expectations.", "Now here are our four key metrics that reflect well in our execution in the quarter. One is our volume of equipment on rent; we delivered volume growth of 7.6% year-over-year. This was a solid step up versus the prior two quarters. Second is rates; a major one in the quarter. We generated positive rental rates both sequentially and year-over-year for every month in the quarter. This is the first period since the second quarter in 2015 that rates were positive year-over-year.", "If you recall last quarter I said that our rate trend looks encouraging, but we wouldn\u2019t rest. Well, we didn\u2019t rest, and I can promise you that we won\u2019t rest going forward. The industry backdrop on rates has become more constructive. And now that we\u2019ve turned the quarter, our team is excited to build on that.", "Third is time utilization. This metric has been running at record highs and we delivered again in the third quarter. Utilization increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 71.9%. That\u2019s probably a milestone for the quarter as a whole, but also for each of the months individually. And fourth, free cash flow. Through September was a solid $582 million which is ahead of expectations. That\u2019s after nearly $1.5 billion of growth rental CapEx and another $52 million of merger and restructuring costs.", "Before I move on I want to give you an update on our integrations. The heavy lifting behind us on NES we\u2019re tracking better than the $40 million of cost synergies we projected. With revenue synergies we remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve the $35 million target by year three. The Cummins rental acquisition is just two months old and it\u2019s already paying dividends. The assets and the team we brought onboard are fully integrated into our Power & HVAC businesses. And the Neff deal as you know closed earlier this month. So that\u2019s a fourth quarter impact.", "But here\u2019s an update on the integration. As of this week, the acquired branches are all running on our operating system. That\u2019s going to jumpstart our collaboration on sales and fleet. The rest of the integration is right on schedule. We\u2019re merging that back office sales, the operating teams, and adding telematics to the fleet. And we\u2019re analyzing the combined operations to identify efficiencies, as well as cross-sell opportunities with our combined customer base. None of these activities would ensure successful acquisition if we didn\u2019t have good people. And what we got with Neff is great people that come from a culture similar to our own. We knew that was true going in, and it\u2019s nice to see that first hand.", "Let\u2019s step up in scale. Neff gives us a larger platform for growth going into 2018 just as NES did in the spring. Both acquisitions are timed to capitalize on the continued strength of the cycle. In fact, the operating environment in the third quarter was among the best I\u2019ve seen in a while. Our core general rental business which excludes specialty, jumped 4.7% year-over-year pro forma.", "And from a company wide perspective, both the U.S. and Canada are trending well. Our business in Canada is up 9% in local currency. In the U.S. the coast remained strong and the Gulf and Southeast are starting to rebuild after the hurricanes. And our regions are broadly positive in their projections. In addition there\u2019s a lot of evidence pointing to sustained project activity, particularly in commercial construction. Our customer survey indicated that optimism has increased sequentially in the third quarter.", "Given the demand is so broad, I thought I\u2019d share some insights into our vertical activity. In the construction sector, our revenues from both non-residential and infrastructure increased by double digits year-over-year, and that would have likely been the case even without the NES contribution. Infrastructure is a target of our Project XL initiatives. So clearly that\u2019s paying off. And now residential construction is our core business because of the mix of commercial projects is so diverse, a double-digit increase in that space is exciting to see.", "In the industrial space with oil and gas we saw large year-over-year revenue increases across drilling, production and transmission. Refining was the only notable headwind and that\u2019s largely due to part of the storms. Elsewhere in industrial, the standouts in the quarter were the food and beverage, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. And by contrast, activity in the chemical processing industry was flat as expected. And overall I\u2019d say that we\u2019re in the strongest position yet to capitalize on the growth of industrial.", "I want to comment on specially operations. Our Trench, Power and Pump segment delivered a major increase in rental revenue in the quarter of 33%, primarily through organic growth. Break that out, Trench was up 16%, Power was up 44%, and Pump was up 46%. I\u2019m most impressed by what the teams did with the margin. Rental gross margin for that segment as a whole increased 280 basis points to an outstanding 54.8%. And we\u2019re on track to meet our target for 16 specialty cold-starts by year end, and in 2018 you\u2019ll see us continue to grow that segment as a cornerstone of our strategic plan.", "I also want to bring you up to date on the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria. We always hope for a quiet hurricane season. And while we don\u2019t always get our wish, this time the storms were particularly devastating. Our people are to be commended for how quickly they responded across our network. Harvey distorted hundreds of our employees and customers in Texas, some of them lost their homes and businesses. In Florida, the keys are still digging out and the West Coast has a long recovery. And it just wasn\u2019t limited to those two states; Louisiana took a hit, as did Georgia. In Puerto Rico where Maria was catastrophic, we\u2019ve been shipping fleets to our national accounts that are helping out with the recovery.", "Now our best estimate is the storm-related business accounted for about $6 million of incremental revenue in September, and I\u2019ll share something else about September. In the aftermath of historic hurricanes in the middle of the integrations and at a time that peak seasonality we had just three minor reportable incidence for the entire month and that\u2019s new safety record for us. Something else came out of Harvey that makes me proud. And I\u2019ve spoken about our united compassion fund before. Our employees donate to the fund to help their colleagues. After the Harvey hit the compassion fund\u2019s board which is made up of branch employees voted to make Neff employees eligible for emergency grants even though the deal had not yet closed. That tells you everything you need to know about our culture.", "So let\u2019s talk about CapEx. Our new guidance increases our CapEx plan to up to $200 million this year. And the broad growth of end market demand is starting to strain our fleet in some geographies. Our customers needed equipment for projects and we needed to be there for them. This is consistent with our strategy of protecting customer relationships that generate high returns over time, and we\u2019ll use a portion of the $200 million to address the natural disasters. And we expect this quarter to be a time of severe need for many of our customers. And so we\u2019re comfortable pulling some CapEx forward for that purpose. As always we can be very flexible adjusting the timing and the amount of our spend in a relatively short notice.", "So I\u2019ll close with this comment on the quarter. The most powerful tailwind behind our growth has been our disciplined execution across a combination of factors. Our Project XL initiatives, prudent investments in fleet, accretive acquisitions, and most of all a robust market demand. And we expect the same combination to bear fruit in the fourth quarter and our updated guidance reflects that. The fourth quarter is also where we\u2019re seeing new benefits from the Neff acquisition, a further injection of rental CapEx and the market activity that we think will exceed normal seasonality. So in short we\u2019ve added horsepower at a time when the cycle is trending in our favor. That gives us a great deal of confidence about where we go from here.", "So now Bill is going to review the numbers in detail, and then we\u2019ll go to Q&A. So, over to you, Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody. As Mike said, there\u2019s a lot going on in this quarter, so I\u2019ll get to the bridges pretty quickly and then we\u2019ll try to address some of the other items that are present in the quarter.", "Starting with rental revenue. As usual, let\u2019s go with the third quarter of 2017 totaled $1.536 billion, that\u2019s up $214 million over last year or 16.2% as you\u2019ve seen. We had a nice result in the quarter for ancillary and re-rent revenue, up $24 million on ancillary and $9 million on re-rent. And really that increase reflects the impact of NES along with the higher volume across our business overall. So ancillary is things like delivery, fuel our rental purchase protection program and so forth, nice increase there up about 18% over the prior year, and re-rent is re-rent of equipment that was up 19% as well.", "The OER increase totaled $181 million. Volume was a major driver there. Volume attributed $208 million of increase year-over-year, and then rate added another $1 million on top of that. And the deducts were replacement cost inflation calculated in our usual way, that cost is about $17 million in the quarter. And then mix and everything else was a headwind of about $11 million there as well. So those are the key pieces for the revenue change.", "The only other highlights for revenue include the impact of the storms. Michael mentioned that we recognized about $6 million of revenue incrementally for storm affected areas in the quarter, that\u2019s in the year-over-year change. Looking ahead that $6 million should grow to something like $20 million of storm-related revenue impact in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to used equipment sales. $139 million of proceeds in the quarter, that\u2019s on a sale of $238 million of OEC equipment in the quarter. So $139 million represents a $27 million or 24% increase year-over-year in proceeds from used equipment sales, and that included about $26 million of proceeds for a former NES equipment that were sold in the quarter. I called that out because as in the second quarter those units brought along a higher margin based on the greater depreciation attached to the NES equipment. So that impact is coursing through the overall result in the quarter.", "It shows in the margin. Our margin in the quarter for used equipment sales in adjusted basis was 56.8% and that\u2019s up 10.4% \u2013 percentage points over last year. So the NES impact is certainly part of that year-over-year increase, but not all of it. We are selling used equipment into a pretty strong market overall, I think that\u2019s supported by a number of external measures. But it\u2019s also very directly supported by our results year-over-year in our retail sales.", "On a like-for-like unit basis compared to last year we were selling equipment in our resale channel, it\u2019s something around 5% higher prices than we did last year in the third quarter. So robust market overall, supported by the sale of older and more depreciated NES units, explains that 56.8% margin for the quarter. Whatever way you want to look at it though, it\u2019s a pretty good result for us. The average age of the units that we sold were about 93 months, and yet we still brought back over 50% \u2013 53.2% in fact of the original value of the fleet in our used equipment sales, so a pretty strong result down the line.", "Moving to adjusted EBITDA. $879 million is an increase of $132 million over last year or 18% increase, and the margin in the quarter was 49.8%, that\u2019s 30 basis points better than last year. Similar story here, volume is the main driver, a positive $139 million impact from the 18% increase in volume, and rental rates contributed only another $1 million or so positive there. The strong ancillary result, we calculated $14 million of positive year-over-year contribution, and then our used sale result as I called out before the margin was up about $27 million year-over-year. Other lines of business contributed another $4 million outside of used rental and the ancillary that I called out previously.", "The deduct fleet inflation we calculate is $12 million of headwind, our merit, our usual $6 million in the quarter. The biggest deduct was the increased bonus accrual that we had in the quarter. Compared to last year our bonus accrual program was up $28 million, that\u2019s an increase reflecting the strong performance this year, but it also compares to a slightly lower than normal number last year as we \u2013 many of you might recall we adjusted our bonus program accrual downward in the third quarter of last year to reflect its performance. So that\u2019s the biggest headwind, that leaves about $6 million, $7 million of mix and other negative year-over-year to explain the $132 million overall impact.", "Just to call out the impact of the storm-related revenue on EBITDA, that $6 million of incremental revenue from the storm areas translated into about $4 million of EBITDA benefit spread throughout these various lines in the third quarter. And as we look to the fourth quarter, the $20 million of incremental revenue in the storm areas that I called out, we expect to translate into something like $12 million of EBITDA benefit in Q4.", "Flow through from this EBITDA was 51.2% in the quarter, but that does include that merit \u2013 that bonus accrual increase that I called out. If you adjust for that $28 million, our flow through in the quarter would be 62% for the quarter, which is in line with the 60% that we typically \u2013 Mike talked about.", "Moving to free cash flow. Mike called out the $582 million of free cash flow, once you adjust for $52 million of merger and restructuring related cash outflows, that number moves up to $634 million year-to-date through September. And I put out that number because that\u2019s the basis on which our guidance is given for the full year, excluding the merger-related and the structuring charges. So it\u2019s a pretty strong free cash flow result so far this year. It is down from last year at the same time last year was a particularly strong free cash flow year for us.", "If you\u2019re interested in the year-over-year bridge, the main driver is obviously $200 million year-to-date of increased adjusted EBITDA is a good guide, but against that our rental CapEx is $340 million higher than it was last year, so that\u2019s a deduct. Our cash taxes are higher by about $100 million so far this year, that\u2019s a deduct. And then the net of interest paid merger and restructuring charges and all other working capital adjustments gets you to the $264 million delta between this year and last year.", "Our rental CapEx expenditure for the year totals $1.5 billion so far year-to-date, and again that\u2019s up about $340 million versus last year, and reflects the higher plan spend but also adjust the overall strength in the market that we\u2019ve been addressing with our rental spend and maybe some timing differences this year versus last year. That net rental CapEx year-to-date is $1.1 billion, and again it\u2019s up about $325 million or so versus last year.", "In the debt activity and liquidity it was a very busy quarter for us in our debt transactions. In addition to financing the Neff acquisition, we also refinanced our 6 1/8 note. We upsized our accounts receivable facility by about $50 million, we have upsized our ABL by about $500 million, and we call the remaining balance of the 7 5/8 notes that were still around all during the quarter.", "The 7 5/8 redemption will actually fund later this month in October, so it didn\u2019t show in the year end balance of debt, but the activity was very robust in the quarter. It left us with a net balance at the end of the quarter of net debt balance of $8 billion, up a little bit from last year. And again, I\u2019ll remind you that does not include the settlement for the Neff purchase. That settled on the second. And so when you add that funding net debt on top, our net debt balance right now is something about $9.4 billion.", "We also improved our liquidity during the quarter. It shows at the end of the quarter it\u2019s $2.9 billion, but that did not take into account the payment for Neff. So if you make that adjustment, we finished the quarter with about $1.6 billion of total liquidity, including ABL availability and our cash balance.", "Let me touch on share repurchase just briefly. You saw in the announcement that we announced the reauthorization of repurchases under the existing $1 billion repurchase program that we have, and that program has about $370 million remaining to be executed. The reauthorization is basically housekeeping. When we initially announced the $1 billion repurchase, we put a time limit of about 18 months on it. While we have the program paused as we settled in on the NES acquisition and got ready for the Neff acquisition, that 18-month time period expired, and so this was just a reauthorization of the same program.", "Our intent is to evaluate our cash flow position for the remainder of this year after the Neff settlement and as we build our confidence that cash flow is on the path that we expect. We would expect to begin executing under that program with the intention of completing it by the end of 2018.", "Real quickly on Project XL. We have continued to make good progress on the Project XL initiatives toward the $200 million run rate impact that we called out by the end of next year. A variety of the projects are all moving along nicely. We did put in the investor material a look at one of the other initiatives under Project XL, which is our focus on improving our realization of used equipment pricing. We look to improve it relative to fair market value of the units that we sell.", "So we gave you a schedule that just shows you how we progressed on that year-over-year improvement measure throughout the course of this year and the cumulative EBITDA impact that we realized during the course of this year because of that improvement. I think it shows up in the commentary that I made about our used equipment results in the quarter earlier, and it is just one more view of the kind of thing that we are doing under Project XL.", "Real quickly on the integration of NES. Just to give you a synergy update, as Michael mentioned, the integration is essentially complete at this point with the major actions having been taken already. And our run rate now for the realized synergies is nicely higher than the $40 million that we initially called out. For the sake of discussion, we could call it about a $40 million run rate. In fact, in the quarter, we realized about $10 million -- $45 million run rate, I would say, about a $45 million run rate.", "In the quarter, we\u2019ve realized just a little over $10 million in Q3, and that puts us on a path to realize something north of $20 million, call it $23 million to $25 million in the full year of 2017. So nice progress there for the expense saves, synergies. And then regarding the fleet procurement savings, we called out a range of $5 million to $10 million, and we believe that we\u2019ll be delivering at the higher end of that range once it\u2019s all said and done.", "Let me wrap up with some commentary on the guidance update that we gave. You all have seen the numbers, but just to add a little bit more color, the increase in our EBITDA and revenue guidance really reflects a couple of major drivers. Obviously, the impact of adding Neff in Q4 is included there, but it also reflects just the overall strength of the business that we saw build during the third quarter.", "So I\u2019ve called that already. The impacts of revenue and EBITDA from Neff additions. So just to be -- I haven\u2019t done Neff. I did the storm-related. But just to give you some more insight on what Neff is included in that guidance update, we expect the revenues from Neff in the fourth quarter to be about $110 million, and we expect EBITDA to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $55 million from Neff alone.", "On CapEx, Mike hit the real motivation behind our CapEx increase. Certainly, it\u2019s partially due to the demands from the hurricane-affected areas, although not from replacing fleet that was damaged. That amount was fairly minimal for us. If you look at both the Harvey and the Irma areas, in total, we lost about $13 million of OEC fleet due to the storms. So clearly, we\u2019ll have to replace those, but it\u2019s not a major part of the increase in CapEx that we guided. Really, that increase was importantly guided by the overall demand that has spiked in those hurricane-affected areas.", "We\u2019ve moved about $100 million of fleet into the hurricane-impacted areas. And so we will up our spend a little bit to cover the fleet that came out of other areas into hurricane-affected and to put some more fleet back into those areas that donated into the hurricane areas. And then we\u2019re going to add a little bit more fleet that will land in the hurricane-impacted areas to help with what we expect to be a nice incremental demand from the rebuild activity as that plays out.", "Maria, just to mention that, we haven\u2019t done a lot with Maria. We\u2019ve certainly shift some equipment to customers who are taking it over to Puerto Rico. We expect that there\u2019ll probably be a little bit more demand that plays out there as we go forward, but haven\u2019t really put a strong number to that just yet.", "Michael mentioned that some of the increase in CapEx we\u2019re thinking about as a pull forward for next year, and that\u2019s certainly the case. That is the way that we\u2019re managing the uncertainty around how long the rebuild incremental demand will play out. If we see it play out for a longer period of time, then we can increase our spend next year to replace what was pulled forward into this year. But if it dies down more quickly than we expect, then we can adjust by thinking about the spend this year as pull forward for next year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color in how we\u2019re thinking about CapEx. But certainly, we can address it further in Q&A if a question is still out there.", "Finally, on free cash flow, we increased our guidance at the midpoint, something like $75 million. And certainly, that reflects the increase in CapEx net of incremental EBITDA and any working capital impacts and just the other components of our free cash flow.", "Importantly, our cash tax expectation in the quarter and in the year is lower as a result of the extra CapEx and the bonus depreciation attached to that, but also of the Neff addition, right? You all remember when we announced Neff that it brought along a nice tax -- cash tax benefit with the step-up in depreciation and small -- a balance of NOLs that Neff added. So as that plays out in the fourth quarter, it benefited our cash taxes and certainly was a part of that increase in our guidance for the full year.", "That\u2019s a lot, but we certainly wanted to give you a little bit more detail on a variety of these areas to help give a sense of the impacts in the third quarter and what we think in fourth quarter. But certainly, we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions about anything I may have missed in the Q&A. So let\u2019s go to the Q&A right now. Operator, let\u2019s open up the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your question please.", "David Raso", "Thanks very much. I was just trying to think through what you just reported and what you guided, how does it sort of influence how I think about your earnings power next year? And what caught my eye was the implied fourth quarter. You have an incremental EBITDA margin implied around 47%, which is actually a little lower than the 51% you just did. And I\u2019m just thinking about the incentive comp drag, I would think would be a little lower than we just went through.", "Neff stand-alone comes in at higher EBITDA margins than 47%. And maybe most importantly, if we\u2019re thinking about 2018, it seems like the fourth quarter maybe the first time in, I don\u2019t know, two years, three years where your rate growth year-over-year could be as much or more than your fleet utilization growth, which historically is a positive mix for profitability. So can you help us understand why the incremental EBITDA margins will be worse in the fourth quarter than the third quarter?", "William Plummer", "Thank you, David. I\u2019ll start on that one. Regarding our bonus accrual, you\u2019re right. It shouldn\u2019t be as high as what it was in the third quarter. But I do remind you that we gave ranges. And the ranges, I would argue, if you look at the extreme of the ranges, it might be a little bit more normal in terms of the incrementals in Q4.", "David Raso", "Okay. So thinking after then to the 2018 thought process, the way you thought about CapEx and given what appears you\u2019re going to have some carryover from rate utilization, obviously, is also going to be healthy with -- especially in the hurricane areas in the fourth quarter. When you set up the framework for 2018 and it\u2019s framework, it\u2019s early, is next year a year where the framework is rate growth should be higher than your utilization growth? Just given how hot the utilization is and how we\u2019re exiting the year, I would think that would be base case. But just so I understand so again I think about the potential implications on incremental margins.", "William Plummer", "Sure. So I don\u2019t make a link between rate growth and utilization growth the way your question implies. What I would say separately is that our utilization growth has been pretty strong over the course of this year and actually going back into last year. And it\u2019s, in my view, not reasonable to expect that we\u2019re going to continue to deliver 160, 180 basis point improvement year-over-year forever and ever. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that year-over-year comparison come down a little bit in 2018. And so that\u2019s the way I would think about that.", "Rate growth, we\u2019ve established momentum in the right direction, right? The question is how far can that go? And that\u2019s really going to be handed to us by the market as well as our execution. I feel confident that our execution and focus on rate is going to be good. Will the market continue to offer up the kind of year-over-year improvements that we started to see here? Time will tell. So those two components I think about separately. But I think in any case, both of them are set up nicely going into 2018. And we\u2019ll execute as best we can in 2018 to take advantage of what\u2019s there.", "David Raso", "And with this, just sort of clear, though, you\u2019re thinking separately, but fundamentally, rate provides a better incremental margin than utilization, correct?", "William Plummer", "Absolutely. We certainly want to get as much rate as we can and do it within the operational framework that allows us to deliver time utilization improvement, right? That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. The question is, is the market environment there that allows us to do it? If it is, I think we can deliver pretty effectively as you saw in Q3.", "David Raso", "All right. I appreciate the time. Thank you.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup. Your question please.", "Tim Thein", "Great, thank you. And Bill, just to follow up on rates, can you update us in terms of where you are today in terms of repricing the NES contracts? It would -- at least, based on the pro forma you gave last night, it would appear that you did make further progress in terms of narrowing that spread. But just kind of want to get an update there as to where we sit today on harmonizing those contracts. And then just as related to that, where, based on the midpoint of your revenue guidance for 2017, what would the carryover impact be at the midpoint in 2018 on rates?", "Matt Flannery", "So Tim, this is Matt. I would say as far as NES contract harmonization, they didn\u2019t have a lot of fixed price business in NES. So that would be an area where you would actually technically go to the customer and harmonize any gap that would exist between the two.", "We don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not really tracking, at this point, any NES stand-alone metrics. The business is so fully integrated right now, as Mike had mentioned in his opening, that the customers are seeing it all as one. And most of the pricing is spot pricing at this point. I will say that wherever there are gaps, they\u2019re all in one price zone right now. So you continue to see movement towards -- much closer towards United historical pricing. But we\u2019re also very cautious that these are relationships that we value and we paid a lot of money for, and we\u2019re going to maintain those relationships. So it\u2019s not directly answer your question, but I think directionally, you\u2019ll see in the rate results that we\u2019ve done a good job of creating a lesser gap.", "William Plummer", "Yes. And Tim, on carryover, I mean, you guys can all fill out a spreadsheet as well as we can and make your own assumptions about how the rest of this year finishes out. But if you make any reasonable assumptions, I think you\u2019re going to be a point of carryover, if not a little higher going into next year if this year finishes out with anything decent. So the backdrop is a good starting point, but that\u2019s not where we want to rest on our laurels, right? We want continue to try and manage the rate and do it in the context to what the markets offer.", "Tim Thein", "Okay thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your question please.", "Rob Wertheimer", "Thank you operator and good morning everybody. So you are effectively achieving record time utilization. And you guys have worked hard and getting rate also, which is lovely. You guys have worked hard on operational improvement. Can you see at a branch-by-branch or region-by-region level whether you can actually push time utilization higher than you might have thought two and three and four years ago, and therefore, you can get more out of less fleet? Or do you think you\u2019re actually at pretty good levels here and if the market\u2019s strong, you\u2019ll continue to add fleet to keep it at this level?", "William Plummer", "Yes, Rod. So we\u2019re certainly are at pretty good levels and considering we\u2019re at record levels. So we already enjoyed significant time use advantages over the industry benchmarks. I think that we ask our questions all the time is how high can we go? Density helps us with that, and I think that some of what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019ve grown to be a bigger company. Density and marketplace certainly gives us the opportunity to drive higher time than you could have in the past.", "It\u2019d be difficult for me to say that we\u2019re going to beat the record year next year, but I guarantee you, that is our goal is to continue to push time use as high as possible.", "Matt Flannery", "Look at September, right, 73.6% utilization in the month of September. Imagining operating at that kind of level all year long, it\u2019s certainly something that would be great to see. But it\u2019s a real challenge, right? It\u2019s tiring to operate at that level. As we continue today, our lean initiatives and our focus on improving our operations are all about getting us more a capability of operating at higher levels of utilization. I think it\u2019s fair to say a few years ago the thought of being at 73.6% in September might have been intimidating to some people.", "Well, we just did it, and so there\u2019s opportunity to do better. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do on a continual basis.", "Rob Wertheimer", "That is wonderful. Can I ask you a little bit of a more, same idea but a little bit more of a structural one? Can you see yet results from Total Control that go beyond anecdotal and served indicator or not that you can widen your competitive gap versus the industry and how you\u2019re able to provide better efficiency to your customers\u2019 utilization or otherwise? I mean, just maybe see if that is widening out on the data versus industry results.", "Matt Flannery", "Yeah absolutely Rob. Our penetration with our TC customers continues to grow. It\u2019s a big differentiator for those customers that value that tool. And we will continue to separate further by enhancements to those tools. Technologies moving quickly, and we have to keep up with it. If you think about just GPS alone, we have over 200,000 with GPS, telematics on it right now, and our goal is now 270,000 with the addition of the extra Neff and NES fleets. So we continue to fill out that value prop to our customers on technology, telematics, and TC is a big part of that.", "Rob Wertheimer", "Thanks, I will turn it over. Appreciated.", "William Plummer", "Thanks.", "Matt Flannery", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Your question please.", "William Plummer", "Hey Scott.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Good morning everyone. Two quick questions. I\u2019ll ask them both upfront. One, on the CapEx pull-forward, I understand that the storms in strong demand environment. Could you discuss is there any pricing benefit to that with OEMs since we\u2019re in that season and how we might think about that as a pricing perspective next year?", "And then the second question is with the mention of the resumption of the share repurchase program, are we taking a step back here from the M&A pipeline? Just curious the implications of that. And if not, kind of areas you\u2019re looking at.", "Michael Kneeland", "Yeah Scott, I will take the second. I\u2019ll start with the second. And then, of course, Matt and Bill can jump in on the first one. But no, I think Bill outlined it, as we talked about a little bit of housekeeping. But we look at every acquisition on its own merits. The team has done a wonderful job of providing lots of dry powder for the company, and we\u2019re very disciplined about our approach. That will not change. I\u2019ve talked about it ad nauseam about how we think about strategic fit financial and cultural. And we will continue to look and see what those opportunities bring. We\u2019re not afraid to do an acquisition, and we\u2019re not afraid to pass on them either.", "So I think the disciplined approach that we\u2019ve had has yielded great benefits. And you\u2019re seeing that in some of our results. As far as the first question, I\u2019ll pass it over to Matt.", "Matt Flannery", "Sure, so we most of the fleet that we buy are from strategic partners that we set up on an annual basis. And we don\u2019t leverage them in a last-minute order, and they don\u2019t leverage us when things are tight. So there\u2019s really no movement there in pricing. These are more important longer-term relationships that we have with our vendors, and we\u2019re very pleased with the way we\u2019re treated.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Thanks very much guys.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Box from KeyBanc. Your question please.", "Joe Box", "Hey good morning guys. So maybe just to dovetail off of Scott\u2019s question. I mean, it seems like utilization is pretty tight across the entire space right now. Curious to your sense for maybe the industry\u2019s appetite to grow fleet. And then related to that, is there any risk right now that the OEMs actually can\u2019t deliver on your $200 million CapEx increase?", "Matt Flannery", "So Joe, we \u2013 no, we have POs aligned, slots aligned we got everything we need to execute on that. If the demand remains, we\u2019ll go all the way up to that $200 million. If not, it\u2019ll be towards the 70 50. But we\u2019re all dialed in with as far as slots and deliverables from the OEMs.", "Michael Kneeland", "The market dynamic will be the market dynamic. We don\u2019t know what the competition will do or not. We are myopically focused on our customers and the value proposition that we can bring, but we\u2019re cognizant of it. We watch it. And again, we are very disciplined around our capital spend.", "Joe Box", "So maybe just a follow-up. I\u2019m just trying to understand some of the moving pieces for CapEx and free cash flow for next year. Certainly, not asking for guidance, but directionally, how should we be thinking about total replacement need here? Obviously you guys have added Neff, which probably need some replacement. And then are we thinking more or less replacement needed as we started to climb out of maybe the lack of purchases from 2009 to 2011.", "William Plummer", "Yes. So Joe, regards replacement, if you think about it as the legacy United business needing to replace, we\u2019ve been selling something like $1 billion of OEC before the NES deal. So that continued with a little bit of growth, plus you add a need for replacing, let\u2019s say, 100 each for NES and Neff, just to use round numbers, that gets you up to $1.2 billion kind of replacement spend on an OEC basis. And obviously, the inflation impact there, you have to add in, right? Because you\u2019ve got every unit that you buy today replaces a 7, 8-year-old unit at 15% lower price.", "So you add 15% on top of that, you\u2019re probably in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion kind of replacement need out of your CapEx next year. So that\u2019s a rough starting point. And then we\u2019ll debate, of course, growth on top of that, and that will get us to a 2018 CapEx number. We\u2019re going through that process right now, our budgeting process. So clearly, we haven\u2019t decided on the final number. But in terms of replacement spend, that\u2019s the logic that\u2019s pretty good starting point.", "Joe Box", "That\u2019s helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your question please.", "Ross Gilardi", "Hey good morning guys. I wanted to ask you guys just a couple of macro questions. Just first on interest rates in general. I mean, we\u2019ve obviously been in this low interest rate environment seemingly forever now. What happens to the business in the rental industry if we get a spike in interest rates? How should we think about your position versus some of the smaller players and so forth and just the overall growth dynamics?", "William Plummer", "So we\u2019ve always said it depends on what caused the spike in interest rates, right? I mean, obviously, the cost of interest goes up, but if the spike is driven by incremental economic activities across the economy, then in construction, you would expect the benefit from that. And so the net-net impact might be positive associated with a spike in interest expense. As it relates to sort of the competitive position of us versus the rest of the rental industry, well, I certainly feel great about the position that we\u2019re in, right? We\u2019ve got a very low level of floating interest in our overall debt structure. And so we would feel an impact, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say it might be less of an impact than some of our competitors. And so that should put us in a little bit more advantage position in terms of financial performance.", "Could it stress some of our competitors to the point of them impacting the actions they take in the marketplace? I guess, it could, but it depends on the individual competitor that you\u2019re talking about.", "Ross Gilardi", "Okay, thanks Will it is helpful. And then do you think the repricing on NES and I imagine you\u2019re going to go through some of that with Neff as well, do you think the repricing of the contracts because they\u2019re pretty big players in the grand scheme of things after you and Sunbelt, I mean, is that contributing to the general pricing environment that we\u2019re seeing in the market?", "Matt Flannery", "Ross, this is Matt. There are some contribution to it, right, from NES. Neff, we\u2019re pretty aligned across the board about our pricing, our pricing methodology and the culture around pricing. But with NES, we got a little bit of lift from that. I think more importantly even in our non-NES overlap markets. We have seen similar pricing increases. So although it\u2019s not a driver for the macro, it is certainly a couple of bps improvement over the normal.", "Ross Gilardi", "Thanks guys.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Vertical Research Partners. Your question please.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Hi good morning. First just thinking about some of the EBITDA lifts next year related to Neff and NES. Could you talk about what\u2019s remaining on the stub portion there just with some of the seasonality that we could see in 4Q or 1Q and stuff that wasn\u2019t captured with them. What your thinking as we roll into 2018 on that? And then any additional contribution on some of the realized synergy savings.", "William Plummer", "Joe, it\u2019s Bill. I\u2019m going to have to ask you the question again. I\u2019m missing your question.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Sorry. So really just looking at the tailwinds to EBITDA from Neff and NES, as you get full realization of those next year and then on top of that, you get some cost synergies?", "William Plummer", "So I think if your question is about sort of the full year effect next year of adding NES and Neff, we\u2019ll have an extra quarter of NES next year. This year, that number was about $30 million. So that could be a good starting point. So call it $30 million of impact from adding a quarter of NES. For Neff, call it $150 million for adding the three quarters that we didn\u2019t own it next year. And then the synergies for NES, I called out north of $20 million of synergies realized this year. If you had a 45 run rate, you call it 25 realized this year, that nets out to an incremental 20 year-over-year. So that\u2019s a benefit next year.", "For Neff synergies, let\u2019s \u2013 you can pick your own number, right? We said 35 of synergies fully realized at the end of two years, I think, it was. So $25 million, $30 million of synergies realized during the course of next year. You pick [Audio Dip] that\u2019s an impact there that we might see. Is that helpful?", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. And then just in the press release, it noted fourth quarter market activity would exceed normal seasonality. And just any additional context on that. In particular, how do we think about if there is such a thing as normal seasonality for rates and based on EBITDA margin that\u2019s implied, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re suggesting better-than-normal rate experience?", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, Joe. This is Matt. I think that was more referring to demand and partially an explanation of why you saw an increase in the capital spend ranges. We normally wouldn\u2019t spend that much in a Q4, so we thought it noted an explanation. But that demand is there, and it\u2019s not all just storm-related. As far as rate, I mean, we\u2019re going to always push to do more, but we all understand the seasonal patterns of rate, and all of this is embedded in the guidance that we just updated.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "And can you add anything just on the months? I mean, normally, sequentially, I think we\u2019d still see growth in October, maybe a little bit November, December, sometimes under a little bit of pressure. Anything that you could do in terms of adding numbers to that?", "William Plummer", "Yes. Normally, the normal \u2013 what\u2019s normal but if you go back over an overview as you would see a positive October. November can go either way, depending on the year that you\u2019re in, and December typically would be a slight negative. But how much on each of those is always the challenge, right? So I\u2019ll leave that to your imagination.", "Joe O\u2019Dea", "Perfect. Thanks a lot.", "Matt Flannery", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.", "William Plummer", "Hi, Seth?", "Seth Weber", "Hey, good morning guys. Hi good morning.", "Matt Flannery", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth Weber", "So just going back to the CapEx pull-forward question. Is it safe to assume that most of that is tilted towards Gen Rent versus specialty? And I guess, the spirit of my question is if you look at dollar utilization for the quarter, it was actually down for booms and lifts and forklifts as well year-over-year. So I mean, earthmoving was up. So can you give us any flavor for where that incremental CapEx was going and maybe any color on why dollar", "Matt Flannery", "Sure, Seth. Well, first, I think you\u2019ll have to remember, if you\u2019re looking on a year-over-year basis, we did \u2013 you\u2019re looking at a comp that didn\u2019t have the NES boom business in it and then does in Q3 this year. So that was a little bit of drag on the age that we\u2019ve been moving down and a little bit of a drag on the dollar but which will continue to improve that spread as well.", "As far as the pull-forward spend, it looks very much like what our normal spend would be, maybe a little more heavily weighted on specialty. Because some of the immediate response that we needed and a little less on booms and reach forks for the same exact reason we have more of those around. So other than that, it looks similar to our profile. Almost all of it core fleet and very fungible assets.", "Seth Weber", "Okay. So more on specialty, Matt, is that what you said?", "Matt Flannery", "Yes, a little bit more on specialty just because some of the remediation, some of the power. And we might even got some more pumps, as busy as pump was to help.", "Seth Weber", "Okay. That\u2019s great. And then maybe, Bill, just a quick follow-up on Project XL. Appreciate the disclosure of the 10 \u2013 I think it was $10 million or $11 million from that one initiative on the used sales. But can you just give us an update kind of where you\u2019re at? And we\u2019re getting close to needing to have some sort of line of sight to that $200 million number. Can you help us frame out the steps to get \u2013 how should we think about the cadence to get to that $200 million run rate number versus where we\u2019re at today?", "William Plummer", "Sure, Seth. So we\u2019ve discussed this every quarter since we\u2019ve talked about Project XL. And we debated about the best way to tell the story in a way that\u2019s useful, right? And the way that\u2019s useful is what\u2019s the incremental impact on our profitability, right? And the challenge that we have \u2013 and I\u2019m giving you a background here, but the challenge that we have is that the individual projects each have their own set of metrics. And those metrics may not necessarily directly tied to an incremental EBITDA impact.", "And so we\u2019re looking at ways, various ways to try and back out the things that you shouldn\u2019t count as incremental EBITDA. That\u2019s a long-winded way of saying that I don\u2019t have a specific number for you right here now on the incremental EBITDA impact of each of those projects. What we\u2019ve tried to do is to pick out the ones where we feel like there\u2019s clarity around the incremental EBITDA impact. So obviously, improving the utilization of equipment versus fair market value is true cash flow impact.", "And so we wanted to show that, wanted to show a little bit more of what we\u2019re doing. But I\u2019ll ask for further patience as we try to look for the best way to give you what you\u2019re asking for, which is more concrete pacing about how we\u2019re getting to the $200 million impact.", "Seth Weber", "But is it fair to assume that 2018 is going to be a bigger benefit versus 2017 just to \u2013 as you ramp to that $200 million number? I mean, that seems like a reasonable assumption.", "William Plummer", "Absolutely. That\u2019s fair. The exact quantification of that is what we want to put some more thought to. But what I can say is this, Seth. As we look at how the projects, in aggregate, are tracking versus the targets that were laid out when we kicked off Project XL, we\u2019re performing very nicely against those targets. So the ramp-up on the metrics at each initiative uses is, in aggregate, nicely ahead of the targets that we\u2019ve laid out. But we want to \u2013 when we communicate something out, we want to make sure that it\u2019s useful and clear.", "And right now, there\u2019s just too much analysis and discussion we would have to give in order to relate the measures that we have to the $200 million run rate that we\u2019re targeting. So we\u2019ll ask you again for your patience.", "Seth Weber", "Okay. I\u2019ll ask you again next quarter then.", "William Plummer", "I\u2019m sure, you will.", "Michael Kneeland", "By then, it should be embedded in our guidance.", "Seth Weber", "All right, thanks guys.", "William Plummer", "Thanks Seth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your question please.", "William Plummer", "Steve?", "Steven Fisher", "Thanks, good morning.", "Michael Kneeland", "Good morning.", "Steven Fisher", "I know you guys said that you don\u2019t know what the market\u2019s going to do in terms of CapEx going forward, but to what extent are you actually seeing some discipline and restraint in the market today? And if you are seeing some general discipline, is it more on the pricing side or on the CapEx side? And I\u2019m wondering if given the robustness of the conditions that you\u2019re seeing out there if you would have ordinarily expected to see other players already putting more CapEx into the environment where we are.", "Matt Flannery", "Steve, this is Matt. I would say that we\u2019re seeing both \u2013 we are seeing discipline. We measure it by absorption, and we\u2019ve been seeing that for the entire year, really starting fourth quarter last year that the discipline on the capital spend versus the incremental demand has yielded positive absorption. And we think that\u2019s played out into stabilizing rate and given us the opportunity to get pricing where it was pre-2015. So I would think that the industry has been disciplined on both fronts.", "Steven Fisher", "Is consolidation having any real impact there? And what else do you think is driving it?", "William Plummer", "Yes. That\u2019s a hard one to quantify. I would say sort of based on basic economics that consolidation could be helping. How much? It\u2019s hard to say. What we try to do, though, is just to make sure that we\u2019re looking at the market realistically and we\u2019re taking actions in a disciplined way. And if we continue to do that and if the rest of the industry continues to do that, we certainly think that it should position the industry to perform better.", "Steven Fisher", "Okay. And then can you just remind us the timing of repricing of all your National Account contracts? And if it\u2019s around the next couple of months, what extent would this quarter\u2019s results set you up for stronger pricing as you head into those discussion?", "Matt Flannery", "So it\u2019s not really on a calendar schedule anymore, Steve. We actually intentionally try to address those throughout the cycle. It makes it easier for our team and with the acquisitions that was just some triggers that actually made it necessary to harmonize some set pricing at different times. So there\u2019s not really an annual trigger like maybe four, five years ago where we\u2019re doing everything in Q4 and Q1. It\u2019s a little more spread out.", "Steven Fisher", "Okay. Thank you.", "William Plummer", "Thank you.", "Matt Flannery", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Mr. Kneeland for any further remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. Our third quarter investor presentations are available online if you haven\u2019t had a chance to see it. Obviously, you can reach out to Ted Grace, our Head of IR, with any additional questions. It\u2019s been a busy year, and we\u2019re looking forward to starting 2018 with a lot of momentum, so stay tuned for our next call.

(NYSE:URI) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018 12:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Michael Kneeland - CEO", "William Plummer - CFO", "Matt Flannery - COO", "Analysts", "Ross Gilardi - Bank of America", "Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research", "Joe O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer", "Steven Fisher - UBS", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and welcome to the United Rentals Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Investor Conference Call. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.", "Before we begin, note that the company's press release, comments made on today's call and responses to your questions contain forward-looking statements. The company's business and operations are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and consequently, actual results may differ materially from those projected.", "A summary of these uncertainties is included in the Safe Harbor statement contained in the company's earnings release. For a more complete description of these and other possible risks, please refer to the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as to subsequent filings with the SEC. You can access these filings on the company's website at www.unitedrentals.com. Please note that United Rentals has no obligation and makes no commitment to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements in order to reflect new information or subsequent events, circumstances or changes in expectations.", "You should also note that the company's earnings release, investor presentation and today's call include references to free cash flow, adjusted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a non-GAAP term. Speaking today for United Rentals is Michael Kneeland, Chief Executive Officer; William Plummer, Chief Financial Officer; and Matt Flannery, Chief Operating Officer.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kneeland. Mr. Kneeland, you may begin.", "Michael Kneeland", "Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us in the call this afternoon. I want to start the dialogue today with one word, deliver. Yesterday you saw us report a fourth quarter that more than delivered on expectations, it was a strong end to a record year. But to us delivering is more about looking forward, it's about delivering again in the months ahead. So today we'll connect a momentum we created over the past twelve months with our positive outlook for 2018.", "So looking at the fourth quarter, the most prevalent tailwind was market demand; we leveraged this with two significant acquisitions and a flexible CapEx strategy. As a result our revenue growth in the quarter outperformed the market and that's on a pro forma basis which assumes we owned our acquisitions from 2016 forward. Not only did we grow rental revenue by 11.5% in the quarter, we improved all three underlying metrics; volume was up 8.8% year-over-year and rates improved 2%, time utilization was a solid 70%, up 100 basis points for the quarter. This put up for your time utilization to over 69% which is a new record for us.", "Three months ago I made the observation that the industry background are made to become more constructive and that was clear in December when every one of our regions reported positive year-over-year rates for the first time in years. Our rates are a key driver of growth in returns and are continuing to be a major focus for us in 2018, and it's been a while since we've seen this window of opportunity and I can promise you we won't rest. And here is another point; almost every metric in a fourth quarter performance compares favorably to the full year. Rental revenue for the year was up 7.6% versus 11.5% for the quarter. The quarter outpaced the year on volume, rates and utilization as well. So yes, we delivered on 2017 but more to the point or poised to build on that in 2018.", "Now Bill will review our guidance but I want to take a minute to comment on the free cash flow line. Like most companies we're working through the estimated impacts of the U.S. tax reform. We anticipate a meaningful benefit to free cash flow, our Board is considering the potential uses of the extra cash but no decisions have been made yet. That being said we have many options available and we're always very disciplined about our capital allocations. Any decisions we make will be consistent with our focus on balancing growth and returns to maximize long-term value.", "Premise of our 2018 guidance; strong operating environment. Now frame two questions that cover the basics; first, well our core business and our specialty segment continue to see solid demand in 2018. And second, will this demand be driven by a healthy rental cycle without relying on natural disasters, legislation or other events. In our opinion, the answer to both these questions is yes. Our core general rental business is performing extremely well, commercial construction remains robust and we're seeing continued strength in rig infrastructure which has been a strategic focus of ours for more than a year. In fact, our revenue growth in this vertical has been outpacing market growth.", "Our infrastructure contracts run the gamut from airport renovations in New York and New Jersey to roads and bridges in Texas, and a pipeline work in the central region. States and municipalities are finding the money to make critical infrastructure repairs, and if Washington comes up with funding for public works that money will benefit future years. In other verticals a large number of energy related projects has been at present supplies, it's encouraging to see oil prices stabilize in the 60's and corporate construction is going strong; this includes large corporate campuses and data centers. There is over $4 billion of data center construction scheduled for Virginia D.C. area alone, and tax reform encourage more corporate spending possibly as early as 2019. More immediately, there are signs of that plant turnarounds could ramp up later this year and this should benefit -- would benefit our industrial business.", "Internally, all of our region submitted market outlooks that are bullish on 2018. Perhaps the most important is the customer sentiment is positive and on the rise; almost 66% of our customers surveyed in December described their outlook is improving. This was the strongest reading in almost four years and in fact, the quarter as a whole showed sizeable gains in customer confidence, both sequentially and year-over-year. In Western Canada which has been an economic outlier our team reports that customer sentiment is positive for the first time in three years.", "Turning to our specialty segment; our trench, power and pumps operations gave significant ground in the fourth quarter. As reported, segment rental revenue was up almost 39% year-over-year primarily on same-store basis. The gross rental margin increased 230 basis points to 47.5% for the segment. The plan for this year is to open at least 18 specialty branches and continue to grow this very successful arm of our strategy; and this follows the 16 cold starts that we opened last year. So that's a backdrop for 2018, a number of promising dynamics underscored by broad-based demand in a healthy cycle. And this is consistent with virtually every key indicator for our industry.", "By given the level of customer activity we've earmarked up to $1.95 billion of gross rental CapEx this year; and as we consistently demonstrated to our investors we maintain a high standard for the use of capital and we'll be keeping a close eye on market trends and we're not -- we won't hesitate to adjust our CapEx up or down, if necessary.", "Another tailwind for us in 2018 will be the added capacity we brought on board last year. Our acquisition of NES [ph] last April gave us greater density on the East Coast, Gulf and Midwest, and further entrenched our brand as an aerial supplier. With NES, we gained a strategic position in earthmoving with almost a 40% increase in dirt equipment. Our general rent segment has been able to sell more effectively the vertical such as infrastructure and disaster recovery with this fleet. And in addition, we expanded our specialty offering with smaller acquisitions focused on power equipment and site services.", "Our larger organization stands the benefit for every growth initiative we take going forward. For example, we're making significant investments in the future of customer service to innovation. Our digital technology is one enhanced the way we gain and retain customers and manage change. One major development we have underway is a single digital platform to integrate all of our customer facing technologies; this includes online ordering, account management, GPS analytics, use of equipment sales, [indiscernible] sales, total control asset management, and our United Academy training portal. We're also leveraging the data we harvest in areas like telematics and so one of the many ways we help our customers become more productive in their use of equipment.", "And that's just as important as that you understand why we're making these investments. Today more than ever customer service is a moving target, the spaces we operate are constantly evolving, it's critical that we give customers multiple ways to work with us and we must anticipate the needs for tomorrow's job sites. The investments we're making are intended to deliver tangible business benefits over the long-term. So as you can see 2017 was one step forward after another, it was our busiest year but it was also our safest year on record. Our total recordable incident rate for 2017 was just 0.78 making it the fourth year in a row our rate was below 1; and this speaks to the caliber of our people and our culture.", "You may have noticed that culture is getting a lot of attention lately in the business world. Lots of us talk about what it takes to achieve employee engagement and sustainability, and other attributes of good corporate citizenship. Well, I'm proud to say these are all part of our core values. United Rentals has a long history as a purpose driven company, our employees are personally invested in our vision. The last quarter I spoke about our United Compassion Fund which is the way our employees help each other. We also support the National Association of Women in Construction and we've been advocating for military veterans for over a decade lending our support to numerous causes. And just recently, we were ranked number 7 in the nation as a top military friendly employer across all industries.", "Years ago when we first made culture a priority we decided that the best way to create sustainable value was to bring together the interest of our investors, our customers and our employees as one cohesive company and as a result all stakeholders are well served by our success; that's how we delivered a record year in 2017, now it's our time to do it again.", "So with that I'll ask Bill to cover the quarter and recap the year and then we'll take your questions. So over to you Bill.", "William Plummer", "Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everybody. We've got a lot of topics to go over in this quarter, so I may send out some of the normal commentary we do but please if I skip over anything of interest raise it in Q&A.", "Michael gave a lot of the pro forma's for the full year performance, so most of my comments will be focused on as reported data, I'll call out the pro forma's where I think it adds to the understanding. I'll start with the rental revenue as always; a $1.646 billion was the rental revenue in the quarter, that's up 27% or $348 million versus last year. The breakdown started with the ancillary and re-rent, those two combined were up $51 million year-over-year. Ancillary was the big driver and that reflected primarily the volume of delivery fuel and Rental Protection Program revenue that we had from the addition of NES and NAF. Certainly, we continue to drive delivery realization as well in the base business; those were the main drivers of that 51 increase between those two items.", "OER was the remainder; within OER volume was up $322 million reflecting the nearly 29% growth in OEC on rent that Mike called out our rate was $12 million contributor as well year-over-year as positive rate of 1.1% in the quarter on as reported basis. The pro forma rate realization in the quarter is 2% and that's certainly is encouraging as we go into 2018. Replacement CapEx inflation, we call $17 million reflecting our normal inflation and mix and other was a headwind of about $20 million in the quarter as well; so the net of all of those added together gives you the $348 million change on rental revenue in the quarter.", "Quickly moving to used equipment sales; another good quarter for us in the used equipment with $172 million in proceeds, that's up $37 million versus last year or 27% increase. The adjusted gross margin on that revenue was at 57.6% and that's an 8 percentage point improvement over the prior year. Key drivers there, we talked in the past about improving the realization against fair market value and our used equipment sales is one of the project excel initiatives; so that continue to contribute in the current quarter, as well though that the overall market was strong, pricing in the market was strong with pricing as indicated by our proceeds as a percent of OEC coming in at 53.6%, that's up 20 basis points over last year. And I'll remind you that's on very old units that we're selling which we sold units at an average age of about 91 months in the quarter.", "To give you another view of pricing and our used experience; if you just look at our retail sales on used equipment and compare like-for-like units that sold this year versus last year, the pricing on like-for-like units in our retail channel was up about 5% over last year. So again, a good market for used equipment pricing and the demand for volume is still robust so we're able to sell everything that we need to sell.", "Moving to adjusted EBITDA; $947 million in the quarter, that was up $198 million over last year or about a 26% increase. And the margin on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was 49.3%, that improved by about 10 basis points over last year. The components in the bridge of that $198 million increase volume was $216 million contributor on the growth that we talked about, rental rates at EBITDA contributed about $12 million of year-over-year improvement, the ancillary performance I mention contributed about $23 million of EBITDA the used sales performance was another $33 million of positive year-over-year contribution. The headwinds, fee inflation; we'll call that $13 million of headwind versus last year, our usual merit increase of about $6 million and then the bonus accrual across all of the incentive comp programs cost us about $26 million versus last year.", "Mix and other accounts for the other $41 million of headwind and really that mix in other number is a little bigger than normal driven by the fact that we added Neff in the quarter, right, Neff revenue came in fully loaded with all of the costs of Neff as opposed to incremental cost for the other increases in revenue. So put it all together and it explains the $198 million increase in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. The follow-through on adjusted EBITDA was 49.6% in the quarter; I'll remind you that that experienced the headwind of incentive comp adjustment, that $26 million I called out previously; if you take that out the flow through was about 56% for the quarter.", "Just a touch on Neff a little bit more; we estimate that Neff total revenues in the quarter came in at about $115 million of which about $96 million was rental revenue in the quarter. The EBITDA contribution for Neff we're calling $62 million and that includes the impact of about $3 million in synergies that we realized in the fourth quarter from the Neff acquisition. In fact on the synergy front of that $3 million, the bulk of it came late in the quarter in December; if you annualized what we experienced in synergies, these are pure costs synergies mind you, if you annualize that December result we're at a run rate savings of about $25 million of Neff related synergies. So we're well on our way towards the $35 million cost energy that we called out when we did the Neff acquisition and we certainly expect to deliver that before the end of year two as we called out initially.", "We're also on-track to deliver the procurement savings and it's still early days on all of the revenue synergies that we expect but we certainly haven't seen anything that causes us to believe we won't be able to deliver on all of the synergy targets when we acquired Neff.", "Moving quickly to adjusted EPS; you saw the numbers in the press release, $11.37 for the quarter, I remind you that if that includes the benefit of tax reform we had a positive tax adjustment, I'll touch on it in a minute but if you take out that tax reform aided benefit which was about $8.03 in the quarter you end up with $3.34 on an adjusted after-tax reform basis, that's up 20% versus last year which was $2.67. If you do the same adjustment for the full year you end with an adjusted EPS after the tax benefit of about $10.59 and that's up just over 18% over the prior year. So even taking out the impact of tax reform it's very clear that our EPS performance is nicely higher.", "Free cash flow in the quarter; just briefly on that, $983 million for the year that includes however $76 million worth of payments that we made for merger related and restructuring items. If you take that $76 million out obviously that leaves $907 million which is still a very robust free cash flow performance in. So we're very pleased about the free cash flow that we generated in '17 and look forward to an even more robust free cash flow performance in '18.", "I'll skip a lot of the discussion I usually go through on the debt activity in the interest of time but certainly we discussed the actions in our debt portfolio in the press release, redemptions, upsizing ABO, upsizing AR facility, all of that in the quarter made for a very active quarter but the net effect was that we ended the quarter with net debt of $9.1 billion, that's up about $1 billion. Year end was very strong, $1.7 billion of total liquidity made up about $1.3 billion in ABL capacity and the remainder in cash within the business.", "Briefly on the share repurchase program; you saw that we reinitiated our share repurchase activity in Q4, we bought about $28 million worth of shares, that's a little over 167,000 shares in the quarter and certainly left us with about $345 million to repurchase under our existing repurchase authorization at the end of the year. Since the end of the year I'll note that we have also bought another $45 million, so or so during the month of January to-date -- so as we sit today there is about $300 million left on the existing program and as we've said before, we expect to execute the remainder of that program during the course of 2018.", "On ROIC just real briefly, we finished the year with ROIC of 8.8% that's a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year. And just to give you a sense of the impact of tax reform on ROIC, it will be significant. So if the 21% federal tax rate had been in effect for all of 2017 that 8.8% ROIC would have come out at 10.7% as calculated; so obviously a very significant impact based on the way that we calculate ROIC looking back over the prior four quarters. As we go forward through 2018 the effect of that tax reform change will gradually increase our ROIC as reported, so in the quarters coming we'll be sure to call out both the actual calculation but also the calculation assuming that the 21% federal rate had been in effect for the full period.", "Briefly on tax reform; I want to try not to get too deep into this one but just want to make sure that several things are clear. First in the impact on 2017, there was a significant tax benefit that our deferred tax liability for the new lower tax rate, that rival adjustment was about $746 million. Separately we also recognized $57 million of additional transition tax to cover the transaction payment associated with our foreign earnings, the net of those two was what you saw flowing through our fourth quarter tax line. If you take those out of our fourth quarter tax expense the full year effective tax [Technical Difficulty] to the investor deck where we added another example of a project XL initiative and how we think about the value that it's contributing, this one focused on our sales optimization effort that involves assigning more single point responsibility for key accounts.", "Finally guidance; you saw the guidance that we issued in the press release -- I won't go through all the numbers but maybe it would be helpful to talk about the adjusted EBITDA guidance and give you a framework for thinking about the range that we put out. If you look at -- let's use the midpoint of that adjusted EBITDA guidance, so 36.75; and look at the components that lead you to that midpoint from our 2017 actual experience. We call it this way, the addition of any S&F for the periods that we didn't know last year would add about $180 million worth of EBITDA just from the businesses as we bought them last year; so assuming no growth they would add about $180 million in 2018.", "The other acquisitions would add another roughly $10 million or so to get us to a new baseline for the acquired businesses. If on top of that you added synergies for any S&F which combined or about $50 million, call it $20 million NES, $30 million for Neff, you get another $50 million on top. Our bonus reset will be a tailwind for us in 2018, it will be about $30 million less expense than we had in '17 so added $30 million on top of that. Our used equipment sales will go up a little bit in 2018, so in our net rental CapEx guidance we called out an impact of about $600 million of used equipment proceeds in 2018. If you take a 50% margin, apply to that just as a rough estimate that adds another $25 million year-over-year.", "And for the remainder, if you just assumed a simple 6% rental revenue growth at a 60% flow-through -- all of those assumptions take you right to the midpoint of our guidance range. Whether we do 6% rental revenue growth or more or less we'll leave to your own imagination as analysts but we wanted to frame the guidance range that we gave for adjusted EBITDA in a way that lets you see the broad impacts of some of the specific items and gets you in the neighborhood of what we think the year will look like.", "Finally, just a comment on free cash flow and capital allocation; there is a lot of interest and what are we going to do with all this cash flow; we're guiding to $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion of free cash flow as the range for 2018. I think it's fair to say that as we look at the possible uses of that cash flow our mindset for how to make decisions about capital allocations has not changed. We still want to make sure first and foremost that the leverage of our business is appropriate for where we are in the cycle, we believe the answer to that is yes. Then we want to make sure that we're making the right decision about the amount of organic growth to put it in the business through CapEx is appropriate, we believe the range that we've given you for CapEx is very appropriate in the market environment we expect.", "M&A is always part of our thinking about uses for cash flow and we certainly will be ready to do acquisitions that makes sense but they need to make sense, we've been very disciplined about that. And finally share repurchase, we've talked about completing the existing program $300 million remaining as we sit today; whether and how much more we might do beyond that is the subject of a discussion that we'll continue to have with the board as we go forward throughout the course of the year. If we deliver the guidance that we talked about here, we should finish the year with our leverage ratio of something like 2.2 times at the end of the year, that would be very low versus the range that we've historically talked about it 2.5 to 3.5 times. So we'll have a very active discussion throughout the year about where we allocate the use of this cash flow and what level of leverage we think is appropriate for where we are in the cycle.", "Like I said, a lot of topics, so let me stop there but if there is anything that I missed please raise it in Q&A. So Operator, can we open the call for Q&A?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi. Your line is open.", "Ross Gilardi", "I just want to kick-off with the free cash question just Bill as you were going through those details; but look at -- your guidance right now, your EBITDA and free cash conversion looks like it's 35% to 40% at least for 2018 but looking further out is there any reason that you can't hold that level of conversion for the next several years because if EBITDA continues to grow you're presumably kicking off $1.5 billion for year on consensus numbers for the foreseeable future. So I just wanted to get your reaction to that thought process? Is there any reason why that cash conversion should really change materially in the next couple of years?", "Michael Kneeland", "Ross I'd say that there is nothing really unusual other than the impact of tax reform, nothing else unusual driving our free cash realization. So I think that story might be told by the impact of tax reform. Remember that the 100% depreciation under tax reform goes away after five years, so at some point that benefit is going to be reduced. Remember also that they placed caps on the amount -- the percentage of EBITDA that you need to be below in order to still deduct interest expense, we are below that cap currently but that cap changes from a percent of EBITDA to a percent of EBIT at some point in the next few years. And depending on where we are in our profitability and our leverage it may have an impact as well but those are the things that I think over the future years -- the unusual things that might impact the cash conversion outside of just our normal operating performance.", "Ross Gilardi", "Just on the supply demand balance for rental equipment; if the market was excessively tight after the hurricanes, do you feel like we've come back into balance as you've pulled forward some CapEx and clearly it's the seasonally softer time of the year but do you feel like price momentum has got subside in the first half of '18 -- more when you get into the spring months as you pulled forward some your CapEx?", "Matt Flannery", "I wouldn't say that there has been an extraordinary tightness due to the hurricanes, maybe in a few markets but we felt all year demand was -- that the combination of demand and the disciplined supply of the industry really played into the dynamic of great opportunity and better time utilization; and we see that continuing and we're forecasting that to continue throughout 2018. As far as -- we maybe a little bit lighter on the cadence of our 2018 CapEx growth; so we might bring in a little bit less than normal in Q1 just because we brought more in Q4 than we usually would but other than that no real impact on our full year thoughts about CapEx where we get back to more normal cadence.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. Your line is open.", "Rob Wertheimer", "I had two questions if I may. The first is just on dirt as a relative attractiveness; I mean there is a lot of signs with the used equipment etcetera that the dirt is maybe tight. I don't think there is any structural improvement there and obviously if you've mixed the fleet that direction with the acquisition. And then second, all the stuff from both maybe you can just respond as you choose. I love that total control chart that you've got in the slide deck. I mean can you give anecdotes around this; it would appear that you're steadily, steadily growing that base; I don't know if you're losing anybody who has installed or if there's a really good lock-in on it and what people are seeing in terms of benefits and savings as I guess as well as you guys?", "Matt Flannery", "As far as the great observation on the total control value we feel very strongly about it and fortunately the customer response seems to feel strong as well; so that is organic growth and it's as you could see a couple of points higher than what our overall growth is. And I think that's important because although it's not a huge percentage of our customer base they're usually large important strategic customers and we go through that extra effort to add value to them and they do outpace our overall growth. As far as the dirt attractiveness, obviously we like the impact of the Neff acquisition, not just the talent we brought in or the fleet mix but I think the biggest opportunity are the customers that we brought with that. So adding a larger mix of dirt gives an opportunity to serve maybe a broader customer base than we had previously. The net-net impact in dirt fleet, it went from 12% of our overall fleet profile last year to 14% this year and although that is an impact, the bigger impact is the access to those customer bases, especially in key verticals like infrastructure which we're very bullish on.", "Rob Wertheimer", "So can we expect you to continue to invest a little bit in following along with the dirt side?", "Matt Flannery", "Absolutely, especially as the demand continues and we already were to be clear set aside from the Neff acquisitions; the Neff acquisition just gave us a real boost specifically in the larger end of the dirt.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea. Your line is open.", "Joe O'Dea", "First question; you referenced the industrial side of the business. Could you talk about what portion of your revenues are really made up of the industrial side and then what you've seen over the past couple of years whether that's more stabilization or whether that's kind of moving off of a bottom and just trying to appreciate what kind of recovery we could see there?", "William Plummer", "So just the aggregate industrial have to pull a number together but the key areas for us as we think about growth going forward, chemical processing certainly is an attractive growth area for us. The manufacturing might be a little slower this year, metals and mining and minerals we think could be a nice growth area for us as we go forward as well. And then power pulp, paper and wood products will probably contribute as we go forward as well. Oil and gas, if you want to call that industrial has been a growth area for us, upstream activity had a nice growth in 2017 given the impact of oil pricing and drilling activity, the upstream part of that will be a growth area for us.", "Midstream and downstream will depend on -- quite honestly on the timing of some of the turnarounds in the refinery complex, that timing is always a little bit of a wild card for us but certainly we have reason to be somewhat optimistic that that will be a growth area for us as well. So hopefully that's useful.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would just add additionally that the capital spending forecast for what is the largest part of our industrial business is petrochem are both positive for 2018 and 2019; so we're encouraged about that as well.", "Joe O'Dea", "Michael, you're occasionally asked about interest in expanding internationally; I think you usually address that is something down the road but certainly don't eliminate the possibility. And when you think about the kind of cash that you're looking at generating over the next few years, does that in any way influence how you think about the timing of potentially -- expanding some of your growth to overseas?", "Michael Kneeland", "The fact that we've had the capital available to us, not only coming into this year in 2018 but we've had it for quite some time. It really to me is going to be predicated on our customers, the customer demand and wanting us to go beyond. We talked about total control, there are a lot of Fortune 500 companies that we are engaged with and using our digital front. And that may be the impetus to get us beyond North America but there is no footrace and as Bill mentioned about acquisitions, they will be what they will be and they would be under the same scrutiny that we've always gone through it. But still plenty of opportunity in North America but we never say never and when the time is right or the customer is prepared, we'll be prepared to go what them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Raso. Your line is open.", "David Raso", "I'm just trying to think about the commitment you've usually had to 2.5 to 3.5 leverage. I mean, Bill you've been there for 10 years and every single year you've been there the company has never ended the year below two and a half net debt to EBITDA. And if you look at logical thought of where you're EBITDA is at '19 -- I mean your net debt to EBITDA is usually down like one-eight. I mean you're literally talking about $2.5 billion to $3 billion to put to work; are we still committed to where I shouldn't expect to not end below $2.5 billion net to EBITDA either of those two years? I mean at this level you could -- the next 24 months buyback over 15% of the stock. I'm just trying to understand are we still committed to something that you've always done, you've never ended a year since they hired in '08, below 2.5 net debt to EBITDA.", "William Plummer", "David, I think -- I don't -- I can't get too far out on this discussion because honestly I can't get that far ahead of our board but I think we've made a compelling case in the past that 2.5, 3.5 is a good range; we have always said that we're not afraid to go a little above that for the right deal or a little below that depending on where we are in the cycle. So it's not like gets a religiously set number to say 2.5 is the absolute lowest. That said, if it were Bill Plummer's world, 1.8 is too low, right; I believe we selected that 2.5 to 3.5 range because it represents our view of a good balance between efficiency of the capital structure and management of the risk against the cycle, right. Getting much, much below 2.5 starts to become more inefficient and you don't get much in terms of protection against the downturn.", "So that would be the argument I would make to the board but the board has their perspective on this issue right, and so going through that and discussing it and coming together on a point of view is what the process is that we're going to go through to decide where we end up in terms of the leverage. And it's going to be live and up by the fact that there may be deals that come along or the market strength may indicate that we need to spend more on capital as we go along. So I'd say stay tuned is the way to think about it but certainly we're very pleased to be in a position where we can think about all these things at very large scale.", "David Raso", "So as you said in the Bill Plummer world, this Slide 20, 2.5 to 3.5 is still the way to think about the company and you're not going to deviate off of that for too long and you've not heard anything from the board to suggest they want to delever the company beyond this framework; is that a fair assessment for now?", "William Plummer", "I think the fair assessment is to say we don't live in Bill Plummer world. So at least not Bill Plummer world alone; so I'd just point you to stay tuned David and we'll talk about it as we develop that thought process.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger. Your line is open.", "Michael Kneeland", "Scott, you're on mute or operator are we have any difficulties?", "Operator", "No. Please standby. Mr. Schneeberger your line is open.", "Scott Schneeberger", "Mike, I was curious in your comments about plant turnarounds later this year; it's kind of something that people have been waiting for -- I'm just curious if you could delve into that a little bit more and is that something that you're expecting and perhaps in guidance or is that something that's -- that would be an upside? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Scott, there is a lot of positive industrial macro indicators that are out there, number one. And I'm not going to list them all because I think you know who they all are but they are uniformly positive, number one. Number two, just looking at some of the other resources \u2013 IR [ph], they are looking at the value of maintenance projects and capital projects as increasing; so we take those along with what we get back from their regions and our customers -- what they have on their books and what they're seeing. So we take all that to frame up our comments.", "Scott Schneeberger", "And then I'm curious on the progress report on online rental systems; just -- it's been a couple of years now and wondering how far have all decided [ph] and where that's going to go? Thanks.", "Michael Kneeland", "As far as where it is today we feel very confident and about the capabilities we've built, the customer adoption we know is going to be a longer cycle; so it's not a big piece of our revenue right now and it's a pretty good mix of new customers versus existing customers. What we truly believe and why we've invested in this area is this is going to be the price of entry in the future, and not just for new customers but we think a lot of our existing customers will break more and more technology; so we view this as a must have long-term which is why we made the investment and we're seeing good early signs of the people that are adopting it, it's still a small percentage of our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jerry [ph]. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Pricing was stronger than normal seasonality for you folks; in the fourth quarter I'm wondering if you can talk about how broad-based was -- it was the pricing strength versus normal seasonality and can you give us some context in terms of feedback you're hearing from the marketplace into January?", "Matt Flannery", "I think you can look to Slide 7, we actually give you a three-year sequential pricing grid there if you want to get into the detail later but you're correct, it was better than 2016, we're very encouraged by that. I think it plays off of the demand that we've been discussing on the call today and really throughout the calendar year '17 and we expect that to continue. If you want to delay over or carryover, so -- and we're going to talk about rate pro forma because we think that's the important way to think about it and it's the way we manage internally. We've got a 1.65 carryover going into 2018 -- pro forma. If you overlay the exact experience of sequential rate performance that we had in 2017 over that that would get you to about a 2% year-over-year rate improvement pro forma for '18.", "So we feel that's a good anchoring point; all I would say is that we haven't had a Q4 in a while where every single region had positive sequential performance and we're very pleased with that. Even Canada got to almost flat year-over-year in Q4 which is great for that team that's been fighting headwinds for a few years now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And Matt, it sounds like that momentum is continuing in the early part of the year based on your comments just now and earlier in the call, is that a fair assessment?", "Matt Flannery", "I would say it's as projected, we're not giving in quarter guidance but Q1 always has -- it will be your toughest sequential but it's the year-over-year that we're focused on and trying to maintain that momentum and you know, that's embedded in our conversation, stay tuned for April, you'll get the exact update.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And on your digital platform, can you talk about what kind of recurring business you're getting out of it? So is it truly transactional one-off new client signing up or what do the usage statistics look like for you on that presumably? With your footprint you folks are better positioned than most in that platform and I'm wondering if you're seeing the level of statistics on the recurring business that are supportive or is it mostly transactional?", "Matt Flannery", "So as far as recurring, as I stated to Scott it's about 50-50; existing account customers and new customers joining in and they overtime convert to account customers but it is very broad geographically, product mix and even duration of rental. I would -- it's certainly a higher percentage of transactional than our overall base business because we have such a large base of key account business but I'm very surprised by how much recurring business and long-term rentals we're getting through that as a percentage as well.", "Michael Kneeland", "The only thing I would add to that is, the digital era is here and it's going to grow overtime. And if you take a look at the total control, order entry for our customers and even internally for -- whether it be our sales force, the digital component is going to grow. What we've been doing is we've put everything under one unified platform so everything comes together in a more customer-friendly environment; so it's not only -- like I said in my opening comments, it's not just a digital -- if they want used equipment, if they want to go into safety training, rent equipment -- find information on their fleet through telematics, this is all coming together under one uniform platform that we have built and we're rolling out. There will be more to come and more update as we make progress but it's an investment that we're making for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher. Your question please.", "Steven Fisher", "Just talk a little bit more about what's driving the shift to positive pricing year-over-year? How much of that is mix including the oil or activity or recovery versus just general tightness for all the across the market versus some of the analytics approaches that you've been doing or anything else?", "Matt Flannery", "Steve, it has been very broad, it is not any one segment, any one geography, any one vertical. Although we have had oil and gas growth to put in perspective it's still less than 5%; the upstream is still less than 5% of our overall revenue and I don't think it has -- certainly hasn't yet and I don't truly think that will ever get to the rate levels that it had previously, right; we're not going to have that oil rush in upstream again. I think everybody understands including the operator -- that wasn't a healthy way to operate and I don't see that recurring. So it's really been lifted by just -- by broad-based demand and as I mentioned, every region in the company had sequential positive rates in Q4.", "Michael Kneeland", "I would say that it's also as you know -- the industry is overall is reacting positively; so I think I've mentioned this in several calls in the past that our industry is becoming more sophisticated and smarter, and knows about returns and so that's a good sign and I think you'll probably hear others as well talk about it.", "Steven Fisher", "And then if I could just follow-up on a question that Joe O'Dea asked earlier; if you could talk a little bit more about the process industry activity in the Gulf Coast, specifically in 2017 versus 2016? How did that look on a year-over-year basis for rental? And then I know you mentioned there's a number of petrochemical projects that you see in the works out there -- what have you embedded in your guidance for sort of the timing of all that happening and Gulf Coast '18 versus '17?", "Matt Flannery", "So specifically in the Gulf Coast I would call the first half of '17 was a little bit tougher than the back half; we actually saw improvement in Q4 in petrochem. I think going forward more importantly the capital spending forecast are up in both, higher in chemical, I mean we're talking about plus 30% capital project spending in chemical and almost double-digit in refining and those are really the two big buckets of business that we focused on in the Gulf Coast industrial business. So I think it's -- we can call it flattish to slightly up overall in '17 over '16 but encouraged and planning to do better in '18.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer.", "Rob Wertheimer", "I just wanted to ask a philosophical question on investment in technology. I mean do you view this is something that you keep spending as a constant percentage of sales? As you're seeing -- I mean your scale is obviously growing a lot with the acquisitions and the growth we're doing. And so you keep spending and see a widening gap versus folks or do you accelerate it maybe because it just enhances the sustainable margin/locking advantage you have versus folks or is there eventually scale on the technology spend that you've been ramping up for the past two or three years.", "Michael Kneeland", "Well, I think it will be a combination of all of the above. For example; the investment we made in telematics and now educating the end user on the benefits of what they can get out of it and making that information for them available in a format that they can get and manipulate as need be, that'd be one. With regards to companies trying to find ways to control their cost, drive better time utilization or efficiencies in their plants or on those job sites; that's another form by which we do. And then you know we talk about safety, our United Academy of making sure that we're connecting not only equipment but people as well, that I think is going to pay dividends for us as a company in entangling our customers in a way that I don't know what my competitors are doing but what we know is that you know the digital communication is important, it's real-time, is giving them data, it requires them just to log-on where -- I'd far as I know were one of the few if not the only that you can order deliver, return and never talk to anybody and for some people in programming their jobs that's very attractive. Not everyone has a staff. So we're trying to touch as broad audience as we can and we're specializing in areas like -- we talked about total control but there are benefits that we think that will yield us a lot more in the longer term.", "We will continue to invest, the board is very supportive of thinking about digital and how we can think differently and helping our customers become more productive. That's what we do for a living, that's our job.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ramsay Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I guess I'm just thinking about your expansion plans for specialty for the next year and maybe even beyond; is the competition in this segment getting intense enough as more rental companies try to execute growth here. Is the competition making Greenfield expansion or bolt-on expansion harder or less attractive?", "Michael Kneeland", "This is always competition. I think it makes us smarter, makes us more customer-centric, makes us have to think about what we bring to a value proposition. I never assume anything and so we have to make sure that we're listening to the customer and making sure we're meeting that demand. Some of our competitors are doing some other similar things that we're doing. But it's up to us to sting out how we can make a smarter or better mousetrap to capture that customer. We're broad, we have a broad customer reach and how we can leverage our customer through our cross-sell I think is something that we are doing exceptionally well and we'll continue to leverage on that.", "Matt Flannery", "I would only at now certainly remains attractive and a prioritized focus for us in investment. We're going to do another 18 cold starts in specialty in 2018 and that's on top of the sixteen net we did this past year, so it still remains very tracked and I'll make sure that's clicker. But if the competition is getting stronger we're getting better because our growth rates are still pretty robust.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Michael Kneeland", "Thanks, operator. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, as you can see we're excited about 2018, we expect to report solid progress in the coming quarters. In the meantime, as you -- you can always call Ted Grace, how is our Head of IR with any questions you may have and I urge you also to go on the website and download or look at our investor presentation that we have online. So that wraps up for today, so operator you can please end the call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Certainly, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.
