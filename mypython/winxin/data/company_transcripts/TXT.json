(NYSE:TXT) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2017  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Eric Salander - VP of IR", "Scott Donnelly - Chairman and CEO", "Frank Connor - CFO", "Analysts", "Peter Arment - Robert W. Baird", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup", "Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Robert Stallard - Vertical Recearch", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Sam Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Operator", "Welcome to the Textron Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this point, I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead, sir.", "Eric Salander", "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the investor relations section of our website.", "Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.8 billion, down $98 million from last year's fourth quarter. During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded an $8 million pre-tax charge, or $0.02 per share after tax, related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.80 per share, down $0.01 from last year's fourth quarter.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $727 million, compared to $534 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, revenues were $13.8 billion, up 2.7% from a year ago. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $2.62 per share, up 4.8% from $2.50 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $573 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up at Systems and Industrial, but down at Bell and Aviation, which led to an overall decrease in revenues in the quarter. Despite the decline in revenues, we're encouraged by increasing demand in Industrial, the ramp on TAPV deliveries, and strong operating performance at Bell.", "Bell revenues were down on lower commercial military volumes for the quarter. Despite the lower volumes in the quarter, we continued to execute, which led to a strong 14% margin. We delivered 35 commercial helicopters, down from 56 in last year's fourth quarter; 4 B-22s, down from 8 units last year; and 8 H-1s, down from 9 last year.", "On the new product front, our V-280 Valor program continues to progress and is on track for first flight this year. On the commercial side, we're continuing to see signs of stabilization of the market through improved order flow. Our new 505 Jet Ranger X achieved type certification from Transport Canada Civil Aviation at the end of 2016, with follow-on FAA certification anticipated in the first quarter of 2017. We've seen strong conversion of LOIs to orders on the 505 and expect solid deliveries beginning in the first quarter.", "On the service side, we're experiencing a positive reception to our Customer Advantage Plans, including the signing of Heliservicio's fleet of 20 Bell 412s. Moving to Systems, revenues were up on higher volumes, primarily at Marine and Land Systems. The higher volumes were driven by the ongoing ramp of TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter.", "At our Unmanned Systems business, we recently were awarded two significant contracts that display our customers' confidence in our products and support network. The first award was a $206 million contract for ongoing logistics support and sustainment on our Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System. Second, to be the sole provider of services with our Aerosonde mid-endurance unmanned aircraft for an amount of $475 million over the next several years in support of US special operations.", "At our TRU Simulation training business, we delivered our first 737 Max full-flight sim to Boeing's pilot training camps in Miami as part of our 10-year exclusive agreement. We continue to look for ways to leverage our platforms across our businesses, and we recently opened our Bell Helicopter Training Academy in Valencia, Spain with EASA certification of our 429 sim. Our Citation M2 and CJ4 simulators received FAA qualification in the quarter, joining the Latitude and CJ3+ at our TRU US-based training centers.", "Moving to Industrial, we saw a 3.8% increase in revenue, reflecting the impact of higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles. As we look to continue our expansion in the powersports market and build on our recent product introductions, today we announced an agreement to acquire Arctic Cat, one of the industry's most recognized brands. This acquisition will immediately broaden our product portfolio as we add a variety of outdoor recreational and utility vehicles to our lineup, as well as an established dealer network.", "Also during the quarter, we released our new four-seat 80 horsepower Textron off-road Stampede XTR, maintaining our new product momentum in the sports utility market. The integration of Jacobsen into our specialized vehicle business is underway and on track to be completed this year.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $52 million. In the quarter, we delivered 58 jets compared to 60 last year and 28 King Airs, down from 33 in last year's fourth quarter.", "For the full year, we delivered 178 jets, up from last year's 166, including 42 Latitude deliveries. The increased Latitude deliveries include both retail customers as well as deliveries to NetJets, and we expect that trend to continue in 2017. Offsetting this growth in Latitude volume were lower deliveries on other Citation models and turboprops, for which we are lowering production in 2017.", "On the new product front, the second aircraft in the Longitude flight test program successfully completed its first flight just over one month after the prototype aircraft. The Longitude has performed very well, and at this year's NBAA, we announced an improved range of 3,500 nautical miles and an improved full fuel payload of 1,600 pounds. We also had a full cabin mock-up of the Citation Hemisphere on display at the show, and continue to believe this aircraft will be a game-changing platform in its segment.", "Moving to the Scorpion program, the first production aircraft had a successful first flight in the quarter and is performing well. Along with its first flight, we achieved a number of significant milestones in the program in 2016. We entered a US Air Force Airworthiness Assessment program, we validated production manufacturing processes, and successfully demonstrated weapons and mission Systems capabilities.", "With these achievements, interest in the Scorpion program is growing both domestically and in international markets. Given the status of the program at the end of 2016, we will transition financial reporting for the Scorpion to the Textron Aviation segment beginning in 2017.", "To summarize, we experienced a challenging year with weaker-than-expected business jet and commercial helicopter markets, but we continue to invest in our businesses through ongoing development of new products and strategic acquisitions to support growth and create long-term value.", "We were able to achieve significant increases in top-line growth at Industrial and Systems, with margin expansion and Systems, Bell, and Industrial. At Industrial, our growth for the year reflected our investment in new products, such as our selective catalytic reduction Systems at Kautex and our Stampede side-by-side sport utility vehicle. We also acquired Premier and SAFEAERO, two manufacturers of aircraft de-icing equipment, that allow us to expand our ground support business portfolio.", "At Textron Systems, we began initial deliveries of our TAPV systems and anticipate delivery of our first ship to shore connector this year. At TRU Simulation and Training, we achieved a number of milestones with initial deliveries of full flight simulators for several models into the commercial, general aviation, and helicopter training markets.", "At Bell, we made substantial progress on the V-280 and announced our latest innovation, the V-247 Vigilant unmanned tiltrotor, further displaying our leadership in tiltrotor technology and our commitment to meeting customer needs. On the H-1 front, we received additional orders from the DOD for 61 units, including 9 FMS units for Pakistan, taking production through the first quarter of 2019. Looking forward, foreign initiatives remain strong and we expect to secure additional contracts in 2017.", "On the commercial side, after a difficult period in the market with several quarters of very low order flow, we saw a significant increase in order activity in the back half of 2016 and we are looking to carry that momentum into 2017 with higher 412 and strong 505 deliveries.", "Textron Aviation, we saw higher Latitude volumes in 2016 and expect this trend to continue in 2017, with higher deliveries to NetJets and retail customers. On Longitude, we entered two aircraft in the flight test program and expect certification at the end of 2017, with deliveries ramping in 2018. We updated design details and performance capabilities for the Cessna Denali and Citation Hemisphere, two platforms that will make incremental revenue as we enter new markets in the coming years.", "To finish with Textron's 2017 financial guidance, we are projecting revenues of about $14.3 billion, as we expect growth in Industrial and Systems, with approximately flat revenue at Bell and Aviation. We expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70, and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in a range of $650 million to $750 million.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $391 million, up $13 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 on a $98-million decrease in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.", "At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $52 million from this period last year, primarily due to lower commercial and defense-related turboprop volumes, partially offset by higher pre-owned volume. Segment profit was $135 million, down from $138 million a year ago. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1 billion, down $73 million from the end of the third quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $148 million, primarily due to lower military and commercial volumes. Segment profit increased $2 million from the fourth quarter in 2015 despite the lower volumes, reflecting favorable performance. Backlog in this segment was $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up $416 million from the end of the third quarter.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $69 million, primarily due to higher Marine and Land Systems volumes. Segment profit was up $12 million, reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $1.8 billion, down $367 million from the end of the third quarter.", "Industrial revenues increased $35 million due to higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles. Segment profit was flat with the fourth quarter of last year. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit increased $2 million.", "Moving below the segment profit, corporate expenses were $56 million compared to $52 million last year. This reflected the impact of a higher stock price on stock-based compensation. Interest expense was $33 million, essentially flat to last year.", "With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded pretax charges of $8 million on the special charges line. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.8 billion.", "For the full year, we repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares at an overall cost of about $241 million. Our Board of Directors also approved a new authorization for the repurchase of up to 25 million shares.", "Let's turn now to our 2017 guidance beginning with our segments on slide 9. At Textron Aviation, we are expecting flattish revenues of about $5 billion, reflecting an increase in pre-owned aircraft volumes and Latitude deliveries, offset by lower defense-related turboprop volumes. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the Scorpion transition, reflecting the change in mix. We expect the Scorpion program expense to be about $50 million for the year.", "Looking to Bell, we expect overall revenues will be essentially flat at about $3.3 billion, reflecting higher H-1 deliveries, offset by lower V-22 revenues and spares on the military side, and flattish revenues on the commercial side. We are forecasting a margin of approximately 11%.", "At Systems, we're estimating 2017 revenues of about $1.9 billion, up 8% from last year, reflecting a full year of TAPV deliveries and growth at TRU, partially offset by lower volumes at unmanned systems and weapons and sensors, as we exit the SFW product line. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8.5%. The lower margin in 2017 reflects the impact of lower SFW activities and higher TAPV volumes.", "At Industrial, we're expecting growth in each of our businesses, resulting in projected segment revenue growth of 5% to about $4 billion, with an estimated margin of approximately 9%. As Scott discussed earlier, we've entered into an agreement to acquire Arctic Cat, and we will update our 2017 outlook to include this transaction following its close. At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit of about $20 million.", "Turning to slide 10, based on US pension discount rate of 4.25%, we're estimating 2017 pension costs to be flat with last year at about $81 million. Turning to slide 11, R&D is expected to be about $495 million, down from $582 million in 2016. We are expecting CapEx will be about $440 million, approximately flat with last year.", "Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 12, we're projecting about $115 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated at $140 million. We are assuming a tax rate of about 30%, and our guidance assumes a share count of about 270 million shares. So that concludes our prepared remarks. Brad, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Scott, I wanted to pursue Aviation to some extent. First, I mean on the third quarter you commented you expected fourth quarter deliveries to be above last year's fourth quarter. Were any of those delayed into early this year as people may have hopes that we get better tax depreciation? And two, if you can just go through what you are seeing in the market now. Are you seeing an improvement in GDP growth, business confidence is up - are well behaved at this point, pricing seems like it's getting better so I would've thought that we would start to see some more improvement then evidently you are forecasting in 2017 guidance.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure George, let me start with the fourth-quarter and I think what we saw in the fourth quarter was obviously continued strength on the Latitude side. Aircraft is doing very well and demand has been strong both on the fractional side through NetJet as well as retail. I would say on the rest of the Citation family, as we went through the fourth quarter we saw a lot of price pressure and folks wanting to see lower pricing in the aircraft and what you see is that we didn't hit the volume because frankly we are not willing to go to the price levels where some people wanted to go in order to get deals done.", "I think the pricing on these right now remains very attractive. It remains depressed even going back into 2008 days and to levels we are just not willing to go so what happened is that we traded out of some volume because it was priced at a level we are not willing to accept. In fact in addition to that it's part of the reason - forecast this year. While we will still have continued growth on the Latitude side based on its demand, we are pulling back on the production volumes and unit volumes for 2017 for a lot of these other aircraft because again we are not willing to go to the price levels where people seem to want to go.", "Now in terms of Outlook in terms of the economy I don't think there's any question that if we see things happen with respect to corporate tax rates and regulation and all these things which I think frankly we all feel pretty good about, that that can make a material impact on GDP, that will help to create more confidence and more demand and if that demand comes back and it's willing to pay, you know, a fair price on the aircraft that we will address that at the time but we haven't seen that yet and so we walked from pursuing lower prices to get deals done in the fourth quarter and we will reflect that in lower pricing volumes going into 2017.", "George Shapiro", "The book to bill looked like it was around.95. Was that - did that improve after the election or was there any color you can give us?", "George Shapiro", "The book to bill looked like it was around 0.95. Was that - did that improve after the election or any color through the quarter you can give us?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I am not disappointed with the book to bill, George. It's always tough to get the book to bill in the fourth quarter to be - predict it strong, and usually it's weaker, frankly, I think, right? Because you see a lot of sales that's in Q4 and order activity doesn't usually pick up until after the first of the year.", "In other words, if people are going to do something, they tend to want to do it within the quarter for the fourth quarter. So I'm comfortable with our book to bill in terms of where we're going in the year. But again, we just - from a volume market perspective, it's a little bit of a wait and see, and we're going to adjust accordingly in the meantime.", "George Shapiro", "And one quick one for Frank. How much of aftermarket up in the Aviation area?", "Frank Connor", "Aftermarket was up, in part due to the reflection of the Able transaction. When you take that out, it was flattish.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Scott, Frank, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the acquisition and the potential accretion and synergies and the longer-term strategic view of this particular market segment.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. I think that this is a great opportunity for us. We have been investing organically here over the last couple of years to move more into the consumer side of the vehicle business. Our vehicle business, obviously, has been performing really well in the golf side, the Industrial side, and our own consumer piece of the business.", "But the consumer business, in general is a very large market. We have been fairly under-represented in that area. We have a great product line up with our personal transport vehicles under the E-Z-GO brand that does very well; it's a very nice business for us.", "We wanted to get into the higher performance more off-road side of the business. We invested in the Stampede; it's a fantastic vehicle. We're really pleased with that vehicle, but we've been trying to build out the dealer side, the distribution side, which is a different distribution channel than that which we have in the rest of our vehicle business.", "So opportunistically, look this is a business that's been challenged in the last couple of years. The industry frankly, after a lot of years of growth that was - had some issues this year just in terms of the economy and lack of net growth.", "The snow side of the business, obviously, had a couple of bad winters. On the dirt side they had just, again, as an industry, not unique to Arctic Cat, a lot of stuff built up in the channel. And I think it's a business that has tremendous opportunities going forward, but it's been in a bit of a tough time unwinding and managing their way through a lot of the inventory issues, and frankly, positioning themselves for future growth.", "So when we looked at the company - if you look at the products that we have today and the products that we've had in development, and you look at the products they have today and the products, frankly, which they have in the development pipeline, it's just a beautiful fit. I think that dealers and customers are going to be really impressed over the next couple of years about what that product line looks like. I think it will be a very attractive line for dealers.", "I think a lot of progress has been made with respect to the channel. That work will have to continue after we acquire it, I think, through the first year to really get that repositioned and ready to go.", "So I think long term, we see this as a mid-single-digit growth business. I think we get a lot of synergies and a lot of leverage in terms of the operations, as well as, again, just fortuitously where we were really investing and where they were investing are very, very highly complementary. So I think the combined entity will have a great product lineup, a great dealer network, and I think it's really poised to deliver some nice growth going forward.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. As far as near-term accretion, dilution, when do you expect to turn on that? And then, Frank, can just talk a little bit about the cash flow conversion for the year and the puts and takes that are going on there for 2017? Thanks, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, so look, on the dilution front, again, we don't have a hard number yet because we don't know when the deal closes. But if you assume it's going to close sometime toward the end of the quarter, which I don't think is unreasonable, we need to go through our regulatory issues, but I am not expecting any issues there.", "The issue right now is, and what's really been driving their performance as well as a lot of their competitor's performance, has been this issue of this clearing out a lot of the older product in the channel through rebating, and that's put a lot of pressure on their margins. So I expect to see that continue through the balance of this year once we pick up the company. So I'm guessing we're probably going to see somewhere around $0.10 dilution in 2017, with clear accretion in 2018 and beyond. Frank, you can talk to the cash conversion.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. In terms of overall cash conversion for both 2016 and then going into 2017, in 2016, obviously, we ended strong after a weaker start to the year. We're looking for an increase, as we indicated, in cash and cash flow conversion going into 2017.", "Obviously some of that has to do with the continuing ramp-up of the TAPV deliveries, as we talked about. It also has to do with the production modification that Scott mentioned at Aviation on the legacy lines and some better performance on the inventory front there. And so, we're looking for an improvement there.", "As it relates to Arctic Cat, it will have some impact on that cash flow number, but not all that material of an impact in terms of the cash flow impact of the acquisition.", "Scott Donnelly", "Year one, as you guys could expect, normal purchase accounting and inventory values and all that stuff will create some dilution, some of which will still be a cash impact, but a great deal of it won't be.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Scott, just a question for you on the Scorpion. It seems like you're making some good progress there. Can you talk about whether or not this is the make-or-break year for the product, and then just any opportunities around the change in administration?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. Look, I think the team made huge progress last year on some really, really important milestones. Obviously, we always knew we could make a good aircraft. One of the biggest risks was always around how you get a certification. Clearly, last year with the Air Force putting a program office together and getting under contract with them to perform the airworthiness work was a gigantic milestone. Having the conforming aircraft now flying and really working our way through our production processes so it's not just a prototype, but something that's ready to turn the button and move into production was a big milestone.", "And look, a lot of what we were working on was trying to position ourselves for opportunities, both internationally and domestically. As we've made those milestones, we have a lot of conversation going internationally. And I think you've all seen probably from a US standpoint, Senator McCain and his wish list of future budgets, and the Chief of the Air Force have also articulated this high-low strategy. Their expectation to run an experimentation program here in the spring, and have articulated a requirement for about 300 aircraft.", "Again, as we've been articulating for some time, we believe internationally as well as even domestically, there is a market for an aircraft that is much more affordable, a lot fewer dollars per hour to operate. The 10, in fact, execute a lot of missions where we don't need to have the cost, and frankly, burn hours on the airframes of very highly utilized, very expensive aircraft.", "So again, this is an experiment program; it's certainly not a contract. Senator McCain's desire for a program like this and the budget line item that he's put in has to work its way into an actual budget. And these are numbers they're talking about for FY18 through FY22, but we knew this opportunity was coming. We expected that there was an opportunity here and we wanted to position ourselves to be able to be in a good place for that.", "So we spent a fair bit of money last year to make sure we're ready for that. We feel like we are ready for that, and we'll see how that program progresses.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Thanks, and then a quick one for you on the biz jet side. Scott, you made a comment earlier about how customers looking for low prices and you just don't want to go there. What's behind that desire or the low prices? Is it competition, or is it just core demand not being there, or maybe too much supply?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think it's a bit of both. I think if you looked in the Latitude space, clearly, the pricing in there has been very difficult. It has been improving, which we talked about in the past and it in continued to improve in the fourth quarter. And it's continued to improve in terms of orders that we've taken for deliveries into 2017, and we clearly expect that will continue to improve. But that's a price level that we're clearly not happy with from a profitability standpoint, so we'll keep working that.", "I think on the rest of the aircraft, it's - there's just not sufficient demand there yet. So I think in a lot of cases, we have people that are going to buy new aircraft. And they're looking for further incentive to do it now rather than do it sometime in the future. And it's just reached a price point where it doesn't make sense for us to build the aircraft, so that's the reason that we pulled back in the fourth quarter and anticipate pulling back through 2017.", "If the market changes and we see demand coming back, then obviously, we can react to that. And we're certainly hopeful that will be the case, but it needs to be at a price level that makes sense for us to sell the aircraft.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "I just wanted to start with the margin guidance in Aviation. It was flattish or slightly down progression in 2017, excluding Scorpion costs. Maybe if you could parse out which is the biggest anchor on the margins, if we think about pricing, which you've talked about, also then Longitude ramp-up costs. And also then, the lower production on the turboprop side. Which of those three, if you had to rank in order of import for the margins?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, that's a tough choice, Julian. The answer to the question is yes, right? And so, we're going to see Latitude volumes increase probably on the order of about 30%. That's good in terms of volume and it's good in terms of getting aircraft out there and operating, demand environment is good. It's a great aircraft, but it is dilutive to our margins, it's not priced where we want it to be. And as I said, we are making progress on trying to move that price up and we're going to continue to work hard on doing that as we go through 2017.", "So from a mix standpoint, that's a significant volume increase of something that is dilutive to our margin rate, and trying to overcome that is a bit of a headwind. On the other hand, a lot of these historical products on both the jet side, as well as the turboprop, including the defense side of the business, which were better margin, are either down in volume, AT6, for instance, is down significantly in volume. As we've finished the JPATS program, clearly, we have some international deliveries this year, but it's going to stabilize at a lower level. And then, when you look at the rest of our historical Citation products and King Air products and Caravans, these are at better margins and those volumes are going to be down.", "So, and again, I am not willing to take the prices down further to try to drive that demand and end up in a situation where we have today with the Latitude, where you have a great aircraft that delivers very, very well for customers but is priced at a point that doesn't make sense for us.", "So it really, Julian, it's a very simple mix change, right? We're seeing about a 30% increase so that Latitude becomes a significant portion of our sales at a diluted margin. And it's the so-called legacy aircraft that are going to be down in volume and they do have better margins.", "Julian Mitchell", "And then my second question is, maybe a little bit for Frank as well, but on the share buyback authorization announcement, should we read anything into that in terms of a change in approach by the Board and the management team regarding the appeal of buybacks in general? Some view on the stock's valuation? Or does it reflect maybe something about the scope for large M&A or the lack of opportunities for large M&A?", "Scott Donnelly", "Julian, we, as you know, over the last few years have been executing a buyback strategy that, again, remains committed to the offset of dilution. But also, we'll do things opportunistically when we think it makes sense. And as a result, we've retired a number of shares through that and we've been working our way through the previous authorization.", "I think the Board is fully on board with that capital allocation strategy, and the renewal and putting 25 million share authorization is so we can continue that strategy. So we'll continue to offset dilution, and as we see appropriate opportunities that makes sense from an overall value perspective to retire shares, we'll continue to do that. And this authorization just gives us the authority and place to continue on that strategy.", "Julian Mitchell", "And then just following up on that, so has there been any change in view on your part or the Board's part about the right level of financial leverage for Textron? Or that view is unchanged from one or two years ago?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think it's pretty consistent. We're pretty happy where the balance sheet is, and I think the leverage numbers we've talked about before continue to be our target.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "So your R&D looks like it's some $40 million to $50 million in 2016 lighter than - or something like that, lighter than you've projected going into the year. And you've projected another $87 million decline in 2017. Give us some color in terms of where was it down in 2016, and where do you expect it down in 2017?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So if you looked at 2015 to 2016, Cai, the principal reduction was at Bell. And unfortunately, a lot of that was associated in one way or the other with the 525 program. Obviously, as a result of the accident, we curtailed the flight test part of the program.", "The good news is, I think we're getting close. We have a team working very hard to try to get that aircraft back into the flight test program here in the early part of this year. But we, obviously, through suspension of that program, our costs, our funding was lighter than we would've originally expected in 2016.", "If you look at the walk from 2016 to 2017, the reduction is principally in the Aviation space. And when I say Aviation, I'm including a significant reduction in spending on Longitude. We spent a lot of money last year getting those first couple aircraft into the flight test program, and that was a big milestone to get that done. But there was a lot of money spent to do that.", "And parallel with that, obviously we were doing a lot of work on the Scorpion program to get into the certification program. And again, getting the first production aircraft flying into that flight test program. So there was a lot of - there's always a lot of money involved in getting an aircraft into the flight test program as you complete the engineering and all the preparation for flight tests and building out the aircraft.", "And so with both Longitude and the production version of Scorpion flying, we'll see reduced spending on both of those programs in 2017. It's somewhat offset by some increased spending on the Hemisphere program and the Denali program, but net, that's where the reduction is. So that's - you'll see that all - it's really all in the Aviation side in 2017.", "Cai von Rumohr", "And then speaking of the Longitude, you talked of deliveries ramping in 2018. I think at one point, you were indicating expected deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2017. When do you expect to make first deliveries?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I'm sorry, Cai, I didn't mean to change that. The wording's probably a little unclear. We're still expecting the first couple of deliveries of Longitude in the fourth quarter of 2018 - I'm sorry, 2017, but it's only a couple of aircraft. But that's been our plan all along. So it is still our plan that we would get FAA certification and make the first couple of deliveries late this year, and then you'd see a significant production ramp-up as we go into 2018.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Can I just, to just tie things up, the $57 million decline in corporate expense, is that all Scorpion moving into Aviation or is there anything else going on there?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, no, the bulk of that is the Scorpion program moving over to Aviation.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And then you talked, Scott, about the commercial helicopter business showing signs of bottoming in the third quarter and sounds like it's continued. Is there any way we can look at the aftermarket in this fourth quarter? Did you see any improvement there, since I would expect to see that turn first?", "Scott Donnelly", "Not really. It was a little bit better, Sam, but not appreciably.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And, what are you expecting in terms of commercial for 2017, and in some of the products like 412s and others on the commercial side?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we'll certainly see an increase in 412s. We've been pretty happy, as we talked about last quarter, and that continues in terms of some of the 412 orders closing, so our production looks pretty good right now. And then there's a couple more opportunities out there that I think will close here in the near future that will not only help us feel good about where we are in 2017, but also 2018 and beyond.", "So that's, I think, the 412 situation is significantly improved from where it was coming into 2016. 505 obviously is incremental; we're basically, probably selling just about as many as we can make, so we feel pretty good about where that is. The 429s are doing well. 407s are still a little soft, but again, hopefully with a little bit of the economic growth, that will shore up as well. So clearly, our expectation is that we'll have a better year on the commercial side in 2017 than we had in 2016.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "I had a couple questions on Bell. The first on this framework agreement with China for the 100 407s. First, when do you expect that to finalize? And in terms of financials, is it going to be like a royalty type of arrangement like with the 412s in Japan?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, no, I think there's been a fair bit of confusion over that agreement or some misreporting by some media things. So, just to be clear, this is a customer. So we are still in the process of negotiating with them, but this would be the acquisition of 100 aircraft.", "In essence, what they would do is take deliveries of these aircraft and then do local completion and finishing, depending on what application they're going to go into. So, for us this is - it's a-- we're obviously, were working with them to help them to have the capability to do what they need to do to finish and customize the aircraft in the Chinese market. But it's very much a customer relationship in terms of selling the aircraft.", "Pete Skibitski", "And then the other one, I think I heard you say, Scott, that you finalized the Pakistan contract for nine AH-1s. I'm just wondering when do you expect the next international sales to come on. The AH1, it seems like there's a decent amount of opportunities, see in Poland, Romania, and I think there's others out there. Just curious as to the timing.", "Scott Donnelly", "It is, it's just timing and, frankly, a couple of these customers were waiting for the administration change. And obviously, everybody is just getting into place and starting the process. So it's - I expect these to be normal FMS cases, so there's a little challenge around predicting when these things will go through. But there are, I'd say, a robust number of customers and volumes that are in discussion that are working LOAs, and it's going to happen. It's just everything was sitting on the side waiting for the administration to change, and these things now are going to move forward.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Scott, in the business jet market, given what you're describing with the price you're experiencing on your new product, and then also saying that you need to reduce production on the legacy product, I'm wondering if that has you concerned at all that the industry attempted to solve an oversupply problem with new versions of supply. Like, clearly, there was too much used inventory in the market and it, every player in the industry brought new product to stimulate demand rather than just reducing existing production to clear all that inventory.", "Is that a fair assessment? And if so, even if the post-election better economy hope actually happens, is there still a decent amount of inventory to clear before new sales are better?", "Scott Donnelly", "Noah, that's a good question. The dynamic has been complicated, obviously, and the role that used aircraft play has been significant. But I think if you look at the used aircraft market, for the most part, it has been moving nicely. We've been disappointed in some of the price levels in the used market, but I do think it had its own little supply/demand problem going on.", "And we're sitting here today and now into 2017, and that large number of aircraft that constituted that large number of used available for sale that were built largely between 2004 and 2008 are now getting to be older aircraft, right? So I think that the attractiveness or the alternative of some of those versus the new aircraft buy is going down and just as a function of time.", "Again, the used aircraft market is fairly vibrant. I think it's moving, and we hear brokers starting to actually be bullish about some of these going on. We certainly feel good about where it is, with the exception of old, very high time aircraft, and we've been hit by some of that with some of the, for instance, older 10s are challenged, But for the most part, the used market is in pretty good shape right now and things are moving.", "So again, I think a part of the dynamic of this is obviously economic growth would matter a lot, right? We've been sitting here for a whole bunch of years with almost no economic growth. We're all pretty optimistic about what could happen in a 3% to 4% GDP place. I think that will help our industry, as it will help everybody in the economy.", "And the other part of it, which is we are going to see a lot of these used aircraft. They are getting older; every year they get older, which is the good news. So look, I think on - in terms of the new model side, an awful lot of the investment that we've made, as have others, is the demand for larger cabins. So when you look at the market and you talk to our customers, their expectation has moved to these bigger cabins.", "So when you think about the investments that we've made in Latitude, what we're doing in Longitude, ultimately into Hemisphere, people want bigger cabins. So I don't think the right answer would have been to not invest in these new spaces and expect that the older aircraft with the smaller cabins would have held in there, particularly with competition moving to bigger cabins.", "Noah Poponak", "Did I hear you say Latitude up about 30% in units in 2017?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, that's right. It will be up probably about 30%, and then evenly split between incremental sales to NetJets and retail customers.", "Noah Poponak", "And could you quantify, even if not as precisely, the order of magnitude of the decline on the rest of the portfolio? In terms of Cessna.", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I don't think we want to get into unit by unit, but it's pretty well across all of the historical--", "Noah Poponak", "I don't mean unit by unit. I just mean like total not Latitude.", "Scott Donnelly", "In terms of unit volumes?", "Noah Poponak", "It sounds like you're saying you are cutting production in Cessna jets that are not Latitude. Is that correct?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, exactly. Look, it ends up being about the same number of units.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think if you looked at jet units on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be about flat. Over every incremental Latitude, you're taking out an aircraft that was either Sovereign or XLS or CJ4, CF3+ or M2, roughly.", "Noah Poponak", "Got it. And then just last one on the market, would full CapEx expensing in year one materially help your end market there? Or, does existing pretty substantial accelerated depreciation, is that already a pretty large input into demand in the business jet market?", "Scott Donnelly", "You already have bonus depreciations doing a 50-50, Noah, so I'm not sure it would make a huge difference. I think that, from my perspective anyway, I think what would provide a lot more stimulation to our customer base would be overall reductions in taxes, and a lot of reduced regulation and just creating a higher growth environment. I think that's a lot more impactful than the depreciation curve.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Just a couple quick ones. One is on the Scorpion expense of $50 million in 2017 and the decision to put it into one of the operating segments. So it is a twofold question. One is what's the trend line of program expenditures after 2017? And Scott, to put it into a business where the business is probably, obviously, got a lot of other priorities and is trying to get to the bottom line, is this the sink or swim decision for the Scorpion? So is it now on a clock, and also, what's your expectation for expenses beyond 2017? Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it is on a bit of a clock and not for any negative reasons. It's just when you get to a point where the things that you needed to be able to check off when customers talk to you about, hey we're interested but here's what we have to see, A, you've got to be able to tell us how you're going to get to certification. So we're now on that path.", "You need to show us that you could actually build these on a - what's the production conforming version of the aircraft? We now have that flying. And we had customers, including our US customers, saying, look, this is a weapons system; we want to see that it's capable of delivering munitions. And so we did that; we went to White Sands and we fired several different precision and non-precision weapons and had raving success in a pretty short period of time.", "So I think when you have conversations with customers, be it international or domestic, they said, here's the things we need to see to be able to really consider this platform. So we've done that now, so we don't have those impediments.", "So I think we are now on a reasonable time that says, guys, we either need to see these discussions move to some form of an order, something more concrete, or we need to spend more money on it. So I think 2016 was a huge year for us in terms of being able to say, okay, guys, now we've checked these things off; albeit, not until December, obviously, in terms of getting the first flight of the production aircraft going. So I think this is now the time to see, do these things move from discussion to something that's serious.", "Now, the move to put it into the business wasn't portending anything particular, right? Look, the expense is there, regardless of how we've accounted for it, but we've always had this in corporate because it was an experiment, right? And this was not something that was - had a clear linkage to a particular business to drive revenue and margin. But I think now as we get into a point that says, alright, this thing is now ready to fully be able to go to market, well that's the business' job, right? Corporate doesn't do that.", "And so I think now having this where the team in Aviation, particularly on our defense side, will pick up the marketing and drive this thing to achieve its milestones, get certifications done and try to bring this thing to fruition in terms of orders, it's appropriate that those expenses be in that segment where you would also then record revenue and margin.", "So it's a big change for where the program was which was in a very experimental phase up until now. To where now, we have these critical things out of the way, a clear path to a real marketable product, and therefore, it makes sense to be in business.", "Myles Walton", "And the $50 million step, or $50 million in 2017, is there a big step down no matter what in 2018 within Aviation?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think you're either going to be see a big step down or you're going to see a step up, because there's a real order and an opportunity that we need to go exit into.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Just a few follow-ups if that's okay. On the legacy aircraft, I think the tone has been it's rough, it's a challenging market, but it's flattish. And it seems like it changed in Q4 and that's driving some of the production cuts. Can you talk about that a bit? Why the tone changed in the last quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look, Sheila, I think that we were seeing some incremental pricing, we were feeling good about stabilization. And it seemed like when we got to the fourth quarter, we had a number of transactions where people just wanted to go to even lower prices, and we said that we're just not - we can't do that. We can't make it unhealthy for the business.", "So again, as I said earlier, I think that's where we see it at this point, and that led us to back off on some of these production volumes because we're just not going to create capacity out there if it's not a market that's willing to at least pay a fair price for the aircraft. We're certainly hopeful that will change. And if we see that dynamic change, we can obviously react very quickly to try to get additional aircraft into the market.", "But we were seeing, as we went through the year, what we thought was a reasonable progression of feeling like the pricing was firming up. And it seemed like in the fourth quarter, given the number of aircraft that were out there, the demand just didn't match up and it wanted to see a lower price point. And, as I said, we're just, we're not going there.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Understood. That makes sense. Another one on Aviation margins. I understand that the Latitude is dilutive and that might be half due to the NetJets deliveries and the competition with the legacies. And just how do you think about the market as we - the market for the Longitude, just given that there's no competitor out there, or new model out there for that aircraft. And how - if that's dilutive or not as we start production deliveries in 2017 and into 2018?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. Well, look, Sheila, obviously, the situation with Latitude, we're not happy with where that is, right? We feel like we delivered a great aircraft to the marketplace, customers loved the aircraft, it's performing well, there's just - the thing is a home run. But we're not enjoying the benefit of that because it's in there at a price point that we're not happy with, and that was obviously a competitive dynamic that caused that to happen.", "Where we're positioning the Longitude, we're not going to let that happen. I think when you look at what's out there competing with it, we have superior performance, and we're going to start holding the price line from day one that has to make that an attractive aircraft for us, as well as for our customers. And so far, the discussions we're having with customers.", "And look, we are taking deposits on the aircraft. Obviously, we're not through certification testing and all that, so we're not going to see - you're not going to see a big impact on backlog yet. But I think the product is being very well received by customers. There's a pretty strong interest, but it's at a price level that's a fair price. And so I think we just have to make sure that in the future, our new models are good for us and our customer.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Understood, and then just last one on Bell. What's the sequential pickup in the backlog? And then can we talk about the moving pieces within Bell profitability? I know there are a lot of moving pieces, but it seems 412 is the only one that really matters. Just looking at the second half, 2016 margins, they were pretty good, so if you could talk about that a bit.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, so Bell backlog is up. Part of that, of course, is that we put the multi-year volumes in on a year-by-year basis, and we always do that in the fourth quarter when it gets appropriate. So part of that is the military side, which is our normal cycle. But we also had some positive backlog build on the commercial side.", "And again, as we talked about the Q3 and Q4, we did see nice increases in order activity on the commercial side. So they both contributed to the increase in backlog.", "There's no question when you look at the mix in the business certainly matters on the commercial side. And 2016, we did have some 412 sales here in the end of the quarter. H-1s - I'm sorry, Huey IIs do well and we had some Huey II volumes in the year as well.", "Again, as we look into 2017, we expect we'll be down a little bit on the B-22's which has been consistent with the plan. I think we'll do fine on the H-1s, and we'll see a little bit of an uptick on the commercial side in a number of the models. But the one that's most important from a profitability standpoint is the 412s.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Peter Arment", "Scott, just a quick one. You've had a ton of questions on Latitude, so I will just ask one. Back in, at MBAA, the increases that we were thinking about for 2017 was 15% to 20%, so obviously, it's doing great in the marketplace. Is this just mainly what we're seeing demand from North America, or are you seeing some other pockets that you're picking up strength, just from a geography standpoint?", "Scott Donnelly", "We're starting to pick up some international orders on Latitude, but it's still very much a US story at this point, I would say.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.", "Robert Stallard", "Just a couple of quick ones, Scott. First of all, on these customers that wanted the lower prices and you weren't prepared to give them in Aviation, do you know if they went to other manufacturers or are they still in the market?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think they're still in the market. And again, part of this is these are customers, a lot of these folks are guys who our customers today, they operate our aircraft today and they're very happy with our aircraft. And I think, ultimately, they're going to stay in our aircraft.", "But if they're not ready, if they're happy with their current aircraft and they're willing to wait and run that aircraft for another year or two, then that's fine. We just don't need to take pricing to a level that doesn't make sense in order to try to make that happen now, and that's why we feel like adjusting this demand by taking the production down is fine. If the market's not --if it's fewer aircraft, then we're going to build fewer aircraft in that space and not do that.", "Now, some are competitive, and obviously, and we walk away from some deals. But I think we need to do that to create some price integrity in the marketplace. It just doesn't make sense to get it to where it - it doesn't make sense to sell aircraft at that low price.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay. And then, secondly, on Kautex, is there any implications from this tax legislation that's being discussed in DC?", "Scott Donnelly", "I'm sorry, I'm not, there's a lot of tax discussion, Robert. Is there something more particular, because I don't know of anything that would directly affect Kautex.", "Robert Stallard", "Yes, in terms of the context of their based overseas and linked to the automotive industry.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, Kautex manufactures and ships and sells in those markets. So we go where our customers are building automobiles. And so, it's - we wouldn't expect a material impact. Now obviously, if you begin to see auto production shift, we'll follow that auto production accordingly, but we don't expect a big impact.", "Operator", "And no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to our speakers.", "Eric Salander", "Okay, thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "That does conclude the conference for today. This conference will be made available for replay after 10 o'clock this morning and running through Tuesday, April 18th at midnight.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Joining us today are Mr. Lewis Campbell, Chairman, President and CEO and Mr. Ted French, CFO, and Mr. Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Now, I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Lauri and good morning everyone. Before we begin, I would like to mention our discussion today will include remarks about future estimates and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our annual SEC filings and also in today's press release. A calculation of 2008 ROIC, which we will be discussing today, is also attached to our press release and available on the website in the IR section. Finally, also you can find a slide deck on our website containing key data items that we are going to discuss on today's call.", "Finally, now moving to our results for the fourth quarter, revenues were $3.8 billion, up 18% from last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.02, up 32% from $0.77 a year ago, and compared to our expectation of $0.82 to $0.92. Our EPS performance reflected good delivery execution at Cessna and Bell, which allowed for early delivery of seven jets and five helicopters, generating a $0.07 EPS benefit in the quarter. We also had an unanticipated Canadian tax benefit at TFC, which was worth about $0.02 per share, partially offset by a $0.01 of dilution related to our acquisition of AAI and Columbia Aircraft, all of which were not included in our guidance. On the cash front, full-year cash flow provided by continuing operations was $1.2 billion with free cash flow of $796 million.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Lewis.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Doug Good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter culminated a year of powerful performance at Textron on many fronts. Full-year revenues were up 15%, about 13% organically by the way. EPS from continuing ops was up 32%. Free cash flow was up 15%. And I think more importantly, each of our manufacturing segments showed year-over-year operating improvement resulting in a 160 basis point increase in overall manufacturing margins. And finally, return on invested capital improved 800 basis points reaching 24.8% in 2007.", "Now, last year's solid results are evidence of the continuing progress we are making in our journey to become the premier multi-industry company. We fortified and expanded our future growth potential through many transformational actions taken last year, basically in the following four categories, operational improvement, capital investment, strategic acquisitions, and new product developments. Let me say more, we continue to attack operational improvement primarily through the deployment, penetration, and maturation of Textron Six Sigma into the processes by which we manage and improve our businesses. Last year, we certified an additional 153 black belts and 1,429 green belts, which now brings our totals to 890 black belts and 4,200 green belts. Because leadership is so vital in a cultural initiative like this, we've mandated that every member of our global leadership team, which comprises the top 180 leaders from around the world, attain a green belt certification. Continuous systematic business improvement and operational execution are becoming the number one cultural identifier of Textron.", "Happily as we look at our end-market opportunities over the next five years, we see tremendous growth potential and we are committing the necessary capital to service this demand. Let me give you some examples. At Bell, we are investing for an unprecedented expansion of output and we've made a significant amount of progress with the leadership and organization capabilities there. The ongoing processes improvements across operations have begun to show the expected results with record gearbox production supporting continued V-22 production ramp-up. These improvements support our plan to increase V-22 deliveries to 17 ships this year, up from 14 in 2007, and we are well on our way to produce 36 ships in 2011, a tremendous expansion of output, given the capacity requirements of each V-22. The program is doing very well on all fronts. Most importantly, the Warfighter, the Marine Corp. aircraft, are demonstrating excellent operating performance as they fly the full range of [inaudible] missions in Iraq.", "We also made continuous progress with our H-1 program last year, delivering the first ten production units. However, with the conversion from remanufactured aircraft all to new, an important next step, we have encountered some cost and delivery issues for the new cabins from our supplier, we are still negotiating with the customer and our supplier, but we recorded a charge at Bell in the quarter to cover anticipated cost. In the mean time, the H-1 [inaudible] surely and we anticipate a successful outcome, and therefore we are optimistic that we will have a full rate production decision by year one on the H-1.", "Moving to ARH. We are currently working under an expanded development contract and we made tremendous progress on this program with our customer over the past nine months. Our revised initial production plan has been developed and we expect the signed agreement around mid-year. Based on this new understanding, during the quarter, we reduced the ARH reserve, which we had established earlier this year. Moving to commercial at Bell. Here we made excellent progress with capacity expansion and execution, as we delivered 181 units during the year, up 14% from 2006, which in turn was up 29% from 2005. To concentrate output on deliveries of our high demand aircraft, we made a decision in the fourth quarter to streamline our legacy commercial offerings and recorded a related charge.", "Moving to Systems. We delivered 576 ASVs for the year and that's up 21% from 2006. We expect 15% growth in armored vehicle revenues in 2008 due to significant growth in after-market services, upgrade requirements for existing units, and early foreign military demands. We recently received a contract from the army that covers the US production funding at the current delivery schedule of 48 per month through May of 2009, with anticipated supplements providing funding through the balance of '09. We are working with the DoD for out-year funding to bridge to military vehicles... the military's vehicle requirements until the new joint and light tabular vehicle production begins sometime next decade.", "Investing in capacity at Cessna also paid off this year, as we delivered 387 jets, a new record and up 26% from '06. We have additional CapEx requirements at Cessna over the next several years to accommodate ever-increasing output and new models. We also invested in a number of strategic acquisitions last year, each of which strengthened existing businesses and will contribute to future growth. For example, at Greenlee, we expanded our product offerings with the acquisition of Paladin Tools, a telecom test gear manufacturer. We added to Bell Helicopter\u2019s support and service capabilities with addition of Cabair, a helicopter maintenance and service center located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and most recently, McTurbine, a provider of helicopter engine maintenance and repair services, which came as part of the AAI acquisition. And just last week, we brought in SkyBOOKS to provide helicopter operators with advanced electronic maintenance and operating log capabilities.", "At Cessna, as you know, we acquired Columbia Aircraft, an innovative high-performance propeller aircraft manufacturer. This acquisition accelerates our critical product extension strategy in this class of aircraft. And our addition of AAI to the precision engagement capability at Systems, significantly augments our ability to compete and win as a prime contractor for this important military strategy going forward. By the way, we are well into the AAI integration process, we're using Textron Six Sigma tools to ensure that the additional yields and synergies that we expect, both in the amount and timing, will be possible just as we expected when we bought into the combination.", "Finally, we are also making considerable investments in innovation and new product developments across our businesses. You know, we increased R&D spending by 11% last year, bringing many new products to market and we are planning another 24% increase this year. We launched our new professional hand tool line in the beginning of the year at Greenlee, and the introduction has been a resounding success.", "At Caltex, we played an integral role in developing a selective catalytic reduction system, an innovative OEM product, which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions to meet the most stringent environmental regulations. And in today's environmentally alert marketplace, we've just introduced the world's most energy-efficient golf car with many exciting new features that will be attractive to golf course operators and golfers alike.", "If the value of investing in new products needed any validation, our ending aircraft backlog of $16.4 billion, up 41% from a year ago should be convincing. On top of that, at Systems, we have a $2.4 billion backlog, plus we have $1 billions worth of Bell 429 customer purchase agreements not yet in backlog. So, if you add all that together, we have nearly $20 billion in existing customer orders at Cessna, Bell, and Systems.", "We expect the 429 will enter into the backlog after first production flight, expected around mid-year. We are targeting our first 429 delivery by the end of the year or early 2009, and have a production ramp plan that goes to 60 units annually by 2011.", "Demand for commercial helicopters remain strong as we booked 268 orders in '07, significantly higher than last year's deliveries of 181. And global demand for business yet also remains unprecedented. Cessna added another 164 orders in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to 773 orders taken in 2007, an all-time record and up from 496 orders in 2006.", "Clearly, there are two major factors driving business jet orders. First, there's a global expansion of demand and the second is new models like our Sovereign, the CJ4, and the Mustang. Importantly, as I said before, the Mustang being a lower price point offering has opened an entirely new universe of potential jet orders. And while Mustang customers are adding to demand today, the even better news is many of these orders will eventually choose to upgrade to a larger citation driving future demand as well.", "And by the way, our launch of Mustang has been as near to perfect as any launch we've ever undertaken at Cessna. When we introduced the Mustang at the 2002 NBAA show, we said we would fully certify and begin deliveries in 2006, and further we would ramp to 150 units of production in 2009. We're doing exactly that and the market demand has materialized just as we expected it would. Which brings us to our final topic at Cessna and that is our announcement this morning that we're moving forward with our much-anticipated large cabin, intercontinental Citation jet.", "We believe this strategic step strengthens our position as the premier global business jet manufacturer. We're confident, we'll bring this aircraft to market on time, on budget, and on performance. More importantly, we've stayed in the marketplace, including current and potential competitive offerings and believe there will be significant demand for this new model well into the future. In fact, we've received a large number of advanced customer requests to be placed in the production queue. Each of these requests was accompanied by a $100,000 refundable deposit.", "With the official announcement, we'll be converting these indications of interest into binding contracts with non-refundable initial deposits of $1 million each. And we expect to have at least 70 firm orders for the LCC by the end of this year. In fact, we're expecting another banner year of new orders at Cessna all around. Based on our current customer activity, our marketing plans and assessment of the marketplace, we expect to book over 570 total jet orders this year, well above our delivery forecast of 470.", "Given that our delivery schedule is completely booked out well into 2009 and supported by the diversification of our order book, we expect continued uninterrupted growth of Cessna well into the next decade.", "Now, I'm sure there are many questions about the LCC at this point, I'm sure we can spend the rest of the call on that subject, but we need to maximize the marketing impact of our launch and we'll not be discussing further details about the new model until our press conference on February 6. The only exception is that Ted in just a few minutes will discuss how the LCC is expected to affect our financial results in 2008, which is obviously already fully reflected in our outlook.", "Now, let me change subjects for a minute. I want to make a few comments about our expected performance in the context of the current economic situation. We now know that US corporate profits contracted in the third quarter of 2007, primarily driven by the financial sector and economists expect continued softness through at least the first half of 2008. Obviously, this news and the likely fact that we're already in the US economic downturn, are weighing heavily on the stock market. But, I've to say that we're puzzled at Textron [inaudible] our shares have fallen compared to our peers in the market overall. We believe that a significant amount of our enterprise is relatively unaffected by the economy and that we're well positioned for this environment. First, only a small portion of Bell Helicopter and Textron Systems is driven by the economy. So, we expect growth at these businesses units will remain relatively uninterrupted.", "At Cessna, we've analyzed the 2001, 2002, 2003 that period\u2026 that jet downturn, which was the worst down cycle we've ever experienced, and we carefully modeled our next three years deliveries on the basis of annual percentage cancellations and percent reductions in new orders during that prior period to really understand specifically how a similar downturn could affect our 2008 to 2010 delivery outlook.", "Even subjected to the severe 2003 scenario, our delivery outlook for 2008 and 2009 remains unaffected and we would expect 2010 to be no worse than flat with 2009. Now, this is simply a function of the unprecedented backlog, which currently stands at 1,418 units in comparison to 811 units at the end of 2000. Yet, keep in mind we do not believe the extreme 2003 scenario will repeat in terms of cancellation rates or order intake because both our backlog and orders have been better diversified by customers, specifically we have less dependence on fractional and by market with a significantly higher international mix. Furthermore, the 2003 downturn was also magnified by the 9/11 disruption, that among other things, halted business jet travel in 2001, placing unique uncertainty into the marketplace.", "So, in summary, we continue to have confidence in our increasing deliveries in 2008, 2009 and 2010 even given the current economic uncertainty. As for Industrial, the biggest driver there is Kautex and the current downturn in US automobiles and slower global demand are already built into our outlook.", "Finally at TFC, we\u2019re not involved in sub prime or other misunderstood or high-risk products and we expect our portfolio of credit performance to remain within normal historic ranges in the softer economic environment.", "In conclusion, we see another solid year and continued growth at Textron in 2008 and beyond. In fact, we see 8% to 12% annual revenue growth through the planning horizon. And reinforced by our transformation strategy, we believe that we will be able to convert this growth into expanding shareholder value for years to come.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Ted. Ted?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you Lewis, and good morning everyone. I want to start by reinforcing Lewis' optimism for growth. Obviously the US economy is now weaker and it is certainly more uncertain. However, we have good revenue visibility based on our solid growing backlogs, plus we continue to observe positive forward signals in the business jet marketplace.", "So, let me start by looking at an analysis of our fourth quarter results. Quarterly revenues increased 18%, while EPS from continuing ops was up 32%, representing another excellent conversion. Earnings per share were up $0.25 from a year ago. Volume and mix provided $0.14. Higher pricing of about 3.3% added $0.30 a share. And inflation of 3.2% cost us about $0.22. Performance was a positive $0.24. The combined headwinds of engineering, research and development, depreciation, and pension expense collectively cost $0.13, and miscellaneous items, including higher corporate expenses partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and a lower share count cost $0.04. Taxes cost $0.03, and Textron Financial was lower by $0.01.", "Now, let's review each of our business segments, and I will start with Cessna. Cessna's revenues and profits increased $329 million and $75 million respectively in the fourth quarter. Revenues increased due to higher volume, primarily related to Citation business jets and higher pricing. Profit increased due to the higher pricing along with the impact of higher volume and favorable warranty performance, partially offset by inflation and increased product development expense. Continued strength in orders gives us conviction in our outlook as we now have another record Cessna backlog at $12.6 billion, that's up $4.1 billion or 48% from a year-ago.", "Moving to Bell. Segment revenues increased $120 million for the quarter, while profit was up $36 million. Profit in the quarter was affected by the following three items, which Lewis referenced earlier. $30 million in charges for the H-1 program, $16 million of costs for product rationalization in our commercial business, and a $27 million profit benefit related to the ARH program, reflecting a reduction in the ARH reserve of about a third and recovery of some previously un-reimbursed development costs.", "Fourth quarter US Government revenues were up $81 million due to the addition of acquisition revenues and higher volume. The volume increase reflects higher H-1 and sensor fuzed weapon quantities, partially offset by lower ASVs, Helicopter after-market services, and V-22 deliveries. Profits in our US Government business were up $41 million due to favorable performance partially offset by inflation. The favorable performance primarily reflects lower H-1 charges year-over-year and the benefits recorded in the quarter for the ARH program. The favorable performance was partially offset by last year's reimbursement of cost related to Hurricane Katrina.", "Commercial revenues were up $39 million, while profits were down $5 million. Commercial revenues increased due to higher pricing and the benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by lower volume. Commercial profit decreased primarily due to the product rationalization cost, some inflation, and higher engineering, research and development expenses, and lower volume, partially offset by higher pricing.", "Bell Helicopters backlog was $3.8 billion at the end of the year, that's up 23% from $3.1 billion at the end of '06, benefiting from growth in both military and commercial orders. Textron Systems backlog was $2.4 billion, up from $1.3 billion last year reflecting both the acquisition of AAI and growth in orders.", "Now for Industrial. Revenues and profits increased $113 million and $21 million respectively. The revenue increase came from higher volume and favorable foreign exchange and higher pricing. Profits increased due to positive cost performance, higher pricing, and the impact of volume and mix, partially offset by inflation.", "Lastly, Finance revenues were flat with last years fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in securitization and other fee income, offset by a reduction in finance charges due the lower interest rate environment. Segment profit was lower by $4 million, as loss provisions went up, while net interest margin was down. The net interest margin decline was attributable to an increase in borrowings spreads, partially offset by the increase in securitization and other fee income.", "Portfolio quality continues to be absolutely excellent with a 60 day delinquency rate of 0.43%, non-performing assets of 1.34%, and net charge-offs of 45 basis points. For the year then, Textron Financial had record revenues and profits, while maintaining excellent credit quality. Looking to 2008, we expect continued strong credit quality based on the product lines we are in, the creditworthiness of our customers, and the structures of our loans. ITFC '08 profit outlook reflects some conservatism, primarily related to the recent narrowing of spreads between the prime rate upon which the majority of our customers\u2019 loans are indexed and LIBOR upon which most our borrowing costs are indexed.", "Actually tough, over the last week or so, the spread has begun to return to more normal levels, but our guidance reflects narrower margins nonetheless based on an assumption that this anomaly persist at some level through most of the year.", "One final comment on fourth quarter results is that the tax rate was lower than we forecasted due to the Canadian tax benefit at TFC. In addition, the rate was lower due to higher compensation hedge income, which is not taxable, and results in a lower reported tax rate, but it's fully offset up in corporate spending, so it has no impact on earnings per share.", "Now for our '08 outlook. For the full year, we are forecasting earnings in a range of $3.75 to $3.95, and for the first quarter we are targeting EPS between $0.75 and $0.85. These amounts fully reflect the 24% increase in ER&D that Lewis mentioned, which equates to $108 million or about $0.29 a share. Cessna accounts for $0.17 of the increase, of which $0.09 is attributable to the LCC program. It also reflects $0.09 in dilution from the AAI acquisition and $0.06 in dilution from the Columbia acquisition as we invest to strengthen and grow this business. And finally our investments in new capacity will result in higher depreciation expense worth about $0.14 a share. Collectively these items represent about $0.58 in earnings headwinds. While these investments reduce the '08 earnings growth that we otherwise would have seen, we believe that each will contribute to future revenue growth and increase shareholder value.", "We are forecasting cash flow provided by continuing ops to come in at about $1.3 billion. With the need for additional investments and capacity, our capital program next year now looks to be about $550 million, which should result in free cash flow coming in somewhere between $700 million and $750 million.", "In closing, our outlook at Textron remains very positive. We are expecting strong growth again this year through the rest of this decade and beyond. We have a large military backlog and our products are critical to our armed forces. We also have a large aircraft backlog and it would take a major extended global downturn to interrupt the growth in deliveries that our customers have ordered and continue to order. We believe the real growth opportunities that lie before us, coupled with our ever improving ability to execute, will translate into increased shareholder value this year and for years to come.", "Now, I would like to... I ask Doug to come back on and provide some additional '08 data.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ted and we'll begin with full year. For 2008, we expect Bell segment revenues will be up about 20%, with margins up about 30 basis points at about 8.9%. The higher revenues reflect the full-year impact and growth at AAI. Revenues also reflect delivery of about 17 V-22s, 10 H-1s, and about 580 ASVs. We are targeting 160 commercial deliveries as we concentrate this year's capacity expansion on pre-assembly production for the large military ramp-up targets in 2010 and beyond.", "At Cessna, we're expecting revenues to be $5.9 billion, with margins of about 16.5%, reflecting LCC and Columbia Aircraft development costs. Industrial revenue is expected to be approximately flat at $3.4 billion, with margins of about 6%. Finance revenues are projected to come in at about $885 million, with segment profit flat with '07, reflecting lower interest margins, higher loss provisions, and slightly slower portfolio growth.", "At the corporate level, we are assuming share buybacks of 3 million to 4 million of shares to maintain a flat share account for which we're already ahead of schedule by the way given our recent share price performance. By the way, last year we repurchased 5.9 million shares at a cost of $295 million. We are expecting interest expense of about $141 million, reflecting higher debt levels as a result of last year's acquisitions. Corporate expenses will be about $243 million and we anticipate an \u201808 tax rate of about 32%. The tax rate presents an additional headwind of about $0.06 and it basically reflects the absence of a number of unique tax benefits in 2007, as well as higher '08 income. The additional income results in higher tax rate due to fixed tax credit items, which do not scale up.", "Let's move to the first quarter now. We expect Bell segment revenues will be about $1.1 billion, with margins of about 8%. First quarter revenues at Cessna should be about $1.35 billion, margins of about 16.25%, reflecting delivery of about 104 jets. Industrial segment revenue is expected to be about $850 million, with a margin expectation of about 5.5%. Finally, Finance revenues should be about $205 million, with profit between $50 million and $55 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. And before we go to questions, we would like to ask that each of you limit yourselves to one question with an optional follow-up to be fair. So, Laurie with that we are now ready to open the lines please.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question from the line of Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Nicole.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "I guess first, Lewis, your bullish outlook for Cessna is appreciated, could you give us a sense when you scrub the last recession? You have international demand that's un-presidented, could you give us a sense of how you assess the quality of that backlog and have you seen any cancellations at all or any kind of customer concerns about what is going on in the marketplace?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Nicole, I want to give you a really full answer on this one because we've really looked hard at this topic because we knew what we wanted to say on the call this morning, but we want to make darn sure and we have really scrubbed this data. So, let me give you some facts. Used aircraft, which is a pretty good precursor when it starts to go up but things are going to slow down some, still remains at low 10%, keep in mind, the late model aircraft, five years and younger, are just hard to get in the used aircraft market. So, a lot of those aircraft are quietly sitting there for the rest of their lives. We have not seen any observable deterioration in customer orders, we have very low\u2026 actually, I'd say almost unusually low cancellation versus normal years. So, that's not there. Net jet orders, which need to be understood in the context of where they are being sold and why, net jet orders and CitationShares are still very good. Net jet US orders primarily are for replacements, so that will continue and then they've really grown strong in Europe and really picking up steam there. I've mentioned order cancellations and then Jack and his team recently had a sales meeting kickoff in the west and the sales force is really bullish on what they see and the customers they have contacted. Another interesting fact, which I find to be kind of cool is, that back in 2000, before we saw 9/11 and the downturn that ended up being just awful through 2003, our backlog for the next three years is now 82% higher than what the backlog was we had for the three-year period. So, the three-year period '01, '02, '03, we had 693 jets on order for delivery. And for '07, '08, '09, we've 1,260 on order. So, [inaudible] look and you mentioned international versus domestic that's also a strong point. So, I would tell you if there is something coming at us, we can see it, and if it comes at us as hard as it did in '01, '02, '03, we firmly believe that we'll be able to meet the numbers that we talked about in the call here.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And one other follow-up for Ted. In the charts that you gave us to walk-through from '07 to '08, you said $0.34 of headwind, I think Doug referenced $0.06 of tax and you had $0.14 of capacity. Can you just talk a little bit about what the remaining variables are and how you might be able to offset them?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me see if I can find that here quickly. The headwind that\u2019s on the chart is only depreciation and R&D, and so those other pieces are additional\u2026", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Pension is actually not a headwind, it's about $0.04 of favorable tailwind this year.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "But, that\u2019s half of what we thought it would be when we talked to you back in February at the Analyst Day.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's true. Did not come in as strongly as we thought, but it's still $0.04 favorable nonetheless.", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, it's all either.... just $0.14 of depreciation, the balance is R&D.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Cai.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Great quarter. Great quarter. While you gave us kind of the EPS impact of both LCC and Colombia, could you give us kind of... because they're both at Cessna and what we really kind of maybe want to look at is the total [inaudible] of R&D and kind of approximately what was it in 2007 and what do you expect it to be in 2008 for Cessna and kind of going forward what should we, kind of, expect for the R&D now that LCC is launched?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President Investor Relations", "I got it right here. Let me make sure I understand, you wanted a total R&D change at Cessna?", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Well, the total R&D at Cessna, '07 and '08, so we can kind of see\u2026 there are other things coming off because we know LCC and Colombia are moving up.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President Investor Relations", "Yes, now there is other additions. Total Cessna R&D goes from a little over $270 million to $340 million. So, it's up about $68 million year-over-year. LCC is $53 million of the $68 million.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And just a general sense going forward now that you have kind of committed to LCC, how much is it in absolute terms this year and kind of what's about the profile going to be over the next couple of years? So, we know\u2026 give us some kind of sense as to what this is going to\u2026 might do.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In absolute terms, it's $53 million. It was $20 million last year, it's $53 million in '08. In '09\u2026 I've got it somewhere here but, can't put my finger on it. It goes higher in '09. We know that. It peaks at about $120 million in 2010.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company", "Excellent. Thank you very much.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Good morning guys.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Can you just give a little more flavor, you mentioned the positive indicators and expecting 570 orders, can you give us a little flavor on what are the components that go behind that?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I can tell you some basic stuff. Of the 570, we got 70 LCC, and...", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "500 plus 70.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, it\u2019s 500 plus 70. I don't think\u2026 you might never hear us say this again, but I don't think we have ever given out that number before. So, whether it\u2019s conservative or optimistic, you\u2019ll have to think for yourself on that subject, but we normally end up at least meeting it not beating in any return out. We have a good mix of international customers, that's good, well over 50% of deliveries. We are not heavily depended on the fractional... is that number 15% approx?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, that's fairly low. We have some other things on the horizon, and if they come true, we'll look really good. We really are having trouble meeting demand on some of our products over in Europe, because Europe has really heaten up and so we are wrestling with how we can move production around to be able to deliver a few more products here and there. So, it's just a really good balance of mix, there is nothing unusual in that book.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "I think what's really misunderstood is the depth and strength of the backlog. We've taken this backlog and torn it apart and we've modeled a scenario where order intake rates fall as... and remember we've looked at every downturn in general aviation since the Second World War and this downturn post 9/11 is by fall the worst of all of those. So, we've taken this existing backlog and we've gone back and modeled the rate of order fall-off from that we saw in the 2001, 2002, 2003 frame, and it\u2019s pretty radical by the way. Orders fell 68% in the first year, so down two-thirds, came back to being down about a third in the second year and got back to about even by the third year. So, we've modeled that in. We've modeled the rate of cancellations, which in that last downturn were 160 some out over three years. But, because our backlog is larger, we've modeled a number twice that big into it. And when you take that and take our production plans for 2008, 2009, and 2010, which grow every year, by the way, if that same event happens to us over that three-year period of time, we'll still end up with 20 months of backlog by the end of 2010. So, it's just very, very deep and I don't think that's well understood.", "Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And just on the margin on Cessna, I know you have Columbia and the incremental LCC in there, still very strong margin in the quarter, 18.4%, other than maybe slightly higher Mustang mix or anything else you are anticipating in 2008 for Cessna that we should know about in terms of a margin headwind?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Just two things to put it into context. The LCC reduces Cessna's \u201808 margin by 90 basis points and Columbia reduces the margins by 70 basis points, which might be a little surprising to you, but we are adding almost a $100 million worth of revenue with Columbia and we actually will have mid-20s kind of expense next year because while we bought a business, we are also really buying and developing a product line. So, we are investing in '08 and '09 in Columbia in order to get that product offering where we want it to be, the cost structure where we want it to be, the production capability where we want it to be. So, that will be about two years of investment. So, those two things are worth about 160 basis points. So, Cessna's '08 margins would be well up in the north of 18% range, but for those two items.", "Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay. [inaudible]. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question from the line of Rob Stallard with Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "Rob Stallard - Banc of America", "Good morning.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Rob.", "Rob Stallard - Banc of America", "Lewis, you gave a very strong view on the strength of\u2026 with the US economy being what it is. But, I was perhaps a little bit surprised by your confidence on industrial revenues heading into 2008 that they can stay flat; you mentioned the Kautex is tied to the automotive world. Can you give us a little bit more flavor of how you come to that forecast of flat revenues in '08?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "For industrial?", "Rob Stallard - Banc of America", "Yes.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We understand the automotive market and we know which models we are on. So, it makes it a little bit easier for us to estimate the Kautex numbers because it's not just auto industry\u2026 it is. But it's not jus that, if you are on the wrong model even in an up year, you could be having down revenues yourselves. So, I'd say Kautex is probably pretty dug and well understood. Non-res construction so far is still supporting the Greenlee numbers, although that's not a huge contributor to our overall revenue forecast, but they are a contributor. You've got fluid and power with oil and gas very strong. We did a big field reduction of inventory at Jacobsen, so that really helps us going into '08. So, we are not trying\u2026 we don't have to bleed the field down. The new golf car, E-Z-GO should sell well in the market, and we don't really have a strong new golf course opening number out there in '08. So, we feel pretty good about that. What do I miss there?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "We think we reflect the environment we are seeing.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's hard to predict what the US economy is going to do and we try to do the best we could and kind of take it as a negative approach in industrial to make sure we didn't overstate ourselves.", "Rob Stallard - Banc of America", "Ted, you mentioned that charge-offs in Finance have been very good. Your forecast for '08, does that imply a more historical charge-off rate?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We had an abnormally low rate, very, very strong performance in 2007. So, we are expecting it to tick up a little bit in '08, but still be at a very good level. The real drivers around the finance business are that we are seeing a little bit slower growth rates in a number of our businesses, primarily in distribution and finance, which have been our fastest growing business, but has a lot of consumer durables. So, we are actually seeing some declines in manufactured housing in marine, growth, but little bit slower in most of the rest of businesses. So, it is still growing overall, but a little bit slower. The main impact on us has been this indices mismatch between prime and labor. It hasn't been credit losses, growth is a little bit slower, but we're still getting growth. It's really been this margin compression issue that cost us about $2.5 million in the third quarter, cost us $7.5 million last quarter... in the fourth quarter. It is going to cost us about $3 million in the first quarter and then we have about $1.5 million bad news baked into the plan for the balance of the year, quarter-by-quarter which things not gone\u2026 would stay like they did here in the last two or three days, it could be a little bit of upside to us. So, we've got a fairly conservative forecast out there based on what these rates were looking like when we put this plan together, and as of the last week, they are looking very positive again, but that's fooled us a little bit in the early fourth quarter well, so we will hold on and see what happens.", "Rob Stallard - Banc of America", "That\u2019s great. Thanks Ted.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Just one other detail on that Rob, by the way. Lewis mentioning Greenlee and strong growth we've had in the past, we've had three years in a row of double-digit growth at Greenlee, and when we put our outlook together for next year, we dropped it down into a low-single digit, just to give you an idea of kind of granularity that we are looking at there. So, a flat year at industrial is certainly in the cards unless things get considerably worse than where we are now.", "Rob Stallard - Banc of America", "Yes, great.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question from the line of David Bleustein with UBS. Please go ahead.", "David Bleustein - UBS", "Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, David.", "David Bleustein - UBS", "Quick question. Of the 500, Lewis you mentioned, a bunch coming from international, is that similar to your shipment mix?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it is. Right, our delivery mix is about the same as order mix, correct.", "David Bleustein - UBS", "Okay. [inaudible] for '08?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it's been climbing up. It has gone from, international was 30% back probably at the start of the decade, now it's well over 50%, in fact, the order intake I think is forecasted to be about 60%.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "We did a little over 50% international both order and delivery this year and we think the order intake will be about 60% international for '08.", "David Bleustein - UBS", "Okay. What years are these planes being booked for and are there any deliveries left at all for '08 and what does '09 look like?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "There is nothing left for '08, there are a few models that are available in the last half of '09. So, most of what we are selling\u2026 actually, most of those that are available in '09 are already spoken for, they are just not technically signed up. They've got customers names on them. So, we are really booking 2010 right now. Basically, all products other than new models like the CJ4 are available in 2010.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right now in '09, the only two models available are [inaudible] CJ1+ and the Encore+, and as Ted said, they are really spoken for, for the most part with an order under negotiation, and with respect to Mustang, we are out into 2010 now.", "David Bleustein - UBS", "Terrific. And then the last question. If you have cancellations in your '08, '09 orders books, do you have customers looking to move forward?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Dying to.", "David Bleustein - UBS", "That's all I needed. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Jeff Sprague with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Can you give me a sense of\u2026 the big picture on the LCC, how you think about the business case, whether you are looking at it on an internal rate of return or just kind of cash flow basis, but kind of the break-even volume case for the airplane?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "I will start on that one. We treated this LCC no different than any other major capital investment we have to make or decided to make. So, we look at it on several different fronts. Intrinsic value is the primary one, IRR is right in there beside it. Return on invested capital, we risk adjusted based on pricing, volumes, etcetera. We even forecast to be conservative some type of downturn in the economy during the devolvement cycle. So, we don't have our head in sand there. And I think the amazing fact here is, I came to Textron in \u201992 and except for a very small hiccup in the launch of the Citation 10, which was primarily due the fact we'd never done a total fly by wire aircraft, that was our first one. And come out of car business, I can tell you there are some phantom circuits that exist that you can't really wrestle to the ground until you build a few of those. And so other than the Citation 10, which was a minor, minor deal, operationing brought it up, we just haven't missed on any ship we've decided to do from when started on a piece of paper to when we delivered it to the customer, as I talked about the Mustang example. And I think that because we've done so many of them, we've done\u2026 I don't know how many new ships since we began making in jets in the early \u201870s. So, our cycles of learning on new aircraft is very high. And our understanding of the market is very high and our step-up capacity for customers is unusually high at somewhere between\u2026 well roughly two-thirds, I might say 70%, but certainly two-thirds. So, those factors allow you to be pretty accurate as it relates to what the pricing ought to be and in turn what kind of volume you should expect. And we know what the customers are doing, not many secrets in this business\u2026 sorry, not customers, but we know what the competitors are doing. And so based on all of those facts, our Board approved that for us yesterday, and we are ready to go.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Can you give us a sense on in terms of units, what the business case would be built upon?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We expect to sell, I\u2019ll just say hundreds of units. I don't know that we really want to give that number out. We expect to sell hundreds of units over the course of a decade or so.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "One other fact that we looked at just to make sure that our historical record would support any estimate and that is I don't think there has been a jet certainly in the \u201890s. since I came here, there has not been a jet that was launched that had a forecasted delivery quantity that hasn't far exceeded the delivery quantity or the profits. So, we think we launched on time. We have a track record of keeping our costs in line. We understand how to launch a ship successfully. So, we don't... if you try to produce too many upfront, you can get in trouble, but you've got to satisfy market demand and carefully balance. We've really created a nifty airplane, but we really have been... we are very shrewd about how we did it. I think Jack and his team have done just a wonderful job on this aircraft. We are going to really spend a lot of time on it on February 6 and you can be there on phone or in person, you will find out a lot about it.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Could you just clarify the R&D? I think the $20 million in '07 is the absolute, but the $53 million in '08 is the delta.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "No.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "No?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "The $53 million is in absolute.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay, and then the $120 million in 2010 is an absolute.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, one of the things that we did was why we took our time on this was we wanted to make sure we knew what variance we want to produce and what it was we were designing. And you are probably remembering, because we were using an estimate that could be as much as $85 million.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Yes.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And that's why it's tempting to add the $20 million to the $53 million, but the $53 million is the absolute number.", "Jeffery Sprague - Citigroup", "Okay. I got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Ronald Epstein with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Ron.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Turning that table a little bit. Looking at Bell in a little more detail. The $30 million that you guys took on H-1, what was it up for?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Pardon me.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "The $30 million charge on H-1, what's that related to?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That is related to the fact that we made a decision year plus ago with our customer that on the Yankee we would no longer try to re-man the cabin on that product and that we would build new cabins, and in fact build that entire helicopter as a new built helicopter. And we went outside to a source to procure those cabins and for a number of reasons I don't want to get into, the cost is higher than what was expected. We are having some discussions with the customer and with the supplier about how we are going to allocate all that additional cost among the three of us. Those discussions are not resolved, so we chose in the quarter to take a charge for the next eight upcoming lots where we would absorb potentially some of that cost in transition to getting into the new built helicopter.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Ted, on the H-1, when do you expect it to make money?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We expect it to start making money after the fifth lot, which\u2026 I don't have the delivery schedule here or maybe I do. About 2010 we would start delivering profitable units.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then one more Bell question, if I can. Kind of looking through some of the DoD documents, it looks like the price of the aircraft per ship potentially has gone up a lot. Does that worry you guys because going from, I guess, about $5 million airplane to something close to $12 million or $13 million, it's creeping up towards the price of a Black Hawk, does that worry you guys or not? How should we think about that?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That\u2019s gone up from $5.5 million to, call it round numbers, approaching $10 million.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And we believe and the customer believes that is still the best economic deal out there.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Certainly, not something [inaudible], but it is what it is to get the performance that the customers wants to get.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just one last question. On the LCC, if you guys can answer this, from a CapEx perspective, you guys do to bricks and motor to build... it is a big cabin, right? So there should be a lot of tooling, you probably need space, or is that something you think about outsourcing?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are doing this a little bit differently and that we are going to be buying more of the work outside than what we have traditionally done. So, we will limit that, but if you think about it, the total development program is about $780 million, CapEx is just a little over $100 million of that. So, it is mostly development cost.", "Ronald Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, good morning. Just a [inaudible] little bit with this Cessna margin here, if I look back at '07 and the previous few years, clearly incremental has been pretty good. Even if we strip out the incremental R&D, you are looking at a low 30% incremental margin on revenue growth in 2007 and if we do kind of the same analysis for this year, you are 13 points below that, so you are around 19%. So, that's kind of adjusting for the R&D issue, is the difference there\u2026 that big difference that we see in that number, I mean, is that really other investment and I don't know this\u2026 I don't even know what the name of this company is, you acquired Columbia again?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "So, that is the difference?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Columbia is 70 basis points, the LCC is 90 basis points, other growth and R&D beyond LCC, I don\u2019t have that calculation, that's probably 15 more.", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "I am adjusting the entire R&D increase, so that you guys just give us the pure R&D number, it just seems like a pretty significant degradation in the core incremental margin of the business. I guess the question is, there is nothing unusual going on outside of these items you highlighted that\u2026 that number that much?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Depreciation expense will be the next big one. I mean, this is similar to situation we have at Bell. We went for several years where big steps up in volume were eating up available capacity and coming very, very inexpensively. And as we have now passed that point, we are having to put quite a bit more CapEx into this business in order to grow it, great return by the way, but that is driving our depreciation expense up quite considerably.", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And just the follow-up on that, I mean, you talk about wanting to be a premier multi-industry company, when I look out at the guidance that a lot of these premier companies have given over the last month, even in the face of this environment you are looking at, certainly north of 10% EPS growth\u2026 10% to 15%, 15% is kind of the bar and who knows if they get there. But, for now, they are saying that that is the right bar, some are putting up 20% EPS growth. You got 7% at the mid-point of the range, now I understand there is investment and all this other stuff, but all these other companies are also investing heavily in there business and doing acquisitions and things like that. Do you think that 7% mid-point of the range is enough to get you to premier status, because you guys have used that word quite a bit over the course of this conference call?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You have an interesting definition of premier. How many of them did 32% last year?", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "You guys are talking about a journey here, so it\u2019s\u2026", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That\u2019s exactly right, we are talking about a journey and we would have 14% growth, but for LCC and the two acquisitions and that\u2019s the way life works. This is not a perfect linear progression, but we will work hard to get to a number that\u2019s very strong, if we can make it in \u201908, but we are making investments that we believe are increasing shareholder value, which is really an intrinsic value, which is our ultimate yardstick of what premier looks like.", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "Right, I just think the revenue growth you guys have put up over the last couple of year, you have never had or you very seldomly had an EPS growth rate that\u2019s below your revenue growth rates. So, this year just seems a little bit unusual on that --?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We wouldn\u2019t have but for those three items.", "Stephen Tusa - J.P. Morgan", "Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Let me make two more closing comments real quick. The year is not over yet, but we try give you the best guidance we can, but we don't quit here, 11 more months to run. I want to go back on the Citation 10 because I probably shortcut that answer just a little bit on flight control systems, remember that was the first step well\u2026 that is the only aircraft to save the Concorde, which is no longer flying, that flies at Mach 0.92 or higher, and so if you said technically what was going on there, it was more related to the fairly complicated flight control system than actually fly by wire although they are kind of intertwined there. So, I just want to clear that up.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me do one other thing too because I finally found my missing piece of paper and I know this is of interest to all of you. The LCC current development cost estimates right now for '08, $53 million, $0.14 of share, for \u201909, $97 million, $0.26 a share, for 2010, $120 million, $0.32 a share, and that ought to be at about the peak rate and then it should flatten out, start to drift downward thereafter.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "All right, operator, if we don't have any other calls in queue, this will conclude our call and we thank everybody for joining us today. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference call will be available for replay starting at 12.30 p.m. Eastern Time today.

(NYSE:TXT) Q1 FY08 Earnings Call April 17, 2008 ET", "Executives", "Douglas R. Wilburne - VP, IR", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and CEO", "Ted R. French - EVP and CFO", "Analysts", "Nicole Parent - Credit Suisse", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup Investment Research", "Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Textron's First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.", "Douglas R. Wilburne \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Alex, and good morning everyone. Joining me today are Lewis Campbell, Textron's Chief Executive Officer and Ted French, Ted is Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin I'd like to mention, our discussion today will include remarks about future estimates and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our annual SEC filings and also in today's press release. Finally, you can also find a slide deck containing key data items from today's call in the IR section of our website.", "Beginning with this quarter, we are reporting Textron Systems as a separate new segment. We've named this segment Defense and Intelligence. Correspondingly, Bell Helicopter will also be reported separately as the Bell segment. Historical financial statements have been recast to reflect the new segment reporting structure, and these recast financials for the years \u201803 through \u201807 can be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our company's website.", "Moving now to our results for the first quarter. Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 18.7% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.93, up 19.2% from $0.78 a year ago. You'll see on the free cash flow calculation attached to our press release that we\u2019ve modified our calculation to make our definition more consistent with that being used by most of our peers. Our new definition no longer includes adjustments for capitalized leases and will result in a slightly lower reported free cash flow for the year, but we're not changing our targets. A schedule of free cash flow for the years 2003 through 2007 is included in our key data package accompanying today's call, which again is available on our website. So, free cash flow in the quarter on this new basis was $78 million compared to $28 million a year ago.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Lewis.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning everyone. With our strong first quarter results, we're not only off to a good start for the year, but we also created excellent future growth opportunity, as global demand continues to be brisk across our aircraft and defense businesses, which in turn led to another significant expansion in our backlog during the quarter reaching a new record level. One major contributor to expanding backlog during the quarter came from the V-22 program, as we booked $1.2 billion for the first lot from the new multi-year contract that we inked with the DoD in March.", "We're quite pleased that we're able to reach an agreement for a multi-year commitment, because that essentially removes funding risk, it provides a predictable supply chain environment, and allows us now to focus even more strongly on production improvement and costs. The new contract calls for 167 total units over five lots with deliveries beginning in late 2009 and running through October 2014, and we'll be reaching an annual production rate of 38 per year by 2013. Importantly, the customer also has an option to add five additional units each fiscal year, so there is potential upside there depending on funding availability and mutually agreeable delivery dates. And looking even further in the future, we look forward to additional multi-year contracts at the conclusion of this one, and by that time possibly producing for foreign military demand as well. In the meantime, we're now fully engaged with our supply chain to effect this substantial ramp up in delivery volume and to be prepared for even higher levels of demand, should the government exercise any of its options.", "We also had a nice addition to the backlog at the commercial side of Bell, as we added 51 new helicopter orders reflecting strong demand at the Singapore Air Show and HAI. And we have additional purchase agreements from the shows that will go into backlog, as we complete the contractual requirements necessary to put them into backlog, including orders for the 429.", "And operationally at Bell, we had good margin performance in our commercial business, as cost reductions and positive pricing contributed to improved profitability. On the H-1 program, this aircraft continues in Phase II of operation evaluation as it should be, and we anticipate a successful outcome later this summer. Also during the quarter, we came to an agreement with our new cabin supplier with respect to revised delivery schedule and cost targets and we're new working these issues with the customer for future lots. A Defense Acquisition Board review for a full rate production decision on the H-1 is scheduled for early fall, and we anticipate a contract award for Lot 5, which calls for 15 aircraft soon after that.", "On the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter or ARH, systems development and demonstration activity is going well, and we just received the RFP for the first two lots, which call for 38 aircraft with deliveries beginning in earnest in 2010. We're now working on contractual details of the ARH program with our customer.", "Turning to Cessna, demand also continues unabated at our Cessna unit, as we booked 235 new jet orders. We're quite pleased that this included 36 of our new Columbus model, an excellent start on the initial order book, as well as another validation of the general business jet demand environment. Additionally, we're excited that we booked our 500th Mustang order during the quarter, an impressive milestone for this young aircraft. With our target annual production rate of 150 units, we now have Mustang backlog into 2011.", "Geographically, the overall order pace for business jets on the international front remains robust. However, I have to be quick to point out that the U.S. demand is also strong, as we took 80 orders during the quarter. So, with another quarter of solid global demand, our expectation for increasing jet deliveries over at least the next three years remains solidly intact. We also saw strong demand for our newly acquired model 350 and 400 high-performance single-engine products and increased 2009 production plans as a result. On the other hand, we are seeing some slowing in demand for our legacy single-engine piston line in Independence.", "Financial performance at Cessna was also excellent once again, as we made up most of the profit shortfall associated with delivering nine fewer jets than expected in the quarter. By the way, these delivery misses derived primarily from transactional issues around international deliveries, not production shortfalls. And therefore, we're confident we can hit our full-year target of 470 jets.", "Turning now to our new Defense and Intelligence segment, the integration of AAI is going quite well. In fact, well enough that we just announced the promotion of Fred Strader, he was the former head of AAI to the position of chief operating unit... Chief Operating Officer for the entire segment. We backfilled Fred's position with Ellen Lord, who was an executive at Textron Systems.", "Earlier this week with our partners, Boeing and SAIC, we submitted a proposal for the 27-month technology and development phase of the JLTV program, which is a family of future light tactical vehicles for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. With an estimated 10-year contract value of $30 billion, the JTLV is an important program and we will be making the appropriate developmental expenditures to make our offering competitive.", "At Industrial, excluding foreign exchange, revenue was up about 1%. E-Z-GO and Jake were down reflecting soft golf and turf markets. However, E-Z-GO had a very successful launch of the new RXV golf car, and based on that excellent response we've increased our mix of RXVs in our production targets for the year.", "Organically, Greenlee was approximately flat in the quarter, but has begun to see a slight falloff in demand in future quarters. On the other hand, we have a strong year at Fluid & Power with record backlogs and double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. And we're holding our own to Kautex, as global volumes were up ever so slightly as the rest of the world overcame weakness in the U.S.", "Finally, I'll make a few comments about Textron Financial. Coming into the year, we discussed our expectations for higher loan loss provisions and unfavorable borrowing spreads, which was the primary reason our original outlook was flat on a year-over-year basis. As it turned out, the first quarter was worse than we had planned on both of these accounts. Ted will get into the first quarter details in a minute. But let me continue with a few comments relative to the rest of the year at finance.", "Our revised outlook now reflects a more conservative view based on the expectation that the general economy continues to soften moderately and corporate financing markets remain challenging, but do not deteriorate too much further. On this basis, we're reasonably confident in our outlook reflecting the high quality of asset classes in our portfolio and the rigor of our traditional strong conservative underwriting process. However, we recognize in today's environment there is a risk to any finance outlook, but we believe our risk at TFC is manageable. And importantly, we believe the strength and opportunities in the rest of our enterprise substantially offset this risk. That's a key point.", "In conclusion, we're very pleased with the first quarter, both on the basis of what we've accomplished and in terms of what it signals for our future. We continue to work on our transformation journey, and our selection as one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies this year was confirmation that we are indeed making progress. But let me assure you that that recognition has not caused us to relax in any way relative to our commitment to continuous improvement and our strong determination to create increasing shareholder value well into the future.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Lewis. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here with us. I want to start with a comment about our aircraft and defense backlog, because as large as it is at $22 billion, with the V-22 multi-year it's really over $26 billion if you allow for the unfunded portion of the contract. And on top of that, keep in mind we have another $1 billion in potential backlog for the Bell 429. So, while we have to carefully navigate our way through the current economic challenges, we have tremendous growth ahead of us with excellent visibility.", "Now, let's move back to our analysis of what drove first quarter results. Earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.15 from a year ago, volume and mix provided $0.07, higher pricing of about 2.8% added $0.22 a share, and inflation also 2.8% cost about $0.18 a share. Performance was a positive $0.15 and miscellaneous items, including favorable foreign exchange and a lower share count collectively provided about $0.03. The headwinds of engineering, R&D, and depreciation cost a dime, Textron Financial was lower by $0.03, and corporate expense cost us about a penny. You may be wondering how a $10 million year-over-year decrease in corporate expenses, if you look at our financial statements, could result in an unfavorable EPS causal impact. The answer lies in understanding how we hedge our stock-based compensation exposure to Textron\u2019s stock price movements. Due to the non-taxable nature of gains or losses from the hedge, the impact flows through both corporate expense and the tax rate. Taken together, the effect is EPS neutral, and we remove the impact from both corporate expense and tax rate when we do our causal analysis. So, excluding the impact that our drop in share price had on compensation expense, corporate expenses were actually up about $2 million, which rounds to about a penny a share.", "Now, let's review each segment starting with Cessna. Cessna's revenues increased $278 million in the quarter from last year, reflecting delivery of 95 jets compared to 67 last year, improved pricing, and revenues from the Columbia acquisition. Segment profits were up $52 million, reflecting the additional 28 jets, improved pricing, and favorable warranty performance, partially offset by inflation and increased engineering and product development expense. Cessna's backlog at the end of Q1 was $14.5 billion, up from $12.6 billion at the end of \u201807.", "Bell's revenues decreased $6 million for the first quarter, while segment profits were up $28 million. As a reminder, these results are for Bell Helicopter, as the new Defense and Intelligence segment results would follow. U.S. Government revenues increased $50 million in the quarter due to higher V-22 volume and higher spares and service revenue. These increases were partially offset by lower H-1 program revenue. Revenues for the commercial business were down $56 million due to lower helicopter volume, partially offset by higher pricing and a benefit from newly acquired businesses. The lower volume reflects our emphasis this year to support long-lead component manufacturing for the V-22 ramp up. In the meantime, we're making the necessary manufacturing capacity adds to allow us to significantly ramp commercial deliveries over the next several years.", "U.S. Government profits increased $27 million as a result of improved cost performance and higher volume. Improved cost performance reflected the impact of a $25 million charge for the H-1... excuse me, the ARH program that we took in the first quarter of last year. In the H-1 program during the quarter, we recorded $4.5 million in net cost, reflecting a number of items, including a charge for the impact of the cabin supply issue on the remaining Lot 3 and Lot 4 deliveries.", "On the commercial side of the business, profit was up $1 million, as favorable program performance and higher pricing more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower volume and inflation. I want to point out that the impact of the favorable commercial margin performance while continuing will not be at the same magnitude through the year, so we're forecasting slightly lower margins at Bell for the rest of the year. Bell Helicopter backlog at the end of the first quarter was $5.2 billion, up from $3.8 billion at year-end \u201807.", "Moving to the Defense and Intelligence segment, revenues increased $216 million in the quarter due to the acquisition of AAI, partially offset by the impact of a reimbursement related to Hurricane Katrina in the first quarter of \u201807. Segment profits increased $5 million year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of the AAI acquisition and ASV program adjustments to recognize positive program performance, partially offset by last year's $28 million Katrina reimbursement, inflation, and unfavorable pricing. The ASV benefit in the first quarter is not expected to repeat, so we expect lower margins at D&I for the balance of the year. Backlog at the segment was $2.3 billion, down slightly from year-end.", "Revenues in the Industrial segment increased $62 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange and higher pricing, which more than offset slightly lower overall volumes. Lower volumes reflected decreases at Jacobson and E-Z-GO offsetting increases at Fluid & Power and Kautex. Profit decreased $10 million, as higher pricing only partially offset inflation and asset impairment at Kautex and project launch costs at E-Z-GO.", "Revenues in the Finance segment increased $4 million. This increase reflects an increase in securitization gains and other fee income, higher revenues resulting from higher average finance receivables, and the impact of a residual value impairment charge last year, partially offset by a decline in market interest rates. Profit in the Finance segment was down $10 million due to an increase in the provision for loan losses, primarily in our asset-based lending and distribution finance businesses, and an increase in borrowing costs caused by market conditions, partially offset by the increase in securitization gains and other income.", "The 60-day delinquency percentage declined to 0.33% of finance receivables from 0.43% at the end of last year. However, non-performing assets increased to 1.84% of finance assets, up from 1.34%, but still well within a normal range. The higher NPA primarily reflected softer credit performance in the asset-based lending and distribution finance portfolios, while NPAs remained favorable in our resort, aviation, and golf portfolios.", "Now for our earnings outlook. For the full year, we're forecasting EPS in the range of $3.80 to $4.00 a share, and for the second quarter we expect earnings between $0.90 and $1.00 a share. Our cash flow provided by continuing operations forecast of about $1.3 billion remains unchanged. And likewise, our \u201808 capital program forecast remains about $550 million, which results in expected free cash flow between $700 million and $750 million.", "In closing, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter, and in spite of remaining economic risk at our Finance and Industrial segments, we remain reasonably confident about the rest of this year.", "And now I'm going to turn it over to Doug to give you some additional \u201808 modeling information.", "Douglas R. Wilburne \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Ted. I'll begin with our second quarter outlook. At Cessna, we're expecting revenue to be approximately $1.5 billion with margins of about 16.5%. Our expectation assumes about 115 jet deliveries for the quarter. At Bell, we expect second quarter revenue of around $575 million with margins of about 8%. These revenues reflect anticipated deliveries of three V-22s, one H-1, and about 35 commercial helicopters. At D&I or Defense and Intelligence, we're expecting revenue to be $540 million, with margins of about 9.5%. This forecast reflects about 150 ASV deliveries. Industrial revenue is expected to be approximately $1 billion, with margins around 6%. Finance revenues are projected to come in at $180 million, with segment profit of about $45 million.", "Now for the full year. No appreciable change for Cessna, but to recap we're expecting \u201808 revenue of approximately $6 billion on delivery of about 470 jets, with margins around 16.5%. At Bell, we expect revenue of around $2.6 billion, with margins of 8.5%. Our full-year delivery forecast reflects 17 V-22 deliveries, nine H-1s, which is one fewer than our previous estimate, and about 160 commercial helicopters. At D&I, we're expecting revenue to be about $2.2 billion, with margins of 10%. Industrial revenue is expected to be approximately $3.7 billion, slightly higher than our previous target primarily due to foreign exchange, with margins of approximately 5.5% to 6% reflecting higher commodity costs driven by the weaker dollar. At our Finance segment, our new outlook is for revenues of $765 million, with segment profit of around $200 million. We expect interest expense of about $135 million on the year and corporate expenses of $240 million. Our full-year tax rate is expected to be about 32.5%.", "With that, that concludes our prepared remarks, and before we go to questions, we'll ask that each of you please limit yourself to one question with an optional follow-up to be fair to the other callers. So, Alex, with that we're now ready to open the lines.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Nicole.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes, first just on deliveries as we think about kind of the quarterly space out, it looks like Mustang is going to be back-half loaded. Could you just give us a sense, I guess, first on how you see the mix working out, and then also were there any particular timing issues in the first quarter versus what you're expecting?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The timing relative to deliveries?", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yes.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We had a number of international deliveries that didn't get delivered in the first quarter that we had had previously in our forecast. And they are all a variety of kind of strange events, but not strange in some respects, because we've anticipated that as we get a larger and larger international mix, deliveries are a little bit more challenging from a timing standpoint. So, I won't give you too many anecdotes, but we had a wire transfer that went into the wrong account and didn't arrive until a day late that missed a delivery. We had a strike in Brazil with the regulatory authorities, we couldn't get a plane certified, missed a delivery. There are a number of things like that. All of the aircraft were built during the quarter, so we're in good shape from a production standpoint. Your other question relative to Mustang, Mustangs very much are back-end loaded. We delivered 15 Mustangs in Q1, and we'll ramp all the way up to 38 Mustangs in the fourth quarter. So, that has a couple of impacts. It obviously gives us a lot of confidence. We're going to get our total production for the year because those are coming out of a separate plant and its ramp up is going very well. It obviously also does have some margin impacts, as we get both ramp up related expenses and then lower margins at the early stages of a new aircraft on the Mustangs, as they went from being $35 million of revenue in Q1, they're going to be almost $275 million for the year. So, that does have a pretty meaningful impact.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. And Lewis, you commented on U.S. orders specifically, which I don't recall you guys doing that previously. Could you give us a sense of V80 [ph], is that an acceleration in the U.S., a deceleration, and how should we think about that?", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say if you... I'd say it's pretty balanced actually. We didn't think it would come in that strong. Orders, in total, are stronger than we thought when we entered the year obviously. So, the backlog number and the order rate is exceptionally strong and continues to prove that both international and domestic customers really want our products. What I found interesting, Nicole, to expand on that a little bit, is we usually get the question of what does the backlog look like? The backlog actually is split just about 50/50, international and domestic. So, that's a good way of thinking about it, just coincidentally. And if you then take another look at it, small business, less than Fortune... smaller than Fortune 500 businesses add about 30% to that and individuals, including NetJets, which is 10 plus individual buys, which is about eight. So, you've got a good spread of desire across U.S. constituencies, and then I don't have the breakout of international, but as I said it's about half of our total backlog. Our total backlog in units is about $1.5 billion.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you. [inaudible].", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sorry.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "1,500.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it.", "Douglas R. Wilburne \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations", "1,550.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Shan.", "Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Good morning, guys. Hey Ted, can you just go through what your expectations are around TFC, as you look out the rest of the year, given what you're seeing going on inside the business? I mean how bad do you think it can get assuming what... the deteriorating situation we've seen broadly in the economy and what are you assuming?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, let me give you a couple of data points here. There are really two things that happened to us to knock us off plan in the first quarter. One was another hit or a bigger hit than we had forecasted around the indices mismatch issue, and I think that's going to turn around pretty nicely for us. That cost us, we had about $3.5 million in the forecast and it cost us closer to $8 million to $10 million depending on how you calculate it. But really kind of flukish [ph] in the quarter, because the Fed dropped the Fed fund rates so rapidly, with a 75% followed by another 50% basis point drop that LIBOR did not do a good job this time of anticipating, which it usually does better. So, when that happens, we got a lot of negative re-pricing to our customers that we didn\u2019t offset and we gapped out a little bit.", "The positive thing going forward, it\u2019s not to say that can\u2019t positively happen again, but I don't think you're going to see that kind of reduction happen again. And then the very positive thing for us is, as of the end of the first quarter about $2 billion of our portfolio had hit their what we call prime floors, where customer\u2019s prime rate can\u2019t drop below a fixed amount, no matter how low interest rates go. So, I think we are through the worst of that, but given how these credit markets have behaved, I'm not going to say that ecstatically. But I think we are. And then the other thing that happened to us in the quarter was around loan loss provisions, and it was really isolated to mostly one business. We have a very small business inside of our asset-based lending called the Financial Company Services where we lend to small finance companies. It\u2019s about 2% of our total portfolio and inside of that there is about half of that or about a little over $130 million of exposure is to guys whose collateral is residential real estate and we all know what's going on in the residential real estate market. So, we spent a lot of the quarter going out and looking at each of those clients, it's only six accounts that we have concerns about and we\u2019ve looked at them and done a lot of appraisals of their residential real estates, collateral, and concluded that we needed to put up fairly substantial reserves against that amount. And with what we\u2019ve done in this quarter, we now have almost $20 million of reserves against that $130 million portfolio. So, hopefully there we\u2019ve also kind of taken all of the whack, but to be a little more conservative we did miss our plan by $10 million in the quarter, but we took down the rest of the year by another $10 million to, say, $200 million as a guidance number.", "We've done a bunch of modeling, looking at worse case, best case, how do we counter... plan that and get back to where we wanted to be for the year. And our range in outcomes probably looks anywhere from $175 million worse case to $215 million best case. So, we take $200 million as the most reasonable answer right now, but clearly it's hard to be precise than the finance businesses today. But if you think about it, that's probably in my 90% confidence interval, but it will be somewhere in that range. And clearly if that's the case, that's easily absorbed within the overall range of guidance for the company.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thanks a lot. That helps. And then just on Bell, can you talk through some of these positives, again you can just give\u2026 maybe repeat the numbers and tell us if there\u2019s any other things that don't repeat. I mean you had the Bell piece at a little over 9% margin and the D&I a little over 12%, obviously both of them have to go down a decent amount to get to the guidance for the year. So, can you just size the non-repeatable benefits?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, we did have. It's hard to call things non-repeatable at Bell, because as you know we\u2019ve got a lot of program adjustments that just happen all the time. But clearly on the commercial side, we had very, very strong program adjustments, about $10 million favorable was across a number of programs. The single biggest pickup though is definitely not going to be repeatable, although it's a good news story for the future and that's on the Bell 427, which is a helicopter we're still building. The end of its life is coming, as we are introducing the 429. We had marked down that program and taken lots of charge-offs back over the years based on unsold units based on an expectation of what pricing is going to be. And with the tremendous robustness that we are seeing in the commercial helicopter space right now, we have dramatically increased the price of that helicopter and pretty much sold out the rest of its life. That alone picked up $6 million in the quarter and will now result and that being a profitable program for the rest of its production run, where it had been a breakeven program than our prior expectations. But that won't... that'll be smaller amounts each quarter as units get delivered.", "So, I would call that largely a one timer and those commercial adjustments unlike they could be as strong. On the other hand, we had a small net negative charge on H-1 during the quarter as well. So, it's really hard to honestly say this or that item is totally a one timer at Bell because we got a collection of them, but clearly our forecast going forward doesn't have those commercial impacts repeating. So, we do have a lower margin assumed for the balance of the year. They also had by the way a\u2026 we are ramping up IR&D and overhead rates at Bell along our program for new product development, as well as capacity expansion. And they are a little behind in the first quarter, so that was good news for the quarter. Bell was still trying hard to make that all up and spend it by the time the year is over. We may have some opportunity if some of that slips out, but we really do need to get all that work done. So, it's getting a little bit back-end loaded as well.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "And then just the... and the ASV or any other benefits in the D&I piece?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, huge. ASV benefit in the quarter we closed out the first two contract lots for ASV and had a [inaudible] $15 million benefit come out of that. I think there is potentially more good news coming out of ASVs, as we get well down the learning curve and we're doing well on it. But that was clearly a big one timer in the quarter.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Citigroup Investment Research. Please go ahead.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Hi, thanks, good morning everyone.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Maybe just a follow-up, a quick one on Bell and the miscellaneous charges and everything. I think you guys actually thought you overcompensated on this cabin issue in Q4 and maybe we're going to get some back from the supplier and yet you've taken a little bit more. Do you see any signs of that reversing back later in the year and is there an open item on this helmet yet that maybe is a question mark on H-1 costs over the course of the year?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "On the cabin supply, we... at the end of last quarter we booked our best estimate based on our position with the supplier. Obviously, they were asking for a different number than we were, but we have now completed negotiations and reached a conclusion with the supplier around... as much of a schedule has cost and what the schedule changes due to the overall program cost profile and that's what we booked in the second quarter. So, I don't think there is any change coming to that.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, this is Lewis. On the helmet, well, let me just say a couple of things. You may not recall, but the Phase II operation evaluation has been a planned event since we exited Phase I because the helmet the government picked once the war fighter flew it, they decided they didn't like that design. So, they decided to change it. That's a government furnished specified gear, it's not ours, but still on our helicopter. And so operation evaluation, Phase II started as it was supposed to and we also cleaned up some issues from up about one that just ought to be cleaned up just because it makes a better helicopter. Second, the war fighter really needs this machine because it outperforms its existing models in the field dramatically. And so, this is how we are going to see through to fruition, this is how we are going to put into combat as quickly as we can, and there is no\u2026 there is all pull and no push back on this one from the government, I can tell you that. I don\u2019t\u2026 we don't really have any visibility on Phase II up above because they put kind of a cone of silence around that. And so you don't really know till you exit what the result is, but truthfully this is in such high demand and there is no other alternative for this product that no matter what comes out of operation evaluation, we\u2019ll fix it and go on down the road. So, it won't affect our production rate any because it's not a phasing time for us.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And could you give us a little bit color on how things are playing out with Columbus, obviously a good start, are you feeling good about that 70-unit target for the year?", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I talked to Jack on a couple of times here this last month on a variety of different issues and yes, he feels pretty good about this. Golf, a pretty good start first quarter. You don't know how the economy is going to move up and down the balance of the year depending on who you read and on what particular day and then what publication, but assuming things stake out under the way we think they're going to stay, we feel pretty good about that number of 70, it might grow up or down a little bit. But the fact that you are getting that many orders for a plane that\u2019s not going to commerce for 2013 Christmas, that's a fabulous thing. Imagine laying a $1 million on the table and getting your first one\u2026 get somewhat\u2026 putting some more in and you\u2019ll be able to fly your investment in 2014, for example. But it just shows how strong Cessna\u2019s brand is. So, I really feel good about this, that slightly got off to a good start. I think it represents the brand well and it represents our future well. So, I feel good about it.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "36 was ahead of the pace we thought we had at the end of March.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, really.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And we think about this going in the backlog at what $27 million, $28 million, that's the number that hit in the quarter?", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, well, the first 50 at 26. So, those would have all been at 26.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And then just one quick follow-up on TSC, if I could. Ted, there was a lot of color you gave I think to Shannon's question. Just maybe additionally just what part of the balance sheet do we think of just being out of sync with this spread issue, your funding cost versus what you can charge to customers? And secondly, what will do securitizations to guidance this year?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, we've got... it's about $8 billion out of our $11 billion plus is floating rate paper. Of that we have a little less than half of that that\u2019s got floor rates though. So, we are... that's the positive as we go forward. And we probably have about over $2 billion of floors that have actually already been tripped by the rates\u2026 levels that we have today. So, going forward, we have less exposure to the mismatch and I also don't think we're going to see the kind of circumstances, of course, knock on wood, every time we think those credit markets are getting normal again, something else goes squarely. But I don't think we're going to see just because I don't think the Fed has the room to do what they did on a repeat in the first quarter again. So, I think that issue is largely behind us. But not to say there is zero risk. And I think the more interesting one is continuing to watch these portfolios where we have collateral that's getting stressed a little bit. We think we've looked at it pretty well, we've got a whole series of field reviews, we are going out to the field to every account in the whole Financial Company Services group during the second quarter. We\u2019ve got our strict process around what type of appraisals we have to get on what types of properties, etcetera. So, we will continue to be all over it, we probably had two full-day credit committee meetings that have only looked at these accounts. So, we think we have our hands around it. Could there be some more exposure? Yes. Is it a big number? I don't think so. And that's kind of why we took the guidance down to the $200 million mark.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "And just securitizations?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "What specifically?", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "How much are they going to be up year-over-year or are they going to be up year-over-year?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In total securitzations, I think they will be up slightly, we did 62 in '06, 60 last year, and it will probably be up from that a little bit, this year we had...", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not much so.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Not a lot, no.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citigroup Investment Research", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Steve.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Steve.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi, just a question on the delivery misses this quarter and on previous quarters you guys have actually delivered an extra jet here or there and it has had an unusual impact. What are the... what's the impact on the margin of not delivering those eight extra plans. Is there any impact on the Cessna margin?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it would be modestly positive. I mean on an as-delivered basis because of the typical to ASR sales commissions on international delivery, they are a little bit less. It doesn't mean they are less long term because we\u2019ve got more fixed infrastructure supporting the domestic deliveries, but on... in a quarter on a contribution margin basis, they are a little less. So, margins would have been helped by having those deliveries be missed.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "Right. That's an extra $80 millionish of revenues that you are losing out on and those should fall through at an incrementally higher rate.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'm sorry.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "$80 million of the incremental revenue that you are missing out on at a higher rate than what you reported?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Less than $80 million. But no, we missed them, they would have been at a little lower rate.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "If we had delivered all the international... obviously, we would have higher revenues. But we probably would have had a slightly lower margin. But not around the year almost.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Got you. And then on the Bell side with regards to commercial, I mean how much price you're getting there now?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It depends on the product. We have probably 5% or 6% on average on delivered product.", "Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "Got you. Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Yes. Thank you, and terrific orders at Cessna.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Cai.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Cai.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "If we back out Columbus, you did 199 orders, and your plan was 500 for the year. So, kind of that means 300 if the plan is the same. Is that the same or should we be raising that number and could you give us some color in terms of the progression going through the quarter? Did it slow as we went through the quarter? And kind of what's the color right now you are seeing international and domestic?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, first of all we are on track to get the orders that we need for the year, that's not a number we are going to continually update. But you can certainly assume we're... we're well on track to get what we need to get through the course of the year. And I think while we did end up higher in the last month than what we said, the progression of orders through the quarter was pretty steady. We tend to get a rush of orders the last month of a quarter, any way sales went out there pushing to wrap something up and get it in the book. But we had pretty solid January, February and probably a little stronger March.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Okay. And any color kind of going forward and what you're seeing domestic and international?", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, obviously international is going like gangbusters, but both were strong. I think it's coming from all over the world and it's been very robust.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And again with the1,555 orders in backlog even if we do eventually see a slowdown in orders, we are still very comfortable with our outlook for growing deliveries over the next three years.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, orders is not really going to be the driver... backlog.", "Lewis B. Campbell \u2013 Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Cai. [inaudible] that's all about. As we got ready to talk about backlog and all that was\u2026 what's really happened out there? My take on what's really happening if you remember the spreads of who is buying the planes. And I don't have the split of who is buying them internationally, I just have [inaudible] category of international, I\u2019ll get that the next time we have a call. But first of all, the international business is surprisingly and finally strong and I think it's going to get stronger. So, it\u2019s just exactly what we thought would happen, but it\u2019s happened sooner than we thought, if you follow that. And who knows when the China skies are going to open, but you hear that China has now opened a cordon through the skies for the business jets to fly in for the Olympic. So, what's that going to do for that market and we're selling into China now, but not in huge numbers, but we\u2019ll represent it there. So, I think internationally you can just almost predict that that's going to be a strong opportunity for us and our planes really fit well with a lot of the needs of international customers. Then, if you look here domestically, we have such a broad cross-section of the business that buy our product, which is good. It\u2019s not one single, five big companies buying a bunch of our planes. It's a big spread and NetJets, although they are not a big portion of our number, they are only 10% in the total outlook, which is not a huge number by any stretch. Where are those planes going? Well, we don't have those tracked, at least, not in front of me right this minute. But some portion of their orders are going internationally as well and they are telling us to speed up our deliveries to them, so they can place them internationally. So, it's looks to me like the demand is pretty solid, and I really like the fact we got those 80 orders in the U.S. Because that just confirmed and everything we\u2019re looking at that predicts downturn in order delivery is not telling us it\u2019s going to turn down.", "Ted R. French \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let me give a little piece of technical color we don't usually do, but just to give you a sense of the breath. We sold\u2026 in the first quarter we took orders for 80 in the U.S., 59 in Europe, 38 in Latin America, 30 in Asia-Pacific, 14 in Mid East-Africa, six in Mexico, four in Canada, and four in international unknown, whatever that means. So, it's very broad based and it's becoming much more of a global business.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Co.", "Terrific. Thank you. Great answer, guys.", "Lewis B.

[Operator Instructions].", "And I would now like to turn the conference over to Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Leah, and good morning everyone. Joining me today are Lewis Campbell, Textron's Chief Executive Officer and Ted French, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to mention our discussion today will include remarks about future estimates and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our annual SEC filings and also in today's press release. Finally, you can also find a slide deck containing key data items from today's call in the IR section of our website.", "Revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, up 21% from a year ago. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.03, up 21% from $0.85 in last year's second quarter. Relative to our updated guidance, which specified a range of $0.93 to $0.98, the factors that contributed to the $0.05 performance above that range were two additional jet deliveries and stronger performance at Cessna and AAI. Free cash flow through the first six months was $221 million or $220 million compared to $145 million in '07.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Lewis.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Doug, good morning everybody. Even in the midst of prevailing economic weakness and challenges in our finance segment, we achieved another solid overall result this quarter, and we continue to build backlog for our future, which is also important.", "Before I dive into the details, I would like to go back and review what our initial economic assumptions were coming into 2008. I'd say our world has changed a bit, and I want to update you now on how we're thinking about the balance of the year and beyond. In January, back then we were expecting modest world economic growth with commodity prices remaining at what was perceived to be back then pretty high levels. In United States, credit and housing issues were expected to result in a mild downturn with soft corporate profits at least mid-year. Well, as we all know, since we first discussed our outlook, oil has been up by over $50 per barrel versus end of your last year and other commodities are up significantly as well. This is having a direct impact on us to increase cost particularly in our Industrial segment. Higher commodity costs have also further stressed the U.S. and global economies. Nonetheless, strong performance in our Aircraft and Defense businesses, the size and resiliency of our backlog and the actions we are taking give us the confidence to maintain our overall outlook for the rest of the year and beyond, a key point.", "So, let's take a closer look at what's going on in each of our businesses, and what we think it says about our future. I'll start with TFC, where we encountered a number of late quarter developments. Before I do that, I like to revisit what I said on our call in April, when we discussed the risks around TFC and its forecast. What I said was, we believe our risk at TFC is manageable, and that strengthened opportunities in the rest of our enterprise would substantially offset this risk. Well, that's exactly what happened. I mean if you also participated in our TFC Investor meeting and webcast in April. There we provided an in-depth review of the portfolio and our processes to manage the risks. We did this so you have a better appreciation of our assets knowing that we were in a difficult credit environment.", "Then in May and June, the continued difficulties in the credit environment began to more significantly affect some of our customers. Accordingly, we conducted a very comprehensive review of our assets and have reduced our outlook for TFC for the rest of the year, reflecting sustained credit challenges. And by the way, we will be conducting another Investor Call on August 6th to provide an in-depth look at the TFC portfolio in this tougher environment and to give you the benefit of reviews we have undertaken. I hope you can all join us.", "Let\u2019s move now to Industrial, where the impact of the economy is somewhat different in each division. But, still overall we had nearly 8% organic growth in the quarter. For example, on the positive side, E-Z-GO sales were up significantly as our new RXV golf car is selling very well. And pricing is robust almost offsetting commodity pressures. We expect E-Z-GO will continue to have a very good year led by the RXV.", "At Jacobsen, we had a pretty good quarter with positive organic growth and improved performance. But, we expect softness for the rest of the year. Demand at Fluid & Power remains very strong, reflect... largely reflecting strength in the global economy sector... sorry, energy sector, pardon me.", "At Greenlee, we saw demand fall off very late in the quarter, and expect further weakening through the rest of the year. However, the strength of new products we\u2019re rolling out will offset a large portion of the end-market softness. So, that's good news as well.", "Finally, at Kautex, there really are three separate stories. First, non-naphtha markets are up solidly in Q2, but we expect slower growth during the second half. Number two, in absolute contrast, North American volumes are down substantially and are expected to continue downward. And then third, and most consequential, is the lag of price [inaudible] on commodity cost increases which are significantly pressuring margins. We're taking appropriate cost actions to react to the volume falloffs and we are also implementing a pricing strategy to protect us for future commodity exposure, which we think will be very successful. But frankly, it is going to take several quarters before we see positive results on the second item. So in Industrial, we\u2019ve slightly reduced our second-half margin outlook to reflect the tougher commodity environment.", "Now, moving to Defense and Intelligence, organic growth topped 10% and we again had positive execution on a number of programs. For example, our AAI acquisition, Doug mentioned this at the start of the call, it's tracking ahead of plan, and looking down the road, work on new synergistic product offerings looks very promising. We are also pursuing a number of foreign military UAV opportunities, and we are pleased that the recently passed supplemental budget included funding for UAVs as well as armored security vehicles.", "This extends further U.S. Government UAV production through early 2011, and ASV production through early 2010, so we're off to a great start. We also received a new contract for Motor Life Boats from Mexico with deliveries in 2010. So, the outlook for D&I remain strong and should be relatively unaffected by the economy.", "Now let's move to Bell. The business outlook is also positive and execution continues to advance. Obviously, the market expressed concern around last week's announcement that the Army was moving forward with a non [inaudible] review of the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program. However, we view this as positive news, as this is the next required step to get this program approved for full rate production and given that the ARH design has been... has evolved and is the right design for the war fighter, the cost of the program has necessarily risen as a result.", "While there is also the possibility that a program on review could be cancelled, the Army needs this rate of capability, and we believe we have the best solution from a cost, performance and schedule point of view. Keep in mind that an examination of alternatives was conducted by the Army last year with ARH and it proved to be the preferred solution. So, we expect the outcome will be the same this time. We are working with our customer to expedite the review and obtain funding for the first 10 production representing units.", "In the meantime, we continue to work under the SDD contract, 3 prototype aircraft are already flying and have accumulated nearly 1,300 hours of flight testing and are performing well. Over on the AH-1 program, off about two tests were completed and we expect full rate production approval for the Yankee portion of the program later this year. The [inaudible] on the other hand, has a few fixable technical issues around systems integration of customer-provided gear, and we expect to get these resolved quickly and will continue with limited rate production and anticipate a full rate decision for the [inaudible] next year. And finally the V-22 program is performing very well. We're delivering aircraft consistent with cost targets and actually ahead of schedule. Actual operation in this sphere has been very positive. The program also received budget approval for eight additional units with deliveries beginning in 2010, providing yet further visibility into Bell's long-term outlook.", "Now let's finish with Cessna, where the story remains extremely strong. And we say this against the backdrop of the current economic environment and its potential impact on order flow, cancellations and pricing. So, let's start with current results, and then talk about planned considerations for the future. I want to remind everyone on the call that over the last two years, we've been managing a fairly aggressive expansion in capacity. Importantly, doing so while still improving cost efficiencies. With two quarters behind us, we believe we're solely on track to deliver our target of 470 jets this year, up 21% from last year.", "Also on the execution side, our Single Engine Prop acquisition is proceeding quite successfully with integration and revenue synergies going well and restructuring costs running less than planned, another good new story. Moving to the demand front, we booked an additional 35 orders for our new Columbus product in the quarter. This brings total Columbus orders to 71, an excellent debut for this exciting new high revenue product. Including Columbus, we booked a total of 201 orders in the quarter reflecting strong demand from international markets.", "Overall then, we've booked 437 total orders in the first half, most of which are earmarked for delivery in 2010 and beyond. Including CitationShares, that brings our total backlog to 1,638 jets, which is about 3.5 times our current annual production. The point here is, this backlog gives us complete confidence to raise production next year, and we are currently targeting about 535 jets for which we are 95% sold out already.", "The question now becomes where do the deliveries go from here in 2010 and 2011. And obviously the answer is a function of three things. Our current backlog, where net order rates go over the next three years and one\u2019s view of the long-term global business jet demand. Let's start with the last factor, long-term demand. Over the past several years, we witnessed a growth in international orders, which in turn is the result of an early stage adoption of business jets in new markets around the world. We do not believe this phenomenon is temporary. In fact, we believe international market adoption rates will accelerate in concert with the global economic expansion particularly as the use of business jets continues to become more culturally acceptable, international infrastructures are built out and sovereign policy barriers are eliminated. Based on low existing penetration rates, our analysis suggests that global demand will grow to at least 700 Citation deliveries per year within five years, 700. Obviously, the rate of adoption will be impacted by how the world economy evolves, but this level of the demand is very realistic with only modest assumptions about adoption rates.", "Now let me move to the second factor, net order rates, which are the result of gross orders minus cancellations. Given the current economic environment over the next several quarters, we do expect a slowing in orders at Cessna. We said that several quarters, by the way, at least comparing to the blistering rates we've seen over the past seven quarters. Furthermore, with our most popular models not having availability in 2010 or 2011 and in the case of the CJ4, 2014, one just has to expect order rates to normalize. However, we still do not believe the severe order downturn will develop, especially when you consider the continued deterioration in the commercial travel experience and the further planned contraction in routes served. So, as we look at \u201808 orders, we're very encouraged that we will likely see our original forecast of 570 orders by a significant margin, although we expect second half orders will be less than the first half, obviously. Reflecting the initial surge of Columbus orders and the two successful international biz jet shows early in the year. Looking to \u201809, we're not expecting a precipitous drop in orders, but we do expect rates will be less than next year's delivery plan based on the lack of availability of open slots and also probably some softness in the economy. Beyond that, it's too early to call as it will depend upon how the global economy develops over the next 18 months.", "So now we come to our third factor, and that\u2019s one we cannot overemphasize, and that is the size and resiliency of our current backlog. At 3.5 times our \u201808 production, this provides tremendous balance. As we shared in January, this backlog can be stressed as severely as the last business cycle and we'd still need to expand capacity to service the systemic demand that we see in the marketplace for Citations over the next several years. Yes, sure. A portion of our backlog are susceptible to normal cancellations or deferrals and we'll likely see some cancellations. However within our backlog, there is significant interest among customers to move up in their position and therefore we do not view cancellations as a significant risk to our outlook.", "So in summary, even with the current global economic environment being what it is, we believe we'll have up delivery years in 2009 and again in 2010 and again in 2011. So let me close by saying we're pleased with our overall progress at Textron so far this year, both in terms of results and in preparing for the future, but from a management perspective, this is not a one-size-fits-all situation. As some of our businesses are entering a period of contractions where we're responding appropriately while others are still very much in the growth mode. In fact we continue to believe that Textron is somewhat unique in that the largest portion of our business should see sustained growth over the next several years. Our total aircraft in the Defense backlog of $23.5 billion, another all time record, gives us visibility and confidence in this outlook.", "My final comment is about our recent announcement that Scott Donnelly has joined Textron as our Chief Operating Officer. You know, talent management is a keystone of our transformation strategy at Textron and somewhat of Scott's caliber is a major addition to an already excellent team. We're extremely pleased that Scott sees the substantial potential at Textron, and wants to help shape our future, I'm sure he will.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Ted. Ted?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Lewis and good morning everyone. We appreciate you being here with us. I want to start with a few comments about the economic environment. We're in an unprecedented territory with the current price of oil and other commodities, and there appears to be no clear consensus on whether these rates represent some sort of bubble or if this is a new systemic level based on supply and real demand. And as a result, where prices are going to go from here.", "On the other hand, we are also entering a new world era with many emerging economies now consuming our products. The upshot is that while we expect some uncertainty for some period of time, plus contraction in demand in some of our markets, we believe our long-term outlook is very positive.", "Now, let's move on to our analysis of what drove second quarter results. Earnings per share from continuing ops were up $0.18 from a year ago. Volume and mix provided $0.19, higher pricing of about 3.2% added $0.29 a share, while inflation also about 3.2%, cost us $0.23 a share. Performance across our businesses was a positive $0.19 and acquisitions provided a benefit of a penny. Headwinds from engineering, research, development and depreciation cost $0.12 and Textron Financial was lowered by $0.15.", "So, let's start our normal segment discussion this time with Textron Financial. Revenues at Finance were down $62 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower market interest rates and a decrease in fee income which reflected last year's $21 million gain from the partial sale of a leveraged lease, offset by about $5 million in higher securitization gains this year.", "Revenues were also reduced by the Sale-In, Lease-Out issue we announced last month. Profits in the Finance segment decreased $55 million due to an increase in the provision for loan losses, the decrease in fee income, again that $21 million gain from last year, an impact of higher borrowing cost relative to various market rate indices and the SILO adjustment. These reductions in profit were partially offset by a benefit from increased deals on loans with interest rate floors and a reduction in selling and administrative expenses.", "The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily driven by a reserve established for one account in the golf finance portfolio and an increase in the overall loan loss provision in our distribution finance portfolio as general U.S. economic conditions have continued to impact borrowers in certain industries.", "The 60 day plus delinquency percentage increased to 0.61% of finance receivables from 0.33% at the end of the first quarter, but still a very low number. But, nonetheless non-performing assets increased to 2.31% of total assets from our first quarter level of 1.84%. Looking forward to the rest of the year at TFC, we've reduced our outlook to incorporate higher credit losses and continued pressure on interest margin. Based on the composition and quality of our portfolio, we do not believe that Textron Financial represents the level of risk that the markets have seen with other financial companies. And we look forward to having a more detailed discussion about our view with all of you on August 6. In conclusion, we believe our forecast properly reflects the additional stress our finance businesses will experience for the rest of the year.", "Moving now to Cessna. In the second quarter, revenues and profits were up $298 million and $62 million respectively. Revenues increased primarily reflecting the delivery of 117 Citation business jets compared to 95 last year, and also due to improved pricing. Profits increased due to the impact from the higher volumes, improved pricing, partially offset by inflation and increased engineering and product development expense.", "Bell revenues were up $102 million and profits were up $61 million. Revenues in Bell's U.S. Government business increased $97 million, due to higher H-1 and V-22 deliveries and increased spares and service volume. U.S. Government profits were up $64 million as a result of improved cost performance largely attributable to the non-recurrence of last year's $48 million charge for the ARH and of course contributions from this year's higher volume.", "Revenues for Bell's commercial business were up $5 million due to higher pricing and the benefit of newly-acquired businesses partially offset by lower helicopter delivery volumes. Commercial profits were down $3 million, reflecting inflation, unfavorable cost performance and the lower volumes partially offset by stronger pricing.", "Moving to the Defense and Intelligence segment. Revenues were up $209 million due to the acquisition of AAI and higher volumes in Armored Security Vehicle aftermarket products, Intelligent Battlefield Systems, Joint Direct Attack Munitions and Lycoming products, which were partially offset by lower Sensor Fused Weapons. Profit increased $15 million as a result of the benefit of the AAI acquisition and favorable pricing which were partially offset by unfavorable cost performance and inflation.", "Revenues in our industrial segment increased to $137 million, while profits were down $1 million. Revenues increased primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, some higher volume and higher pricing and a benefit from acquisitions. Profit decreased as higher pricing, favorable exchange rates and improved cost performance were essentially offset by inflation.", "Now, for our earnings outlook. For the full year, we are still confident in our EPS forecast of $3.80 to $4, which is unchanged, and we are initiating our third quarter earnings forecast at $0.80 to $0.90 a share. Our projected free cash flow provided by continuing operations forecast remains unchanged at $700 million to $750 million.", "Finally, on uses of cash, this year we've made three acquisitions, SkyBOOKS at Bell helicopter and Telephonics, and most recently Unilux at Greenlee. And we've also repurchased 3.5 million shares of stock including 1.9 million late in the second quarter putting us well ahead of our original full year plan. We intend to continue making bolt-on acquisitions and share repurchases in a manner that we think maximizes value for our shareholders.", "And now, I'm going to turn it over to Doug and ask him to give you a little more 2008 modeling information. Doug?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President, Investor Relations", "All right. Thank you, Ted. Now, I'll begin with our third-quarter outlook. At Cessna, we are expecting revenue to be approximately $1.5 billion with margins of about 16.5%. Our expectation assumes jet deliveries in a range of 120 to 125 for the quarter. At Bell, we are expecting third-quarter revenue of around $570 million with margins of about 8%. These revenues reflect delivery of two V-22s, two H-1's and somewhere between 40 to 45 Commercial helicopters. At D&I we are expecting revenue to be about $545 million with margins of about 9.5%. This forecast reflects about 150 ASVs.", "Industrial revenue was expected to be approximately $900 million with margins at about 3.5% reflecting normal summer seasonality at Caltex. Finance revenues are projected to come in at $175 million plus or minus with the segment profit at about $30 million. Now, for the full year, for Cessna, we're expecting still '08 revenues of about $6 billion, but we slightly bumped full year margins to about 17%.", "At Bell, we're also reconfirming our revenue projection of around $2.6 billion with margins up about 9%. While this margin is up from our previous full year guidance of 8.5% when you work through your models you'll see that second half margins are expected to be down from the first half. Primary drivers here are positive program adjustments booked in the first half and higher expected R&D spending in the second.", "At D&I, we're still on track for revenues of about $2.2 billion with margins of about 11%, up about 100 basis points from our previous guidance. D&I margins will also be a bit lower in the second half on a sequential basis due to the non-reoccurrence of favorable program adjustments.", "At Industrial revenue, still expecting about $3.7 billion with a lower margin expectation of about 5% now reflecting the higher commodity costs that we spoke about before. Finally, at our Finance segment, our new outlook is for revenues of about $750 million and we're pegging profit for the full year now at about $130 million. We expect interest expense of about $120 million and corporate expenses of about $220 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 32% and 33%.", "Finally on the call with TFC coming up on August 6, we'll be issuing a notice with all the calling information for that, but you may want to note your calendars that we'll begin that call at 4:00 p.m. Eastern. In addition to Ted and me, we'll also have Jay Carter, President of TFC, Tom Cullen, CFO, and Angelo Butera, Chief Credit Officer at Textron Financial. So with that, that concludes our prepared remarks. Before we go to questions, I'd like to ask each of you who queue in to please limit yourselves to one question with an optional follow-up. And with that, Leah, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Jeff Sprague from Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Thanks, good morning everyone.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Jeff.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Hey, I guess the fundamentals are what they are Lewis, but everybody's kind of scratching your head here today, right. The stock got rattled with this guidance heightened late in the quarter, you beat that and now we've got, kind of Q3 guidance where the margins need to be down year-over-year and sequentially in every business. It just kind of begs the question of, the type of visibility you really have into the business, and I guess I\u2019d like a little bit more understanding of why the margins would be down sequentially across the board Q2 into Q3?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, let me tackle the margin piece specifically, and then Lewis can add in if he wants to on the visibility questions. The largest answer to that is the continued ramp-up of R&D development and that's the primary driver at Bell's business. When we put Dick in there, he turned down some of the investments for a period of time to make certain that he was comfortable with all the product development programs, and where those programs were going. And, that's starting to come back onstream. And in the second half versus the first half between IR&D and SG&A we would probably have about a $40 million growth in that investment. And those are all investments we think are critically important to the future of the business, and are driving the organic growth for many, many years to come. But, there is a bit of a... the timing factor between the first half and the second half. On the Cessna side, it's somewhat the same, but there is... it's also compounded with some product mix. We're ramping up more Mustangs in the second half, more single engine, there is more revenues coming out of CitationShares, and perhaps most importantly, we'll have a much larger used aircraft sales coming through in the second half, which essentially have no margins. So, there is nothing going on there with the fundamentals of Cessna's performance. It's really a mix of sales, and then likewise, engineering development costs for the second half for almost $30 million higher at Cessna than in the first half. So, I would say there is nothing fundamentally different. It's really just a normal ebb and flow of how things get timed through the course of the year. We pushed hard to get some deliveries out there in the second quarter that could have just as well happened in the third quarter. So, nothing that's fundamental.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And the thing I would add Jeff is, if you've\u2026 I tried to make this point, maybe I didn't do it as well as I could have. But, if you think about where we were at the beginning of the year, and we've taken guidance up once already this year, and the fact that oil is up basically 50%, $50 a barrel, probably a little more than that. And the fact that the global economy has certainly not gotten any better to say, to make a simple comparison versus year-end of '07, but I think our company has shown great resiliency, and as I've said a couple of times on calls in the past, it's certainly interesting to note and should give our Investors confidence that so much of our business is very solidly locked in this sector growth that doesn't relate to the economy. You take Bell, you take Cessna, you take Defense and Intelligence, those businesses are so solidly positioned, and you really don't read anything these days that says anybody has got a better position in any of those markets than we do. So, I feel very good about Textron right now and our future as a matter of fact. So, and our backlog, needless to say, is certainly very strong. I can say that with a smile. I've never felt better about our backlog and that bodes well for our future as well.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And I guess, as maybe a sign of that confidence, I mean there was some share repurchase in the quarter. But, it was this quarter a year ago that you guys raised a dividend, and announced a share repurchase, why not step it up here in the phase of a very weak stock and a lot of uncertainty in the outlook among Investors?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, we're being very tactical in that regard and we did step it up very significantly for the period of time we were able to be in the market right at the end of the second quarter. We're balancing that against the fact that we made certain commitments, when we acquired AAI that we would rapidly get the balance sheet back to where it was before that acquisition, and we are way ahead of schedule on that and we have essentially gotten there in two quarters versus the four quarters that we originally talk to the rating agencies about. So, we've got to balance that. We have to also balance the fact that there are some liquidity concerns out there in the market. We have not had any real problems, but we want to be sure we don't have any problems as well, but I think you can continue to expect us to be very tactical in our execution and we certainly like the stock at the price right now as a buyer.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And next we move on to the line of Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Steve.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Steve.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "What's the... can you just maybe talk through Brazil, what gives you the confidence in your TFC projections given the volatility you have seen lately maybe... and a little bit more detail and that we can get more, I guess, on the August call, but just at a higher level?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we started a... let me just start by saying there is a lot of uncertainty in the markets that are out there, it would be na\u00efve to say otherwise, but we've spent the latter part of this quarter as we start to see some things coming up doing some very deep dives into some of our businesses and really all of our businesses and doing it with some independent reviews where we send people from different businesses and to look at other people's businesses as opposed to their own to try to get a unbiased, unvarnished view of what could happen and we've run a whole series of models and scenarios around great environments and around potential charge-offs in each of the businesses, potential non-performing assets in each of the businesses and we've taken the number down pretty aggressively and we've taken it down to a number that we think is the most likely case right now. But, I still say that also with the confidence that whichever way TFC moves around and I think we\u2019ve put the number in at a guidance that's the midpoint. The range of guidance for Textron in total is still quite significant between $3.80 and $4 and we have high confidence that that\u2019s what we're going to deliver in the end if TFC is a little better or a little worse it's not going to take us off that march.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then maybe could you just walk through a couple of the puts and takes and a little bit... quantify them a little bit more on the Bell and D&I side with regard to the margin stepdown in the second half of the year looking at the volume projections. It just looks a little bit conservative, but you talked about program adjustments, there are a lot of moving parts, maybe could you just step us down\u2026 help us step down to that level in the second half?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think, at D&I, it's primarily program adjustments we did over the course of the first two quarters, close out the first two original large lots of ASVs and those both closed out with substantial profit pickups as a result of our continuing learning curve performance on that program as we move into later lots where we had the benefit of longer history and better estimates. We have some potential, I wouldn't say there is none to get some additional good news on those lots as they progress. But, right now we are not projecting that we'll have the same big program pickups on those that we\u2019ve had in the first half. And that is the... that's the primary driver. Could we have\u2026", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "How much was that in the second quarter?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "How much was the ASV pickup in the second quarter?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hang on, one second, we\u2019ll try to find that. And then, let me keep going and we'll come back to that. In Bell, it is primarily, this year I think I really already gave the answer to which is the way that they have chosen to hold down the IR&D that we've given them as an approval for the year in the first half and some other development... global development expenses in SG&A and those two things are\u2026  it's almost exactly 40 million higher in the second half than the first half and that's the primary driver. We also had some net small pickups on program reviews at Bell in the first half that we are not projecting in the second half but that's not as significant as the ASV pickups.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Sorry, what was that ASV pickup again?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We're still trying to get that number, hang on a while.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "All right. Thanks a lot. And then one more question is\u2026", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The answer is $8 million in the second quarter.", "C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan", "$8 million. And then one more question is, what are the gating factors for that, Cessna production target next year, I mean, is that kind of an inflexible number given the supply constraints or how much variability do you think is around that number, if you have a pretty precise number as opposed to a range?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Steve I think that number is pretty solid. We continue to work with our suppliers, which are the primary gating factors really, I mean, there is nothing inside our facility that keeps us from producing more aircraft. As we tried to explain over the call... during the call, in our conversation before we did the Q&A. We've looked at about every possible way you can stress the backlog, you can create whatever economic situations you want in the U.S. or outside the U.S. and our take on seeing increased production in '09, '10 and '11 is very solid. Second, on next year, there is not very much going to get in our way on that number... I mean I... right now we don't see anything that's a bottleneck or a gating factor or I would be disappointed if we don't beat that a few... but we\u2019ll have to see about that.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Our customers would love us to get a few more than that and we are\u2026", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Right.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We're working hard for them to try to do it, but we have to rely on what commitments we can get out of our supply chain partners.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, guys.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Shannon.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers", "One follow-up on the Cessna production, I mean, Lewis, your comments about the expected pace of orders and obviously at some point to have to moderate from the pace they have been at. But it sounded like, you were viewing that less as a impact of the global economic slowdown and more as a function of how little availability you actually have in the jets given your backlog, so, I guess I am a little surprised you wouldn't really be pushing even harder to take production rate up, if you actually think they are going to see an order impact from lack of availability?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Well, I think I've done this on a couple of calls, but it's been about a year since I have done it. So let me tell you how this number rolls up, because I have been here since 1992, so I have seen the planning process so to speak upfront and personal. We really don't set the total number of jets to produce, let's say, 530. We don't really set that number that way. We take a look at each individual model, we project a five-year run rate and then we look at at what point should we announce a block point change or a replacement model for that particular model. And some models run for 20 years and some run for 15 and some run for 10. I'm trying to think how long the Citation 10 has been running, but it's well over 10 for sure, and probably bordering on 15.", "So my point is that what 530 is, it's an accumulation of the volume... annual deliveries for each one of the individual models. And of course we do have pent-up demand, there's no doubt about that. And we're trying to predict as best we can how to have sustained increases in volume without up one year, down the next, up one year, down the next. And if you think about it, we've increased our annual production every year since 9/11 at a fairly specific and fairly constant rate. So, Shannon, I'll have to tell you I... could we make more? Yes, we probably could stress the system and make 560, well, we could. But then again, what that does is, then if we had to slow down, we have to lay people off and we have to move production around... sorry, employees around based on seniority.", "And so what we've developed is a model of production that I think is superior to anybody else in the industry. Our quality is fabulous, our customer satisfaction is super, our employee workforce is just in a great shape, more outlays, I just don't anticipate us going to 600 and back to 500 one year. I think we're going to keep the same balance and we're going to try to moderate the lead times in some of our models and we're going to do that the best we can. But again, staring at what some people think is an uncertain future to make a statement that we're in increased production in '09, '10 and '11, that's pretty damn solid statement. So... and our customers are happy with us too, so\u2026 as evidenced by the order intake we've been receiving. So I'll give you another whack at it if you want, but that's my view on it.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers", "Yeah. Now I just say with 3.5 times backlog as you were saying, it seems like there's some room to take it up unless... I mean, you mentioned it's illogical but it assumes the cancellations, I mean are you seeing anything on that front incrementally that keeps you cautious enough?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, yes. With everything that's been written about this time would be, real frankly, as everything has been written about the slowdown in business jets, the cycle is coming at us. We have had two, one, two cancellations and most of those have been discussed with customers too which said, can you do us a favor, these are not business failures, these are not guys who have gone bankrupt and that business has gone underwater, these are two good customers we decided to move some from year one to year two. And by the way had an effect of those because we have people ready to step up to take those jets. So, we really only have two this year-to-date, very low number.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "This is really more driven by making sure the overall supply chain works efficiently and that we can get commitments from our suppliers, as well as internally, we've broken most of the internal constraints. We still have some more capital to put in to get to the level that we think we're going to need to be at five years from now. But, in the next year it's really what do we think we can get committed from our suppliers, and safely and efficiently build, and when we try to stretch it a little too far we get all kinds of inefficiencies in our system.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And just one more follow-up on the quarterly guidance pattern here. I understand some of the points of first half versus second half things ramping, but I mean you do have... Bell then implied to go back up in margin sequentially in the fourth and same with Cessna, is there anything in the 3Q in particular that makes it fit all... even more in one quarter?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, there was some... they shipped some units in both cases a little bit in the second quarter that had previously been in the third quarter expectations, so there was a little bit of move there. But, let me step back and say... when you normalize our business, the percent of EPS we have forecasted in this third quarter as a percent of the full year is dead on our normal performance. And the third quarter is always the challenging quarter for our businesses and if you take over the last decade what is our normalized earnings in the third quarter as a percent of the year, we\u2019re right at it.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Nicole Parent from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Nicole M. Parent - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Good morning.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Nicole.", "Nicole M. Parent - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "I just\u2026 not to nitpick, but I just want to get a sense, when we look at the guidance by subsegment, obviously for the full year you got better results at Cessna, Bell, Defense and Intelligence, you have industrial and finance weaker. When I look at the corporate expense and the interest expense, it looks like in aggregate it\u2019s probably going to give you a dime higher relative to your forecast in the first quarter. So I'm just wondering how I should think about that? Is that just your best guess, should we expect that to move around or is there potential upside elsewhere or downside that we're not sure of elsewhere?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, let\u2019s do both of them. Interest expense, there's no doubt, we've got a little more cash in earlier in the year. We ended up in a better position at year-end last year and we've had a better performance earlier in the year than what we expected and rates are a little bit better on the CP side of things. So, that's real performance that's happening on the interest expense side. On the corporate expense numbers, unfortunately the way we have to account for our hedge of our stock price is all of the noise you are seeing. Our corporate expenses are highly predictable, they are highly stable quarter after quarter after quarter and all of that variability you see on the corporate line is offset dollar-for-dollar on the tax line with virtually no EPS impact. So, I apologize for the accounting rules because they sure do make it confusing and difficult for everyone, but there is really nothing on the corporate side that's running through and causing any kind of EPS noise, it just causes line item noise.", "Nicole M. Parent - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And I guess with respect to finance, I know we are going to get more in the August 6 call, but could you give us a sense what each of the subsegments did, you have the 10-Q from Finance yet just to give us a better sense of where we saw, I mean, did distribution finance have a loss in the quarter, did golf finance have a loss, that type of stuff?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have the final details for the queue level, we may be able to get it if you give us a second. But clearly, distribution finance and golf finance were the two that had the most difficulties. We have businesses like resorts and aviation that are ahead of plan and doing very, very well. But the big hits were in those two businesses, distribution finance on kind of a homogenous business basis because we did see higher levels of chargeoffs and issues arise late in the quarter that are consumer durable-related in markets and that's across a broad range of businesses where the golf business was all the single hit. The bottom line, yes, distribution finance lost $3 million and golf lost $7 million.", "Nicole M. Parent - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And just one last one, as we think about margins, I mean, I always kind of look at that cost performance number that you guys give on the cargo analysis, and it looks like it was certainly an acceleration from the first quarter as we think about kind of lean implementation and Six Sigma, maybe Lewis, give us your sense of where you think the company is in terms of just how much upside is left when you think about the cost performance?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we had more upside than we have seen so far, really we've had a lot of big meetings this first quarter trying to take a look at the progress we've made, and where we can improve and what areas we ought to tackle next, and have been meeting with over 200 some folks and attendants discussing that topic. And I would expect that we have, like I said, more to be gained than we picked up. What happens in the factories and in the offices is, you gain momentum by having a few successes and a few more and a few more, and then pretty soon it's kind of just becomes a natural part of the DNA and that's what\u2019s starting to take place. So, Nicole, I expect us to continue to make big gains in productivity improvement, whether it's processing an invoice or producing a business jet for the next decade really. And I'm excited about it.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I'd just add. In spite of what looked like very good numbers there on cost performance over many, many quarters here, that number often includes a lot of investments that we've been making in the future. So it's held back to some extent.", "Nicole M. Parent - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Super. Thank you.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Robert Vallard from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Excuse me, Robert Stallard, I apologize.", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "That's all right. Thank you very much. Good morning everyone.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Rob.", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "I first got a couple of questions actually about Cessna. Lewis, you might be the best person for it. I was wondering if you could comment on how U.S. demand has tracked year-to-date for new orders and how you expect that to progress in the second half?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, well the U.S. demand is tracking about where we expected and the forward forecast for U.S. demand stays strong. International demand is stronger than we would have predicted last year, although we kind of caught up with our forecast early in the year and saw what was happening internationally. But, the mix is pretty solid internationally, in fact more solid than I think anyone predicted. We're seeing some, I'm going to say probably 70% of the current order book.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Year-to-date.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Year-to-date, being international and about 27% being domestic, which is really how we like to see it right now. And we've got pretty good distribution across Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, just a good balance. So actually our order mix is flowing just about exactly as we thought it would. So that's a positive story from my standpoint.", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "And if we look at some of the traditional lead indicators of where the U.S. market is going, what are you seeing on things like usage, second hand availability and pricing?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, pricing has been fine except, if you think about it, we're three, we're out two or three years on delivery, so anything you do on price now affects something delivered in 2010 so pricing is whatever it is. As far as use is concerned, it\u2019s, I'd say, pretty normalized. I think it's around between 11% and 12% now, which is kind of where we like to see it. We have seen no observable deterioration in any of our prospective customers' financial situation, and that's good, no major softness in tractional, as I said, order cancellation is only two. Our sales force has come back and said that they think our order rate for this year should exceed 570, that's not a forced number, that's an up from the grass roots number, kind of. So, and you\u2019re not seeing any big competitor looming up over us going to take our share away. So I think the concern over Cessna's future health is\u2026 anyone that has a concern like that has probably misplaced. As far as we can see, every factor we look at is at least neutral if not positive.", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "And just finally, if you were to look at the last downturn, you mentioned that there were some cancellations last time around. What sort of percentage was the backlog do you think is potentially at risk in a worst-case scenario?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Would you say that last sentence again, I missed it, did you say what percentage of backlog?", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "Yeah. With this what percentage of the backlog do you think this is potentially at risk [inaudible]?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Last time, we saw two years in a row with about 10% of beginning backlog cancelled within each of those years. But again the bigger impact was order intake falloff rather than cancellations. But that's what happened the last time and that was the worst down cycle that we've seen in general aviation for as long we've been watching them.", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "That's great. Thank you very much.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Bob, just to clarify, on that basis, in the last down cycle, over a period of three years we had a total of 170 orders cancelled and we expect something less than that will occur over the next three years and two months\u2026 or two quarters into it, we've got two. So I'd say we're tracking pretty well so far.", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Thanks.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey David.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Obviously new order activity at Cessna is still very strong. What about your service business? What did it look like in the quarter and what are you thinking for that business moving forward?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You mean Cessna service?", "David Strauss - UBS", "Yeah, Cessna service.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it continues to increase year-over-year as far our revenues and also profits. We have not seen the slowness that some of the commercial aftermarket people have been talking about though. And I would even circle back to the question that Rob asked, because in his question he included usage, and while usage on business jets on a per jet basis is down slightly, we've never seen a correlation between usage and the jet cycles. In fact in the last cycle, usage went up because usually when people have the jet they use it and they may choose to defer or not fly as many discretionary trips, but it hasn't provided a real meaningful look.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Service business was up 19.2% versus prior year in the quarter.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Okay. Great. And then you talked about you haven't seen really any cancellations, but are you seeing any more delivery slots being put up for sale in the market?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. That's not permitted at Cessna.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we haven't really...", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Our customers are not allowed to sell a slot.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Occasionally, one will sneak through on us and I mean, one out of 570 orders. So, it's kind of a small number, but that's really an anomaly because we don't allow it.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have a pretty darn good due diligence process on anybody that places an order. We just don't take the order and say, thank you very much. We know every one of our customers, we know what they're\u2026 why they're buying the plane, we know what they're selling, we know a lot about our customer base.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Yes. And one last one. Do you, Ted, do you know what the total loan loss provision was in the quarter and at TFC and the total charge-offs. And then, what you're\u2026 what\u2019s basically baked into your $130 million forecast for the rest of the year?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the total provision in the second quarter was 40 against charge-offs of 19. So we built reserves of 21. The year-to-date provision is 67 against charge-offs of 30. So, we built 37 of reserves year-to-date. Our expectation is a charge-off\u2026 is a provision number for the full year somewhere in the 110 to 120 kind of range. I don't have\u2026 I have a full-year charge-off rate, but I don't have a full-year charge-off dollar. We'll see if we can find that for you.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Okay, or the rate would be fine.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "The full-year rate we think is going to go to about 50 basis points. That's up from about an unbelievable 25 over the last couple of years.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Harry Nourse from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Harry Nourse - Bank of America", "Good morning.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Harry Nourse - Bank of America", "I was wondering whether you could just quickly get into about Defense and Intelligence. If you had $8 million of benefit... I mean, if your margin was just north of 11% in the quarter, it\u2019s going to go down to about 9.5% for the rest of the year. Can you just explain a bit further why it\u2019s going to go down?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. I'm not sure I can right now.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think the $8 million was just the ASV. There were...", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "There were some other program investments.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Investments at AAI [inaudible].", "Harry Nourse - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And the... and we just reduced expectations, as you roll the pricing forward on the basis of your past performance, then you have a lower target margin in the program going forward.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Right.", "Harry Nourse - Bank of America", "Okay. And on Industrial, can you just give a bit more detail on the cost grade, perhaps give an idea of how much of your operating costs oil now takes up?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I've got\u2026 I know the year-over-year impacts. I don't know too specifically. Let's just see, this is not Industrial either, this is everyone.", "Harry Nourse - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "All the major commodities across the Industrial businesses are up, forecasted to be about an $80 million increase this year. And of course we are out trying to price through as much of that as we can, and some of our businesses are fairly successful in doing it. Our most challenged in doing it in the short-term is Kautex, where resin prices have been significant, with probably total company hit on resin costs this year is over $30 million. And in the year, we're not going to get... we'll get half or better of that back, but we're not going to get much more than that back in the year. We are working hard to renegotiate our commercial contracts to put more and more passthrough clauses in, so that we can have a more immediate adjustment to those kind of costs. But, in the short-term, we don't have that.", "Harry Nourse - Bank of America", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And next we go on to the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co., LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. Your guidance for this year implies that the margins pop up in the fourth quarter at Cessna, and yet your delivery plans for next year, if we kind of back out the Mustang where at one point you talked about going from 100 to 150, really only implies a 4% increase in Citation jets. Is that conservative or is the idea that you'll get the big uptick in the Mustang and much less growth in the Citations?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think that's a problem of being too literal. We are going to do about 100 Mustangs this year, and about 150 next year. But, it's not necessary, you can't just simply take that as a guarantee, there is going to be a 50 increase. Maybe a little different number than that. But, I think it's, as Lewis said, we are going to do what we can to try to get a few more units out. I think that's a solid number. We feel very comfortable. We have all of our supply base lined up to deliver that number for next year. But, we have customers that would like us to do more, and if we can we'll try to get a few more out. But it's not going to be a material difference.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co., LLC", "Okay. And then you...", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, let me just follow up on that, Cai, I mean, again going back to Lewis's comments about, you have to look at the planning process and it's not like, okay, let's decide how many jets we are going to ship next year? In a large way, that decision was made a year or more ago. Two, three years ago, in some cases with respect to your supply chain. So, what has happened is that as we've seen orders come from the international markets as this S curve adoption has come along, we have raised considerably our outlook for world shipments on a systemic basis. And so, basically capacity now has to catch up with that, that new view where we are heading to over the next five years to a 700 level. So, we are very capacity constraint relative to the supply chain and we could get a couple of more out of there maybe but it... I would not characterize our view of next year as a conservative view, it's really what we think we can do.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And where you can assume we are already executing, we are two years into what will probably now be a seven-year plan to put capacity up at Cessna. And those plans are set in place and discussed with all of the supply chain to get everyone on board and it's not something we can jerk round by 20 airplanes in one year because there is a stronger backlog.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co., LLC", "Could you follow up, I thought you're basically saying the upper end still looks good, which seems to be the trends we are seeing in the biz jet market particularly if your international business is strong I would assume that would say the upper end of your product line and obviously the Mustang too would be where you are seeing the strength, can you give us any color just generally about the upper versus the lower end of the line in terms of order strength?", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's pretty balanced. It's amazingly balanced. Actually, I'm trying to think there are not many models you can get in 2010 actually.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's age of model rather than sign. Probably the most available aircraft we have is the [inaudible] Plus and it's one of our longest in the two aircrafts. So, it's more a function of how recently we have developed the product versus high-end, low-end. The Mustangs are selling like crazy.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co., LLC", "Okay terrific. Thank you very much.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Ron Epstein from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Ron.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Hi guys. A quick question for you. At Bell, on the commercial side, you guys discussed what kind of pricing increases you've seen over the past couple of years?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We've, well the last\u2026 the couple of years has probably been close to double-digits two years ago, and then it was moderated. This last year down to kind of mid single-digits, but it's been very strong we kind of took one-step function up. I want to say almost 24 months ago, maybe off by a quarter or two, we took a pretty big step function increase when the demand really started to build up out there. And last year, we didn't need to do quite as much, but I think it was still somewhere between 4% and 5%. I mean, the interesting thing now is that we have backlog in the commercial helicopter business that we've never had before in this business. So we've got\u2026 of our four major models and we are now reconfiguring and we are discontinuing a few models to focus on the long 206, the 407, the 412 and the 429. Other than the 412, which has some near-term availability, the 206 and the 407 are out to 2010. And obviously the 429, which hasn\u2019t launched yet is booked out to 2014.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. And then another quick question, I think you mentioned the flight hours flown for business aviation year-to-date, do you guys have an idea of where that's gone?", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, total flight hours flown is up, but flight hours on a same ship basis is off just a touch. In fact, until about last month, for about six months in a row, we were seeing utilization rates. So that's an existing aircraft flying extra number of hours this year versus last year, down just this close, which we think is somewhat fuel price related, but that number has been overwhelmed by the fleet size growth in the one year or so, obviously it's not a very big number. So, total flight hours is up, flight hours on a per ship basis is just marginally down.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I think where most of that decrease in utilization per ship is coming in the fractional segment of the market, where people who in the past have a tendency to fly more hours than they purchased are kind of economizing to stick within their hours but they are the ones to see the fuel surcharge right on the invoice\u2026", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Whereas most of our customers don't see that quite so obviously.", "Ronald J. Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "All right. Great. Super, guys. Thank you.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Leah, do we have any more questions in queue?", "Operator", "No, we do not.", "Lewis B. Campbell - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Great then, thanks everybody for joining us and have a good day. I hope to talk with you on 26th.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you all.", "Ted R. French - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Take care.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for digitized replay after 11 A.M.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. ", "I will now like to turn the conference over to Doug Wilburne, Vice President for Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Joining us today are Lewis Campbell, Textron's Chief Executive Officer; Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer and Ted French, Textron's Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I would like to mention our discussion today, we will include remarks about future estimates and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our annual SEC fillings and also in today's press release.", "You can also find a slide deck containing key data items from today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website. And we will be specifically referring to a couple of these charts today during our discussion.", "And then one final point is when we get to Q&A, we would like to ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question with possible follow-up. So that we can get through everybody, we would appreciate that.", "So, now moving to fourth quarter results, revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion up slightly from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations excluding special charges was $0.40 per share consistent with our revised guidance of $0.30 to $0.40 per share offered in our December 22, press release. ", "Special items in the quarter included the following, a $293 million pre-tax or $0.86 per share mark-to-market adjustment against assets held for sale at TFC in conjunction with our exit plan announced on December the 22. A $169 million pre-tax charge or $0.67 per share to eliminate TFC\u2019s goodwill, a $31 million tax charge or $0.13 per share, related to the change in investment status of TFC\u2019s Canadian subsidiary and $64 million pre-tax charge or $0.18 per share for restructuring charges across the enterprise. ", "Also we close on the sale of our Fluid & Power business and recorded an after-tax gain of $111 million which is reflected in discontinued operations. A reconciliation of our reported GAAP loss of $0.87 is attached to our press release. For the full-year our manufacturing businesses generated $899 million in cash against capital expenditures of $542 million. ", "Textron received $142 million and dividends during the year from TFC and in December we made $625 million capital contribution into Textron financial to maintain the earnings to fixed charge coverage ratio under the support agreement between Textron and TFC.", "Keep in mind that the contribution did not resolve and an increased to the total combined debt of Textron and Textron\u2019s financial as the increase in debt outstanding of Textron was exactly offset by the lower debt outstanding at TFC.", "With that I will turn the call over to Lewis.  ", "Lewis Campbell", "", "Thank you, Doug, and good morning everyone, let me set the stage for my remarks this morning by first pointing out the obvious economic conditions weaken further during the fourth quarter, but actually had a pace and degree that has not occurred in decades. The impact on our customers at Cessna Industrial and Textron Financial were particularly significant. Consequently as many of you have already observed, we believe 2009 is setting up to be the most challenging year ever for most manufacturing companies.", "Furthermore, Textron, we have an obvious additional challenge related to our commercial finance business and we are addressing that. That being said we have developed plans for 2009 that\u2019s squarely focus on two important goals. Improving cash generation and operating performance at each of our businesses and a markedly slower demand environment. And aggressively converting finance receivables at TFC to cash.", "Frankly, we are taking a very pragmatic approach to every aspect of the business given this unprecedented economic environment. And we have implemented a very comprehensive liquidity plan for the company we will talk about that. And a cornerstone of this plan is the expanded TFC exit strategy announced on December 22nd, which calls for a liquidation of at least $2.6 billion in receivables by the end of this year. We have a detailed execution plan for achieving this liquidation target and Ted will describe this in more detail very fully later. ", "In addition to the portfolio run-off, we are also pursuing significant asset sales of individual TFC business. A variety of potential buyers are currently looking at various portions and combinations of TFC, TFC\u2019s assets and we are working these possibilities vigorously. ", "We are also working on new securitizations. Our facility extensions similar to what we did last month, when we extended the maturity on a $550 million aircraft facility for about a year. At the Textron level, we expect positive cash generation from our manufacturing businesses plus we are evaluating a full range of potential capital markets alternatives as well as other asset sales. ", "Our recent successful closing of the Fluid and Power transaction which Doug mentioned is indicative of the kind of interest that exist even in these times from strategic buyers. To close this discussion, we believe that successful execution of our TFC exit plan combined with our other liquidity actions will raise cash efficient to meet or exceed our needs. You also know that we have a very strong leadership team on the field. The addition of Scott Donnelly to our team last year has proven to be very beneficial. And now, as our new President and Chief Operating Officer, he and I are keenly focused on running the business consistent with the quickly changing demand environment in which we find ourselves. ", "After I wrap up, Scott is with us this morning to provide some additional detail on the actions we are taking in our manufacturing businesses. ", "So, now let\u2019s move to the specifics beginning with Cessna where we delivered 131 jets in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year 2008 deliveries to 467 units. That\u2019s actually a new record for the both quarter and the year. Unfortunately, the economy is having an especially aggressive impact on the business jet industry including Cessna. ", "In the quarter, we only recorded 30 gross orders with about a 45/55 split by the way between the United States and International. In that same quarter, we also saw 23 cancellations and an unprecedented number of deferrals. Combined, these developments affected deliveries in the quarter and more significantly they will impact planned deliveries for 2009. Needless to say it is extremely difficult to forecast this year\u2019s delivery number because ultimately they will depend on how the economy and other factors effect customer orders and cancellations. ", "So, we are now basing our Cessna operating and production plan on expected delivery level of around 375 units for 2009. ", "To put our expected '09 Cessna plan in the historic perspective, remember that our previous big deliveries occurred back in '01 and in the '02 timeframe, I believe, with just over 300 jets and Cessna\u2019s revenues then were about $3 billion. At a delivery level of about 375 jets for 2009, Cessna\u2019s receivables will be $4.6 billion significantly higher. Coupled with the actions we are taking, we expect Cessna should have solid double-digit financial performance even while preserving critical components of R&D in '09. While Cessna is clearly a cyclical business, it does remain a premier franchise in what we believe an attractive yielded the young industry with a slight long-term growth as well.", " ", "Moving now to Industrial. The slowing economy had significant impact in the quarter on volumes in each of our businesses there. But, the largest decline came at Caltex where volumes were down 20% reflecting automotive OEM shutdowns literally around the world. Looking forward in 2009, we believe volumes across all of the Industrial will be down to about 20% to 25% on an average with the largest decline happening in the first quarter as our customers adjust their inventories and production to a lower demand. ", "On the other hand, a bright note inside Industrial\u2019s '08 performance relates to the importance of pushing the R&D and consequently new products. Our RXV golf car and E-Z-GO introduced at the beginning of the year made up nearly 60% of '08 deliveries, contributed to a 13.5% and E-ZO-GO revenues last year in spite of the slowing economy. ", "Now, let\u2019s shift to Textron Systems, where we were providing our US government customer essential capabilities critical in today\u2019s conflict scenarios that keep America\u2019s soldiers out of harms away. And the effectiveness of our products is beginning to attract business from foreign military sources as well. In particular, we are now selling our Sensor Fuzed Weapon product in United Arab Emirates and we are working a contract with another international customer as we speak. ", "Our ASV is now being deployed in a number of countries for their internal security missions. In fact, we expect to generate over $1 billion in foreign orders for a variety to Textron Systems products during 2009. Now that\u2019s literally five times what we generated last year. These should begin to contribute to growth in 2010 and beyond. ", "Furthermore, we were recently awarded a contract to operate a performance based logistic program for in country operation of AAI\u2019s shadow system in Iraq. On this basis we anticipate solid growth over the next several years at systems as US and international military interest in our products is expected to be relatively unaffected by the economy. We also are pleased with the execution and operating performance in systems. Given the amount of acquisition, integration activity that we had underway over the past two years there results there are even more impressive. ", "Okay to complete my discussion today, let's now move to Bell where execution is also a good new story and we made substantial progress over the past two years. I mean the V22 is probably the best example. ", "Last year we delivered 18 aircraft each ahead of schedule, actually most were one month ahead of schedule. In the fourth quarter, Bell added another $1 billion in the backlog of V22 reflecting next years funding of our multi-year contract which was approved last March. ", "On the operational side the V22 has performed extremely well in Iraq. Most recently this CV-22 which is the air force special version of the Osprey, recently self deployed with area refueling and 5000 nautical miles for a joint multinational operations involving special forces. Feedback from the customer already on this unique capability is that the CV-22 exhibited superb performance during the mission.", "Likewise, earlier this month the first detachment of H1 Yankee utility units have gone into service as they set sale aboard the USS Boxer with US Marine Corp 13 marine expeditionary unit. We delivered 12 H1 units last year, which included an early delivery from 2009 again we are ahead of schedule and we continue to improve factory productivity. ", "Execution on the commercial side of our business also showed improvement last year, we delivered 167 commercial helicopters versus our beginning of year target of 160. On the demand front our US military business should experience significant growth over the next several years as we ramp the V22 and H1 programs and as we service and reset legacy aircraft that have seen heavy in theatre use. ", "On a commercial side of Bell, we actually saw a few cancellations and deferrals during the first quarter but nothing really severe. Nevertheless, we are going to take a cautious approach to commercial production for '09 with an expectation about 180 deliveries versus the 169 in '08. We obviously will watch this very carefully through the year. ", "So in conclusion, the economic environment has changed quickly and we are taking serious actions accordingly. We have three premier businesses in Cessna, Bell and Textron systems, which combined should generate 80% of our revenues this year at double-digit margins with strong cash flow even in the midst of this economic dislocation. ", "Our priorities this year are crystal clear, maximize cash flow and operating performance in our manufacturing businesses and convert finance receivables to cash at TFC. We believe we have a plan by which we can successfully navigate these difficult times and we are committed to execute that plan. We believe that we will emerge leaner and more focused and looking forward we fully expect that growth in our strong defense businesses will sustain us over the next several years and after the world economies recover this will be augmented by expansion at Cessna as well as within the remainder of our commercial businesses. ", "With that I will turn it over to Scott. Scott?", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank you, Lewis. Good morning everyone. Clearly our focus this year the manufacturing businesses to maximize cash flow of our operations while at the same time preserving the critical part development efforts that will support our future growth when we come out of this economy. ", "Accordingly we are aligning our '09 production to match expected lower commercial demand lowering our selling, general and administrative cost to headcount reductions, curtailing most discretionary spending includes some reductions in product development, freezing salaries across the company, aggressively reducing our working capital and eliminating non-essential capital spending. Specifically, we dramatically reduced our production plans in Cessna Industrial and to a lesser extent at Bell Commercial to ensure we reflect our current view of customer band to minimize our finished goods inventory. ", "Correspondingly today we announced an additional 2000 headcount reduction at Cessna, consistent with our reduced production level of about 375 jets.", "Overall, we're targeting a 10% reduction in SG&A expense which is worth about $150 million in cost savings. With respect to R&D where we're originally planning an increase of nearly 10%, we are now committed to reduce net R&D spending by about 8% or $45 million less than 2008.", "Looking at our working capital, primary source of cash opportunity here is our inventories which last year were $3.1 billion. We are working across all of our inventories and all of our operations to reduce that number by 15%, leveraging our lean activities deeper into our manufacturing processes and by resetting our supplier delivery schedules to align with our reduced order requirements.", "To finish with CapEx we are planning to reduce our spending to about $315 million this year that's down 42% from last year's $542 million again consistent with our reduced capacity requirements.", "In summary, we recognized our planning for reduced demand in our commercial businesses and we are taking appropriate actions to optimize our performance due to this down cycle. And our defense operations where demand remained strong, we're committed to efficiently building the foundation for growth as in our plan over the next few years.", "With that I will turn it over to, Ted", "Ted French", "", "Thank you, Scott. Good morning everyone. Let me start with the discussion of the TFC exit strategy and then our overall liquidity plan. The exit strategy consists of two elements, liquidation of TFC's non-captive finance receivables and the sale of assets. We've developed comprehensive bottoms up account-by-account liquidation plan that targets a 2009 receivables reduction of $2.6 billion.", "Notifications were issued late last year, informing our customers of our intentions to terminate financing as soon as contractually permissible and advising them to seek alternate funding.", "We are monitoring progress against weekly targets to ensure that we need our reduction goal.", "Despite a minimum 90 day window from most contract terminations to become effective we do expect to achieve over $400 million in liquidations in Q1. We're only a few weeks into our plan, but we are having early success and tracking slightly ahead of target. As we passed the minimum notification period in the second quarter we expect a significant acceleration and liquidation has been.", "In some cases we're able to assist groups of our customers and locating alternative financing. For example late last year we completed a customer transfer agreement with another inventory financing company.", "Under the agreement this company will assume new funding requirements for approval of our consumer electronics and appliance for planned customers. We are pursuing similar transfer arrangements for as much of our distribution finance portfolio as possible. ", "The second part of our exit strategy involved sales of TFC assets, and in that regard we've designated $2.9 billion of our managed receivables as now being held for sales.", "Based on the number of interested parties currently performing reviews, we believe we may be able to complete a number of meaningful transactions this year thereby augmenting the liquidation process.", "Now, let's talk about the how the exit strategy fits in with our overall liquidity plan.", "First, between Textron and TFC we continue to have daily access to the commercial paper markets, although, some days have been more difficult. TFC is using small amounts of its bank lines to supplement its CP program and currently has about $200 million outstanding. But clearly our committed credit lines are working just as they were designed to work.", "By the way we typically see our heaviest issuance of commercial paper in the first quarter. As our manufacturing business is usually experienced a decrease in sequential deliveries.", "Out of our $2.6 billion and expected '09 liquidations. Between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of that we will go to payoff bond holders of our securitization vehicles. That leaves an available balance of between $600 million and $1.1 billion for TFC to meet $1.6 billion of term maturities in 2009.", "Our plan to address that short fall is as follows. We are pursuing a wide variety of sources to not only cover the '09 maturities but also to reduce our overall reliance on commercial paper. So we are driving to bring the balance down.", "We're looking to generate between $1 billion and $2 billion of cash through the combination of asset sales at TFC as we discussed, new securitizations or extensions similar to what we just did with our aircraft facility in December and other potential asset sales at Textron.", "We're also expecting to generate about $400 million in cash from our manufacturing businesses after CapEx, and as Scott discussed, we're looking to bolster that through various operating initiatives.", "We continue to closely monitor the corporate bond markets and as soon as practical, we'll access term capital to pay down commercial paper.", "And finally, as the ultimate backstop, we have our $3 billion in committed credit facilities. So, we have a comprehensive plan by which we expect to meet our funding needs.", "Now, let's turn our attention back to fourth quarter results.", "Looking at what drove the year-over-year changes, income from continuing operations, excluding special charges of $0.40, was down $0.57 from a year ago. $0.46 of the decline came from TFC, the details of which I'll go through shortly. On the manufacturing side, higher pricing of about 3% added $0.26 a share. However, this was offset by about 3.7% inflation, which cost about $0.30 a share.", "Cost performance benefited the quarter by $0.12 and taxes provided a positive dine, primarily as a result of the foreign tax credit benefit from the repatriation of foreign cash during the quarter, which we discussed in our December 22 release.", "Lower volume and unfavorable mix cost us $0.16, headwinds from engineering research, development and depreciation cost $0.12, and a variety of miscellaneous items were a penny.", "Now, let's move to our segment discussion and we'll start with Cessna.", "Despite the late year fall-off in demand, the fourth quarter was a capstone or a record year at Cessna in terms of jets delivered and revenue and profit generated. However, Cessna's fourth quarter revenues and segment profit did decrease $64 million and $90 million respectively.", "Revenues were down and in spite of higher jet units that primarily reflected a higher mix of Mustangs. This was partially offset by higher pricing and a benefit from the Colombia product line acquisition.", "Segment profit decreased due to used aircraft and mark-to-market adjustments. The impact from lower revenue mix and higher product development and overhead cost. Cessna's backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $14.5 billion, up $1.9 billion from the end of last year.", "Looking to '09, based on revenues of about $4.6 billion, which would be associated with 375 jets, we estimate that we would be able to give full year margins in the 10% to 12% range.", "However, the first quarter is going to be our most difficult at Cessna, as we anticipate less than 80 deliveries due to the inability to efficiently replace lost deliveries that affected the quarter. They should stabilize somewhat in the second quarter as we rearrange customer slots and cost savings from our downsizing action take hold.", "Moving to Bell now, revenues and profits increased $98 million and $40 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in revenues was due to higher volume and pricing. The increase volume relates to higher V-22 and spares and service revenues, partially offset by a lower commercial helicopter mix and the absence of ARH program revenue.", "Segment profit increased due to favorable cost performance, higher volume and pricing in excess of inflation, partially offset by unfavorable mix. The cost performance reflects the non-recurrence of program charges recorded in the fourth quarter of '07, in both military and commercial programs and higher royalty income this quarter.", "Bell backlog at the end of Q4 was $6.2 billion, up $2.4 billion from the end of last year. Looking to '09, we believe revenues and segment profits would be approximately flat with 2008.", "Sales for the year reflect a decrease in military revenue, primarily due to the absence of ARH development activities, lower V-22 spares and support and the temporary reduction in H-1 production which will ramp backup starting in 2010. Again, the first quarter is our lowest delivery quarter and we expect first quarter revenues and profits to be about the same as last year's first quarter.", "Now looking at Textron Systems, revenues and segment profit increased to $180 million and $37 million respectively. The increase in revenues is due to the benefit of our acquired AAI business and higher volume for ASV spares and logistics, intelligent battle field systems and Sensor Fuzed Weapon. Segment profit increased due to the favorable cost performance, higher volume and the benefit from the acquisition.", "Backlog at systems ended the year at $2.5 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of last year. This backlog should help drive an increase in revenues in '09 to just under $2.3 billion. We expect full year profits to be slightly down as last year's favorable cost performance on a number of completed government contracts gets reflected in this years new lot pricing. And they\u2019ll have a fairly even distribution of our earnings across the borders.", "Next we have Industrial where revenues and segment profit decreased to $135 million and $59 million respectively. Revenues decreased due to lower volumes and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by higher pricing and the favorable impact of the Paladin Tools acquisition at Greenlee.", "Segment profit decreased due to the impact of the lower volume in mix, inflation in excess of higher pricing and the unfavorable foreign exchange impact.", "As Louis, mentioned we expect volumes in revenues will likely be down 20% to 25% this year with the largest decline occurring in Q1 at these volumes and with our cost actions we expect to achieve slightly positive full year segment profits in 2009 with a first quarter loss approximately equal to the fourth quarter of '08.", "Now finishing with finance, credit performance continued to deteriorate with 60 day delinquencies increasing to 2.59% of finance receivables up from 1.06% at the end of the third quarter. Non-performing assets increased to 4.72% from the third quarter level of 2.67.", "Against this backdrop revenues decreased $64 million in the fourth quarter due to lower market interest rates and lower securitization gains which were partially offset by the benefit of interest rate floors.", "Segment profit decreased to $171 million as a result of increased loan loss provisions, higher borrowing cost and lower securitization gains again partly offset by the interest rate force.", "We recorded a $133 million in loan loss provisions to reflect general weakening in market conditions, declining collateral values and the lack of liquidity available to our borrowers and their customers.", "This also incorporates our increased estimates of future losses as we believe that our exit plan will negatively impact credit losses over the duration of our portfolio.", "After $33 million in charge-off during the quarter our loan loss reserves rose to a $191 million or 2.8% of our current $6.9 billion worth of owned receivables held for investment. Managed receivables ended the year at $10.8 billion versus $11.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.", "Looking to '09 on the performance side of TFC, we are planning for credit losses that range from 2 to 4 times higher than in previous down cycles.", "In that context we expect the TFC segment loss in the range of a $150 million to a $175 million this year. We expect to make additional capital contributions to TFC this year but we also plan to have TFC dividend cash back as we liquidate the portfolio.", "In total, we expect TFC to flow about $50 million net back to Textron after capital contributions.", "In conclusion we are projecting full year earnings across year from continuing operations and before special items. We'll be in the range of a $1 to a $1.50 given first quarter volume considerations and the fact that many of our cost initiatives do not take full effect until the second quarter.", "We're expecting only modest profits before restructuring charges in Q1. We're managing through this global economic reality with swiftness and intensity, bringing into bare the resources in the enterprise, the strength of our diverse business base and our commitment to take a hard line and stream lining operations.", "We look forward to keeping you informed about our progress as we move though the year and with that operator we are ready to open up to call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And at this time we have a question from Nicole Parent, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning.", "Lewis Campbell", "Hey Nicole.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I guess first could we may be get a sense when we go back to the August, obviously the financial landscape has deteriorated rapidly for everybody but I guess in the context of the finance presentation that we got back in August, when we talked about the portfolio quality improving and kind of there was no way we were going to get back to the losses that we had, in the '02, '03 timeframe. At the end of the fourth quarter it looks like we wildly exceeded the charge-off ratio TMPA. When you think about passage for 2009 how much conservative put in to that forecast.", "Lewis Campbell", "Well, obviously Nicole the world did change in the fourth quarter in a big way for us and, we've taken substantial reserves in the quarter higher than what we had previously expected both as a combination of the changes in the world and the impact that its had on our borrowers and their customers. But also in the context of the fact that you know our business model largely blew up as a result of all of the changes that have happened with the financial crisis.", "And we have changed strategies to move ourselves back to captive position. And we believe that, that will result in further losses higher levels of losses because of that. I think we have been reasonable and may be reasonably conservative. We have put reserves up in Q4 at levels that are as I said, depending on business two to four times higher than what we incurred in the prior downturn. We also have significantly raised charge-off expectations in our numbers for next year. As well as assumptions that we'll have to continue to put up significant reserves.", "I just don't know where the economy is going to go from this point I think we're being conservative but time will tell.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Fair enough and just one follow-up on the cancellations and deferrals you are seeing 20% delivery forecast declined for 2009. Seems reasonable may be any read through that you can make on who is canceling who is deferring or is it. All customers all industry across the board?", "Scott Donnelly ", "Well, Nicole it seems to be across the board fairly, broadly mixed I mean, we still have a good mix of international. We haven't really seen any single pocket of cancellations that makes you think, there is some kind of a very serious targeted problem for us, and is basically what President Obama and the rest of the world is trying to figure out. How do you stimulate the economy and up for the people who are out and borrowing money at rates taken before to buy business jets and other items.", "So no I would say nothing noteworthy.", "Nicole Parent \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we have a question from, Jeff Sprague, Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Thank you. Just on TFC, Ted would you actually envision continuing to build your provision balance over the course of '09, you provision well in excess of charge-offs here in the quarter. But should we expect the balance to continue to increase over the course of '09?", "Ted French", "No, Jeff. I think we have substantial charge-offs that we expect in '09. We will continue to put up additional provisions as we go to the year but we expect charge-offs will be higher than provision. So that balance will come down as will the overall asset balance come down, we're targeting to be down to just over $8.5 billion of receivables by the end of the year.", "Scott Donnelly ", "Okay. Jeff, the mid point of our range assumes a mid point of charge-offs somewhere in the 3.5% area so that would not lead to an increase in reserves.", "Lewis Campbell", "Ideally we obviously put up the reserves first, the charge-offs following in subsequent periods. ", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "And, Ted you kind of walked us through the liquidity with some of the pluses and minuses we needed to think about but just to be specific, where are the CP balances today and what are the timing of the '09 term maturities?", "Ted French", "CP balances today are around $1.7 billion somewhere in that neighborhood I don't have it this morning.", "Lewis Campbell", "Just below, 1.8 yesterday.", "Ted French", "Just below 1.8 yesterday, the timing of maturities are pretty much backend loaded the TFC maturities are, in the $200 million to $300 million range for the first three quarters of the year. And then about $800 million in Q4 for a total 1.50 for the full year. ", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "And then if I might just change gears a little bit back to Cessna. ", "Lewis Campbell", "It will be a follow-up Jeff. ", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "I know, but that\u2019s the world we live in, isn\u2019t it?", "Lewis Campbell", "Yeah. ", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Nicole asked the question a little bit as related to Cessna, but what is the '09 production implied for Mustang and is there any particular distinction between our Mustang customers are acting and others certainly a couple of months they were looking more resilient and I wonder if that\u2019s changed?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, Jeff, I would say that, that still where we are. The number of enquires cancellation delays as we have gone through the Mustang backlog remains very firm. We have taken it down modestly from our original '09 plans but the reductions there are not as significant to some of the other larger effect. ", "Lewis Campbell", "We are looking at about hundred first.", "Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay, so you said a 130 Mustangs which would imply, I see you are up 30% there, is that correct? So, all of the decline is coming in the good stuff where you make a good margins?", "Scott Donnelly", "That\u2019s correct. The Mustang is still and is still under ramp up. ", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And could you give us some more color on which of the models that are having the greatest difficulty and why the first quarter from the kind of a disappointing fourth quarter is going to be 80? Is that sort of delays or is it execution. I guess, I didn\u2019t quite understand why the first quarter was going to be quite so low?", "Lewis Campbell", "Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well it\u2019s primarily a factor of the delays and cancellations that we saw when we went through the fourth quarter last year and went through and talked to all of our customers to backlog. So, those 80 units that we have forecast for Q1 delivery are all firm sold aircraft. ", "Lewis Campbell", "I think it\u2019s the speed in which the cancellation process and the late process happened in Q4, a lot of newer aircraft got cancelled and we are in a process right now of trying to reset the line, move customer slots around, move some customers up but there is not enough time to make a lot of that happen in Q1. ", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "So, do we assume that you took about 30-35 Mustangs in the first quarter. ", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it should be about that. Yeah it\u2019s a linear run rate and the run rate that we had going out of the year supported the original plan to be able to do about 150 a year. So, you would expect that Mustang delivered pretty lengthier linear across the year. ", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Thank you very much gentlemen. ", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay. ", "Operator", "And next we have a question from Noel Poponac, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi, good morning. ", "Lewis Campbell", "Hello.", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You talked about the CP being available but more difficult on some days. Can you give us kind of what the actual cost is on average and comment on whether not the recent rating agency downgrades have impacted your excess at all. ", "Ted French", "I\u2019ll start with the first, we have average 4.5% but that\u2019s very, we had got very expensive late December, we came back after the 1st of January, the cost plunged quite a bit and then I would say that as our ratings kind of reset here over the last few weeks, that have had some impact both on cost and quantity in the short-terms hopefully that\u2019s all settling back down now and we will have better position going forward. ", "Lewis Campbell", "And values by maturities, the overnight obviously is less expensively and that\u2019s like in the 3.5% range and stuff that we are getting out in the March is more little bit over a 5.5% range. ", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That makes sense. Quick follow-up the Textron System\u2019s guidance, it looks like it implies that the margin percentage is down about 100 basis points year-over-year even though your volume is increasing in the upper single digits. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes on that? ", "Ted French", "I think the big driver there is kind of a problem of great performance. During the course of 2008 we consistently over performed on a lot of our government contracts and continued to pick up big games on contract close outs and obviously as you see your actual performance and we negotiate new contracts which happens on pretty much on annual basis, with a lot of these businesses; you got to recent your margins back down into the more acceptable level for our customers. So, we really outperformed in '08 we expect to have good solid performance at traditional margins in '09 but just not repeating the over performance we had in '08. ", "Lewis Campbell", "Yes, one comment I would add there just quickly is that systems for, say a decade has been probably our most aggressive in employing lean tactics and just creating a improvement mentality and improvement mentality for the entire workforce, right from the engineers to the factory floor. And we have historically quoted fixed price contracts which can be risky in our case they have never been. And then we have historically found ways to beat those prices over the contract periods. So, you actually incur more profits than you estimated and that\u2019s what they have talked about, so I would expect that what you are looking at going forward to be conservative not aggressive ", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", " ", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Lewis Campbell", " ", "Yes.", "Operator", "", "And next we have a question from David Strauss with UBS. Please go ahead. ", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Lewis Campbell", " ", "Hi, David. ", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "The 375 delivered that you are forecasting for assessment, can you just give us an idea of coverage or you completely sold out on those given the deferrals, or do you still have it's tough to take some more it's actually hit that kind of number?", "Scott Donnelly", " ", "Right now where we are is little over 80% sold out. ", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "80%.", "Scott Donnelly", " ", "80%, little above 80%.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "And then the deferrals that you are seeing is it your customers moving out six months a year or they moving out beyond that kind of period pushing deliveries out of couple of years?", "Scott Donnelly", " ", "It varies a quite a bit, but I mean suffice obviously most of the folks that are '09, we are talking about deferrals that one we pushed '10 and they are looking at the economy, trying to understand where they will be. So I think that's sort of fluid when you look at deferral you negotiate with customers and we will continue to work with them and until they want commit from date. ", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And the interest expense forecast for the year, $180 million can you be maybe give us some color on what exactly is baked into that? ", "Ted French", " ", "We are assuming and that number that we will term out a sale, one of our strategies for taking the CP balance down so we have less reliance on that market will be to term out that and we have assumed that we will term it out at some fairly high prices. It maybe a conservative number but we wanted to have covered what might happen. ", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks guys. ", "Operator", "", "And next we have question from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Hi, good morning.", "Lewis Campbell", " ", "Hi, Steve. ", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "I have a quick question for you. Couple of weeks ago GE, Tyco couple of others took advantage of the small window in the bond market. Were you guys around for that, will you exploring doing a deal with that stage of the game, can you talk about whether you explored doing something in the market at that stage of the game? And I am also just curious everybody kind of beat up on GE when they look at their finance business and in August they did an equity offering and it's seems like they been actually ahead of the curve relative to you guys as far as taking down their exposure in financial service and I haven\u2019t seen any management changes here. So, I am just curious as to why we are continually, strategically behind the curve here, whether this is the function of you know what unprecedented environment, if you just comment on both of those items I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Lewis Campbell", " ", "I don\u2019t think we are behind the curve, I think we had a strategy to continue to refine and focus this business when the world was going through a more normal looking recession, but when we went into the September, October timeframe and had Lehman Brothers and other things happened it become apparent at that point in time that whole model or wholesale borrowing or kind of business was broken. ", "And we pretty quickly made a decision that we need to take more aggressive action to do that and obviously we have been working that for lot of that quarter and so we came public with it on the 22nd of December. So, I don\u2019t think we are behind the curve. Obviously, if we knew what we know today we would have starting doing this a long time ago. As to the capital markets I think you can safely assume that we are valuating a whole range of and have designed a whole range of possible directions that we have taken and when we think the markets are amenable to doing so we are ready to strike on moment to notice. ", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "", "And next we have a question from Matt Vitoriosa (ph) from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "[Matt Vitoriosa] \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good morning. I want to just get a little more clarity on liquidity for Textron Inc. specifically. And then more specifically looking at Q1, so if we take into account that the way you are talking about Q1 being probably the toughest quarter, on the Cessna side. So, I would think there is going to be some build up of inventory there which quickly to our cash outflow or free cash flow negative for Q1. So, if we think about the possibility of free cash flow negative for Q1 versus, having new contributive cash to Textron Finance, just could you lay out what your liquidity at Textron Inc is, which would tell us what your ability in Q1 to support Textron Finance?", "Lewis Campbell", "", "Yes. First of all, supporting Textron Finance largely happened in Q4, with the capital contribution to be made there. We will start during the course of '09, bringing some net balance back. We will have to make small capital contribution at the end of each quarter, but we will also be taking dividends back out of TFC as we liquidate the portfolio. So, it's our expectation that we will have a net flow back to Textron in '09. It will all depend on how well we execute the liquidation but based on our rundown $2.6 billion somewhere north of $50 million of net should back up to Textron if we are able to execute on any asset sales which we are working hard on during the course of the year. That number could be bigger. So, we don\u2019t expect a further slowdown. In fact with the 625 that went down, TFC's leverage are down to just over five to one. So, there is a lot of room to bring some of that money back up.", "We do have, always, first quarter is a challenging quarter, but incorporating all of our business plans for the operation to business, obviously, we are shutting up inventory flowing into the house on the manufacturing side as best we can. We think, we can still operate in Q1, our CP balances under the $2 billion, $2.1 billion kind of range. So, we are all comfortable with our credit lines.", "[Matt Vitoriosa] \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "What's today if you look at the credit line at Textron Inc.? It's, I think, the $1.25 billion credit line. What's the availability considering the CP balances and other borrowers?", "Ted French", "", "I think the piece of CP outstanding at Textron is 7 something. I don\u2019t know the exact number today. 700 or 800, somewhere in that range.", "[Matt Vitoriosa] \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay. Alright. Thank you guys.", "Lewis Campbell", "", "And again, though, just to make follow-up on that point, the entire $3 billion of our credit lines are available to TFC. There is a sub limit for Textron.", "[Matt Vitoriosa] \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). And at this time we have a question from Steve Searl, Conning Asset Management. Please go ahead.", "Steve Searl \u2013 Conning Asset Management", "", "Yes, can you just tell us what was TFC\u2019s total debt at the end of the year?", "Ted French", "", "About 7 billion.", "Steve Searl \u2013 Conning Asset Management", "And can you just talk about the pension plan, what impact that had on new shareholders equity and maybe funding needs for this year?", "Ted French", "", "The pension plan is most of pretty good last year. We did better than many but were down 20% or so. Actually the hit to equity is about $800 million, little under $800 million. EPS wise and yes I know others will be interested in that, I think we have a headwind of somewhere around $0.04 to $0.05 a share or higher pension cost in 2009 versus 2008. ", "And we have fairly minimal funding requirements in '09. We have our normal ongoing. We have a little bit of a DC plan that we pay cash into, we have some foreign plans that we put 15 million to 20 million of cash a year-end that\u2019s normal an ongoing. The Master Trust which is where the largest portion of pension assets are and where the decline occurred will put less than $10 million in '09. Depending on how the stock market performance in '09 we could have requirements to put significantly more cash into those plans by the September 2010 timeframe.

Please go ahead.", "", "Mike Meek \u2013 Atlantic Investments", "Hi, just want to make sure I understand your guidance at Cessna assumption.

You have got 80% of the projected deliveries in hand, so the assumption is, you will be able to move customers who are further out in the backlog up to take those slots.", " ", "Lewis Campbell", "Yeah there will be a combination, so if you look at the number of aircraft that are unsold in terms of '09 delivery slot, some of those quite possibly will come from customers that are in at later delivery dates and fair number right now or potentially new customers.

At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Doug Wilburne, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Kent, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to mention our discussion today will include remarks about future estimates and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC fillings and also in today's press release. You can also find a slide deck containing key data items for today's call in the Investor Relations section of our website. And we will be specifically referring to many of these charts during today's discussion.", "Finally, you can also find an excel download our income statements for the past five years recast to reflect the move of HR Textron to discontinued operations as a result of the sale of this business in the quarter.", "We will begin our call today, with a brief discussion of first quarter results, then Lewis Campbell, Textron's Chairman and CEO will follow with comments on our liquidity plan, the excellent progress we made in the first quarter and how today's public offerings support that plan. After that Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and Chief Operating Officer will review key operating items in each of our segments. We will wrap up with additional analysis of our first quarter results and a few comments about our outlook and we also have Dick Yates, our Acting Chief Financial Officer present to participate in Q&A as needed.", "Moving now to first quarter results. Revenues in the quarter were $2.5 billion down 24%. GAAP earnings were $0.35 per share, and adjusted earnings from continuing operations excluding restructuring charges were $0.26 per share compared to $0.88 a year ago. Our results included a $0.13 per share after-tax gain from the sale of CESCOM, our aircraft tracking service at Cessna. That\u2019s our air company and it's tracking service at Cessna.", "On a pre-tax basis, the gain was $50 million and was included in Cessna's first quarter segment profit of $90 million. On the cash front, we have adjusted our definition of free cash flow to enable a better understanding of cash generated by the manufacturing group separately from the cash generation of TFC. By the way Textron Corporate cash flows are included in the manufacturing group.", "Looking at page 3 then of our key data schedules titled manufacturing group cash flow, you see the manufacturing operations used $286 million in cash during the first quarter. It's important to note that this was favorable to plan as cost savings and cash conversion actions were taking have already began to take gain traction. Nonetheless, the manufacturing cash usage reflected a significant build of inventory at Cessna, as we delivered 69 jets versus our plan of about 80. As well as significant seasonal payments made across the company during the quarter, including about a $100 million in cash to settle our 2008 stock-based compensation hedge.", "Also keep in mind that the inventory build at Cessna which was about $250 million in the quarter should begin to reverse itself during the second half of the year as our production flows reach their new target levels. Scott will speak in more detail about the actions we have taken at Cessna to address the inventory build as it's been a key focus area for us.", "And one last item regarding accounting convention at TFC. We have decided to report non-accrual finance receivables separately from hard assets we own that were received in settlement of troubled finance receivables. This separate reporting reflects the increasing proportion of recovered assets and the difference in characteristics between owning part assets versus finance receivables.", "With that I will turn the call over to Lewis.", "Lewis Campbell", "Okay, thank you, Doug and good morning everyone. The industrial and financial sectors of the economy continued to be a challenge for us this quarter. And as a result most of the company's commercial markets experienced further softening and TFC credit quality weakened. On the other hand we had continued solid results at Bell and Textron Systems. And importantly we had strong execution on our liquidity plan.", "Specifically, we liquidated $926 million of managed receivables at TFC about twice of what our planned calls were. As you know we also completed the sale of HR Textron for net cash proceeds of about $275 million. And we took steps to right size our manufacturing businesses and improve working capital efficiency.", "As expected we used cash to support our manufacturing operations in the quarter but we did so at a pace less than what we have planned despite lower than anticipated volumes.", "Looking to the full-year we expect a significant contribution to cash generation from inventory reductions as the year progresses and we remain on-track to generate $400 million of manufacturing free cash flow for the full-year in 2009.", "To ensure our organizational focus on our cash objective, we have already incorporated a significant incentive compensation management element for our top 1000 managers directly linked to stretch cash generation goals.", "Okay, let's discuss our overall liquidity plan starting with a review of the planned objectives which we have listed on page 4 in our schedules. And it is going to be important to follow these schedules especially for page 4 and 5.", "Okay, we intend to complete our plan without selling any of our core assets including the captive finance business. In addition we looked to maintain a minimum cash balance of at least $1 billion to ensure operating flexibility. Over time, we look to restore efficient access to the unsecured debt markets. And finally, we are targeting to accumulate sufficient cash to pay off our bank loans and to be in a position to re negotiate those lines well in advance of the April 2012 maturity.", "Now to reach our planned objectives we have many different initiatives most of which were already executing. And there are others which are currently being pursued.", "Well that as a backdrop. Let's look at our updated base liquidity plan which is shown on page 5 of the schedule. So, I am going to spend some time on this. So turn to page 5.", "We have changed the format of the schedule somewhat from what you have seen previously. We started with a commercial paper balance we paid that off now. So we now show a starting unit as cash on the balance sheet show at the top of the page. Additionally, our forecast now reflects first quarter achievements as well as refined estimates of future cash flows. So, let me first look at the column for the first quarter.", "We begin the year with combined cash balance of $547 million shown at the top there. To that we added our managed receivables reduction of $925 million then we subtract the $286 million use of cash for manufacturing operations.", "On the funding side and as you know we drove on our bank loans for almost $3 billion and paid down commercial paper and term and securitization debt as shown on the chart.", "Any of you that saw our previous chart now that the dent payments were slightly more than what was originally and contractually required as we made some early retirements of debt. Continuing there is the $376 million in gross cash from the HRT sale. Keeping in mind this transaction should net about $275 million after we pay cash taxes later in the year you can see that on column 2 under the 2009 full-year.", "Then after dividends paid and other miscellaneous uses of cash and non-cash adjustments Textron and TFC ended the quarter with combined cash of $1.7 billion.", "Looking now to full-year. We are increasing our '09 forecast of TFC liquidations from our original $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion. And we are doing this while maintaining our original 2010 plan of $1.9 billion of liquidations. We have total debt payments of about $1.6 billion for bond owners and $2.3 billion for securitization investments. With our projection of cash for manufacturing still at $400 million we are now estimating an ending '09 cash balance of about $1.3 billion.", "And moving to 2010, our base plan now shows ending cash balance of about $700 million up from the previous plan of about $225 million. So, obviously we are pleased with our progress so far.", "And today as we announced last night we are taking advantage of favorable capital market conditions to raise capital to an offering of convertible senior notes and common stock. Net proceeds are expected to be approximately $470 million net of fees and those of course, depend on marketing conditions and our stock price. This will significantly increase our cash liquidity bringing us to an end of 2010 cash balance of nearly $1.2 billion almost a $1 billion improvement from our original forecast you can see that at the very bottom of page.", "The offering also has a benefit of strengthening and extending the maturity of our capital base. Operationally, we are focused on managing for a slower economy. For example, we expect the business jet order environment will take considerable time to recover. Accordingly, we have regionally reached the very difficult decision to suspend the Citation Columbus program. We are obviously disappointed that we will not be bringing this product to market in the timeframe originally planned, however, at this point of cycle it's more important for us to invest in our core, light and mid-sized product lines.", "On the other hand as I said earlier we are fortunate to have two very well positioned businesses, Bell and Textron Systems. Their solid growth outlooks are evident when looking at the 2010 DoD budget outlined recently released. And longer term with a ramp up of the V-22, the H-1, the Bell Commercial 429, Unmanned Aircraft Systems and host of other programs we expect solid growth from these two businesses for years to come. To wrap up our liquidity plan is working and we have been able to demonstrate progress on every front.", "With today's actions we are significantly increasing our flexibility to meet our funding needs under a variety of scenarios. Clearly, cash is the key metric to watch this year. On the other hand '09 earnings will depend in large measure on the economy and to what extent business jet demand recovers. In any event our earnings performance is going to jet [ph] this year. As a result we have adjusted our outlook to reflect this challenge. We now estimate earnings from continuing operations before special charges will be in a range of $0.45 to $0.75 per share.", "I am going to close on one final point. While we are focused on cash we remained committed to improving our core manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies and continuing to invest prudently in new products across the businesses, so that when we emerge from this economy we will re-poise to resume growth and to generate very significant shareholder value. I look forward to keeping you informed and updated on our progress, and with that I will turn it over to Scott. Scott?", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank you, Lewis. Good morning, everyone. I would like to start a discussion this morning on manufacturing side of the business where our focus remained on driving productivity, improving our working capital efficiency and generating cash from these businesses. We achieved and had plan cash flow position in the first quarter as we saw early results from our efforts to reduce our inventories and conserve cash. Our only inventory growth which we will talk about later is in Cessna.", "Perfect demonstration this was evident our industrial businesses were despite significant volume declines of 35% led by nearly 40% decrease in Caltex, resulting from the reduction in global auto production reductions. However, we were able to offset much of the profit impact and post a solid improvement in sequential profitability and more importantly industrial posted a sequential improvement in cash flow as well.", "So, as we look at the full-year as result of our combined cost reduction working capital improvement plans, we believe industrial businesses will generate positive profitability and solid cash flow.", "Textron Systems, we think about the Textron System's business while revenues were down on a year-over-year basis primarily reflecting slight reductions in unmanned aircraft systems and military training simulation systems as well as Lycoming commercial engine volumes. We do continue to see strong demand for this products. It's important to point out that, although, we had a lower comparison in the first quarter we will ship more UAS in 2009 than we did in 2008.", "The comparison only reflects a slippage of units from 2007 to 2008 in the first quarter of last year. So, despite this we still see very strong demand for UAS, our armored security vehicles and our Textron defense products for both US government as well as growing international opportunities. And so we had a very strong quarter, it's clearly our strongest business in the quarter where revenues grew approximately 29% and cash flow also solidly positive.", "The increased revenue reflect a strong demand in the military side as we delivered five V-22 versus four last year and nine Kiowa Warrior retrofits under the safety enhancement program. We also had a higher military spares in H-1 program support revenues.", "On the commercial side of Bell, deliveries were also up by 15 as we delivered 37 helicopters. This included three 407s that we delivered to the US Army for prototyping ultimate delivery to the Iraqis. We recently signed the contract for additional 24 units to be delivered in 2010 and 2011 with an option for additional 26, 407 beyond that.", "Commercial spares and service revenues were also up in the quarter by 8% and finally our commercial (inaudible) made a significant contribution of revenues in the quarter as well. While we have seen some demand weakness on the commercial side we been able to offset this with customers moving forward in our backlog, new orders and paramilitary demand. As a result we remain on-track to deliver about 180 commercial aircrafts this year.", "Importantly, the long-term outlook at Bell remains solid, especially in US government, homeland security and paramilitary segments. At Cessna we continue to experience weak order demand. We are taking all the right actions to maximize our cash generation over the next two years while continue to support an appropriate amount of product development as Lewis referred to.", "In the quarter, we recorded 92 net cancellations about half of those were pre-deliveries in 2009 the balance being out to 2010/2011. The customers agreed to move forward from their related over slots, plus orders in the quarter and the 69 aircraft which we did deliver in the first quarter, we have for the total year 295 sold positions in March.", "Therefore, as we did announce last month we are further reducing our production plans and currently held production target to build about 325 jets this year. Our production goal is to minimize white tails at the end of the year, while protecting our sold slots new order book. And please keep in mind that any white tails or finished goods inventory that we do have at the end of 2009 obviously we would expect to sell in the early part of 2010.", "With respect to 2009 deliveries it certainly it\u2019s very difficult in this market to forecast accurately. However, we do analyze our backlog and identify those risks and look at remaining orders on a very regular basis. We continue to pursue opportunities to move additional customers forward in our backlog and of course, our sales teams are working on prospects for new orders. Given this environment we believe we will deliver somewhere in the 209 to 300 aircraft this year.", "Importantly, from a cash flow perspective we are working very aggressively on our working capital. We are starting to see reductions in process but continue to see growth in the first and second quarter in terms of finished goods as a result of aircraft royalty [ph] in the production schedule. However, we are confident that in the third and fourth quarter those aircrafts will turn to cash and significantly reduce our inventories.", "To wrap up, on Cessna we are monitoring our ordering and cancellation activity on a daily basis, we have extensive programs underway to continue to restructure and reside the program to meet appropriate demand and we do expect to generate maximum cash this year and next.", "Finally, let's cover TFC, where we did a meaningful progress for liquidation of our non-cap to finance receivables. Importantly, we took the opportunity to work with many of our lower credits early-on as we had a contractual right to do so in the case where many customers were in technical default. In other words, the reduction was not accomplished primarily from our better credits within the portfolio, but we reduced a larger percentage of our weaker credits than our better credits, so we believe our progress is all the more meaningful.", "In terms of where the run off occurs in portfolio the two large projections came in our distribution finance and asset based lending businesses as shown on page 6. And earlier this month we signed an agreement with P&C [ph] subsidiary that will allow them to originate a portion of our new E-Z-GO financing which in turn reduces our funding needs and improves our liquidity position.", "(inaudible) about the quarter our first quarter reduction while these liquidations are certainly easier at the beginning of the process, historically liquidations are highest during the spring and summer months due to cyclical seasonal nature of many of the parts financed in our distribution finance business. This pattern may not necessarily be so strong in 2009 due to decline in balances but the seasonal trends are in our favor.", "On a credit performance front results worsen in the quarter reflecting continued deterioration in the general economy to some extent our decision to liquidate. Non-accrual finance receivables, total receivables held for investment increased to 6.1% compared to 4.0% at the end of the year. Charge-offs did increase to 2.82% on an annualized basis compared to about 1% in 2008.", "Deterioration of credit quality was most prevalent in the aircraft portfolio reflecting deterioration in used aircraft prices and related collateral values and our resort business where we saw increases in customer defaults and general lack of liquidity in that industry. If you look at page 7, you can see our new charge-offs projections for the full-year.", "Now let's talk about liquidation progress and the impact it had on cash flow of TFC starting on page 8. The reduction in receivables of $926 million was offset by net increases in hard assets we now own such as our net decrease in total finance assets was $838 million in the quarter. I want to point out that the repossessed assets fall in two categories those that we will immediately seek to monetize the disposition such as RVs, boats and other consumer durables and in fact we have reached a point now where we certainly are repossessing every week but we are also selling assets out of that at a light rate every week. And assets we will operate and improve for future dispositions and better markets such as golf courses. While we are foreclosing those golf courses, we hire professional management who will continue to operate those forces until we can sell those assets at a reasonable price.", "Actual cash generation from finance assets at discounts and other non-cash reductions in $779 million which represents cash conversion rate of about 93%.", "To summarize, TFC were well ahead of schedule with our receivables reduction and cash generation and we are very please with our cash conversion rate. Looking forward as distribution finance portfolio notification window is now behind us, we expect to see second quarter liquidation will be about as large as those in the first quarter. By the way, with deceleration of liquidations, we expect an acceleration of losses as well. Therefore, we are now estimating finance segment losses ranging between $225 million and $250 million for the full-year, reflecting the impact of pass due liquidation and a tougher credit environment.", "Nonetheless, we believe our total cash collection over the next several years will be consistent with our original plan, but on an accelerated time line.", "Before I conclude, let me take a moment of update you on our expanded restructuring program. With softening demand across our commercial businesses, we are now taking out additional capacity and overhead costs, most notably at Cessna. Correspondingly, we now estimate full-year restructuring charges will be approximately $75 million, up from our previous estimate of about $40 million. This brings our total headcount reduction to about 8,300 employees or about 20% of our global workforce.", "To conclude, despite continuing headwinds, we believe first quarter results demonstrated that we are taking necessary actions and have the right programs in place, to maximize cash generations as we manage through this difficult times. And with the actions, we are now taking to streamline our cost. We do believe when economy recovers we will expect to see significant operating leverages as we ramp up commercial volumes.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Doug.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Scott. Going now back to our Q1 EPS from continuing operations excluding restructuring charges of $0.26, let's examine the major drivers that drove the $0.62 reduction from last year\u2019s result. We are now on page nine of our schedules. As you would expect, the largest driver on the manufacturing side was lower volume which costs $0.67. We achieved positive pricing of 2.6% which added $0.16 per share. This was partially offset by $0.09 of inflation reflecting an inflation rate of 1.2%.", "As we mentioned, the CESCOM sale was worth $0.13. Overall cost performance benefited the quarter by $0.10, taxes provided a positive $0.04 on a year-over-year basis. And this reflects a $0.09 in discrete items this year compared to $0.05 in discrete items in last years first quarter. Discreet items this year were primarily due to benefits from a tax election enabled by Canadian legislation enacted in the quarter and the recognition of previously unbenefited capital losses as a result of the CESCOM gain.", "Lower corporate expenses contributed a positive $0.04 benefit and miscellaneous items including lower interest expense provided a $0.01.", "On the negative side of the ledger, used aircraft valuation adjustments at Cessna cost $0.03. This reflects 51 used aircraft on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, with a carrying value of $247 million. Headwinds from engineering, research and development and depreciation cost $0.03 and the remaining $0.28 of the year-over-year decline came from TFC.", "With respect to TFCs managed receivable portfolio, schedule 10 shows ending balances among the categories of captive held for investment and held for sale. The schedule reflects the fact that we move two portfolios worth about $650 million from held for sale to held for investment as we determine that this assets would generate greater value if we were to perceive orderly liquidation there instead of outright sale.", "Turning now to our full year outlook, you can find forecast of segment results on page 11 of the schedules and page 12 provides forecast of corporate P&L items. You can see that our new outlook incorporates lower interest cost reflecting net savings from having drawn our bank lines and our outlook also includes a number of tax benefits expected to incur during the balance of the year.", "We will wrap up by mentioning that our manufacturing free cash flow outlook of $400 million includes expected pension plan contributions this year of about $70 million and cash restructuring cost of about $100 million. With that, Kent we are pleased to take calls at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Great. Thank you very much. (Operator instructions) And our first question in this morning comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS, please go ahead.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Good morning, thank you.", "Lewis Campbell", "Good morning, David.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "The securitization that you have remaining for the rest of this year $2.3 billion. Can you tell us how that kind of plays out through the year what comes due Q2, Q3, Q4?", "Tom Cullen", "Hi, this is Tom Cullen. The total liquidation is going to about billion in the second quarter and it's reduced about $900 million in the third quarter than finally about $500 million in the fourth quarter come up to the roughly $3.1 billion for the full-year forecast.", "Doug Wilburne", "David by the way that was Tom Cullen, CFO of Textron Financial and for the benefit everybody else listening.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Great, thanks. Moving to Cessna, Lewis on the 290 to 300 revise production schedule, what portion of that you actually sold on and could you also just comment on how the service business is performing?", "Lewis Campbell", "Sure. Well we have sold possessions of 295, so right in the middle of that spread. So that's fact number one. Fact two, the service business is doing well. The only comment I have to make though is that we are doing well for the business we are getting. We still have strong service business but on the other hand with aircraft usage down you do have necessary less opportunities to do overall and repairs etcetera, so I think rolling will be up slightly this year versus last.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. My last one on the $400 million forecast for manufacturing free cash flow. Does that assume the working capital is basically neutral for the full year?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, it doesn\u2019t. It reflects significant reduction in working capital across the businesses. Most of which we are already starting to see. The one area where we have not yet seen in a reduction in working capital, Cessna and that\u2019s really just a function of the fact that our production plan because it was so high coming into the year declines over the course of the year, so we have a fair bit of finished good inventory that\u2019s been manufactured in Cessna in the first and second quarter. But that will play out as those aircraft were sold in third and fourth quarter, but in net we are seeing reductions and would expect to see further reductions in working capital over the course of the year. That are part of that $400 million plan.", "Lewis Campbell", "David it's a plus or minus is around $225 million in working capital fees.", "David Strauss \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Yes, thank you very much. You mentioned suspending the Columbus program, what does that mean for R&D assessment, where was it in the first quarter and where should we expect it to be for the year?", "Lewis Campbell", "We are going to get that, we are out of schedule. We just got dig it up. Let me just give an overview on this of though and that is don\u2019t write the Columbus of your radar screen because we have decided that we need to be careful with our R&D spending across a company and that program was going to take effect and be sold in the commerce about 2013 or so and until we know much more about the market it's going to be selling into we thought it was more prudent to suspend it and then to redirect all of our efforts to invest in our existing core products at Bell and Cessna. So that\u2019s what we have done. Now I don\u2019t know math, do you have math on the actual R&D spend.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, if you looked at 2009, we would have forecast the funding this year around 285 that\u2019s ramping down obviously we were probably in the year now depending someone on Columbus and we will have some close our cost associated with it. We will taking that down to run-rate more or like $242 million a year.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "And where was it in the first quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Hold down just a second while I have to get that for you.", "Doug Wilburne", "While he is digging that up, Cai can we talk about anything else, while we will address that.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "I have, yes, a very quick question, in your 10-K you mention I think that you are going to have to make $370 million in pension contribution in 2010 and 11, what does that number look like today given you had more layoffs, any guidance on that or rough color?", "Lewis Campbell", "Yes, as we said in our prepare remarks, we are looking at about $70 million this year, next year it's drive to about $50 million to $55 million.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Yes.", "Lewis Campbell", "But we are still looking at that higher level going into 2011 and that\u2019s all reflected in our liquidity outlook.", "Tom Cullen", "Cai, one of the things on our liquidity model is, it takes about two pages in order show all the line details that we show or for our own use. So some of these things are collapsed in other line item, so apologize for that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi Cai, its Scott, actual spending in the first quarter at Cessna was just a little over $82 million.", "Cai von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Excellent, thank you very much guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, okay.", "Operator", "Thanks. And we have a question from the line of Ron Epstein with Banc of America. Please go ahead.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "Hi, good morning guys. How many white tails do you actually have right now and how big is your inventory of used Cessna jets that are on waiting to get sold?", "Lewis Campbell", "We said, we gave already numbers prepared remarks in terms of used and for market reasons we are not going to give you an exact white fair number that we\u2019ve got now and obviously, we are building inventory in the first half and hopefully to see that flow through in sales in the second half.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "Well, I think I am curious, how that happened? I thought, you guys had all process and managing the backlog, it control over your sales force. I mean how did we getting up in a situation when you do have any white tail.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think if you are remember, going back to, middle to later part of last year, production forecast were one point around 500 jets and so you had a whole supply chain, suppliers, internal production, in terms of number of labor and production line rates were designed to do that. And so that team has been scaling back in terms of both our in-house workforce and going out working with our suppliers but the fact the matter is, the relatively long lead associated with a lot of that material.", "So the most efficient way to manage this ramp down has been, you do what as we take our own internal labor down as we are able to turn off that incoming supplier material. So if you look at the year and again as we did taking labor out and saw incoming stream it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. So as we ramp this thing down, you are obviously, you have a lot higher build rates in the first quarter and second quarter than the third and fourth quarter, so, the plan that we have right now and we obviously just announced in other round of way off, in the business, is to continue to bring that production rate down but it does take those periods bring those curtail and again we had an off a lot of long lead material that was in the pipeline through our supplier.", "So, obviously we take that in consideration, so as we continue to try balance production versus demand but it will result in old production the first and second quarter.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "Now, Scott, I mean how should we think about, I guess the margin in Cessna if you normalize out the $50 million (inaudible) of the CESCOM asset or just under 5%, I mean when we think about where should Trauff [ph] margins be in that business, when you are add say Trauff delivery.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I think, we probably are in that Trauff, I mean, cost as coming out, I think we probably bottom on that margin rate, he saw that we will maintain, out or above that rate even with lower volumes through the balance of 2009 and lower volumes in 2010 as well.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. And then just one last question follow up, when David ask how should think about you are getting to your cash flow guidance given that you had such a cash outflow this quarter, I mean, I just don\u2019t understand how you are going to get there, help me understand that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, I mean, if you look at the balance I mean I think we had at or better than what we have planed pretty significantly in fact out of most of business in terms of reductions and working capital and overall cash efficiencies the only thing that offset it was the build up on inventory coming through Cessna, I know, you know first quarter was always difficult quarter for us from a cash perspective just because \u2013 that number reflects not only the operating businesses but all the corporate cost things like hedging against stock based compensation things like that, which were cash outflows in the first quarter. So there is some unusual things that don\u2019t occur in this first quarter, which obviously was factored into our plan, but I would say from an operation perspective, the big swing is really the reductions of those inventories Cessna in the third and fourth quarter.", "Lewis Campbell", "Yes, let me add one more comment to that, because I know that Scott mind when you look at the charge we put up you here in the numbers we've talked about obviously we are pretty strong in that $400 million number for the end of the year and just another fact which you may know about I just I said in my opening remarks but you may have missed it, we had because we change the way we incentive pay the top 1000 managers. We changed our annual incentive compensation or our bonus formula if you will and I should have mentioned that 50% of the top 1000 managers in the company, 50% of their bonus which is always targeted as a percentage of their base salary lets say its 30% and then half of that 30% or 15% will be based on them making their stretch cash targets.", "We never done that before but we have had experience in redesigning the comp system to gain improvement and a metric most notably ROIC [ph] when we went from 8 to 21. So I would be very surprised and disappointed if we don\u2019t see the kind of improvement that our managers are signing up for.", "Another point may not be obvious, Cessna is still a strong cash generator in '09, '10 and '11. And so our balance system, so 80% of the company are very strong positive cash flow generators.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "So, just want to following to those comments.", "Lewis Campbell", "Yes.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "With the Textron Six Sigma, the engineering of Textron I would have expected in the downturn that may be Cessna would do better but it looks like you kind of going back to the historical performance of Cessna in a downturn. I mean how should I think about the impact of the both that whole program for the company and in industrial downturn. I mean to me it doest look like its paying off in the downturn.", "Lewis Campbell", "Well if you would remind me to respectfully disagree with you in front of about 160 people I would like to, because \u2013", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "That\u2019s fine, that\u2019s great.", "Lewis Campbell", "I know, I know, look it takes a Herculean effort to be planning to run at about 500 plus deliveries in October of '08 for the calendar 2009 and then take that number down to 290 to 300. That is a tough thing to do. Secondly if you think about it although we manufactured planes about (inaudible) more efficiently in most others. When you think about it you can't just stop, and you cant just change the production and pull plans out of the sequence. You get stuck actually making a plan if someone cancels on in the first quarter so then what we have to do to move up someone out of the second quarter, third quarter or 2010 which we been pretty successful in doing. So although it would appear to you and I don\u2019t blame that they are saying that our numbers are different than you might have thought. I'll give you another interesting comment. Back in 2001 when our margins, 2002 and '03 when our margins dropped as a result of 9/11 we were not production any Mustangs, Mustangs have a very low profit contribution.", "So if when you take a look at the mix of businesses we have to factor that in to, when considering the number we are producing I would say our margin has held up pretty darn well in fact most people believe that had we not had Six Sigma and Lean in place we'd have been much worse off.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "Great. Well thank for all the comments guys.", "Lewis Campbell", "Yes.", "Tom Cullen", "Before we go to the next question I just want to follow up Ron because I think your question about cash flow is one that is on the top of a lot of peoples mind and even though in the overall scheme, our overall liquidity plan it\u2019s a small piece. I really want to understand, if you look at the mid point of our range that results in manufacturing net income of about 255 million. And when you go down through the map to get the 400 that\u2019s going to require an increase or a contribution from working capital of about 225 million. So its not that big of a stretch when you think about it in those terms because obviously as Scott explained in the first half of the year we've got the momentum in the production process at Cessna and to a extent that we saw those in the second half of the year that working capital is going to recover.", "Not to mention all the programs that we have underway to just streamline our supply chains. So if you doubt that we are going to able to sale al those planes in the second half of the year then you just move it out to 2010 again as Scott kind of explained. So the cash flow from manufacturing operations over the next two years I think we feel pretty comfortable about the cumulative $900 million on our schedule there.", "Lewis Campbell", "The other items for the quarter we talked about interest and taxes and comp programs and various expenses the run rate for the year is $500 million to $600 million. We will have spent or we did spent close to 300 in Q1. So, essentially you will see substantially less cash used than those categories in remaining three quarters than you did in the first.", "Ron Epstein \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay.", "Doug Wilburne", "Yeah. Al right next question please.", "Operator", "Great thank you your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.", "Lewis Campbell", "Hi Steve.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Lewis Campbell", "Good morning.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Just a question on the can rate going into the second quarter, how front end loaded was toward cancellation in the quarter and where you are seeing as you kind of get out of first quarter?", "Lewis Campbell", "Steve, the cancellation rates I mean its bit lumpy. So I think that what the trend we are seeing is that we are starting to see a tapering off of cancellations that relate to aircraft deliveries for 2009. We are still continue to see cancellations in 2010 and 2011 timeframe and frankly I think we will see than you should expect to see significant cancellations in the second quarter, although primarily associated with aircraft or related your deliveries. In particular, having announced the suspension of the Columbus program for instance you would expect to see quite a few cancellations of Columbus orders in this quarter across those are deliveries who are out in 2014, 2015 timeframe so.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. So you will take those at a backlog you consider those cancellations and those who come through mostly in the second quarter?", "Lewis Campbell", "Yes, that's correct.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And on that front I am just interested when they go in a backlog I assumed that there was a deposit, what are the timing is to what you have to return those deposits?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think if you look at something like the Columbus where it's result of customers' cancellations result of our suspension in the program you expect to see that cash flow virtually immediately back to our customers. Obviously that's a very different situation and our customer might cancel when aircraft is almost complete in which case mostly as we are keeping majority not all that the deposit account for remarketing and reconfiguration there.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "But you said that the $2 billion backlog you had of Columbus, is it fair to say that like 10% of that and that's kind of mostly you are thinking about?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, the amount of deposits that we have on Columbus it's still over date.", "Lewis Campbell", "It's about $50 million worth of deposits that we had taken on Columbus.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. From the net manageable. And then just on commercial helicopters what was the orders in the quarter? And what was that year-over-year?", "Lewis Campbell", "Our net orders in and out of the backlog, Steve where on a unit basis were slightly negative and on a dollar basis were slightly positive.", "Scott Donnelly", "Generally the trend that we are seeing, Steve is we had some cancellations that have been primarily in the 407 and 206 of the lighter or smaller helicopters and where we seen the strength in the orders has been in the 412s, which is\u2026", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "You are saying slightly negative on year-over-year comp per basis, or all in that cancellations?", "Scott Donnelly", "All in that cancellations.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And then one more question is on how quickly you noticed that production doesn\u2019t really ramp down, so does that mean we are having other season where we done free cash period in the second quarter, I know cash is tough to predict, but you seem to be predicting it with a pretty good visibility here outside the year. Is second quarter also negative?", "Scott Donnelly", "Assessment, we will still have cash consumption assumption for it.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "And for the company?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I would say that it could be closed.", "Lewis Campbell", "Close to even there.", "Scott Donnelly", "It's going to be closed.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Scott Donnelly", "We worked ahead of our plan, in Q1 we are working hard try to get that in Q2 as well.", "Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Great. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noel Poponac with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Lewis Campbell", "Hello, Noel", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi, how are you?", "Lewis Campbell", "Good.", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Little more clarity on the assessment numbers, how many of the 290 to 300 are most tanks?", "Lewis Campbell", "The mostly of the 295 is probably going to be somewhere in the 120 to 130 range.", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, that's not really changing?", "Lewis Campbell", "No, most tanks are actually holding pretty well.", "Scott Donnelly", "Most tanks are fairly easy because we have a such a big backlog, so as we seen the customer mix shift little bit that's can be our number.", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, that makes sense. And gave us a sold out number for '09, can you tell us how many aircrafts are sold for 2010?", "Scott Donnelly", "We can't believe it. Actually right now we feel pretty good about 2010 on the order book, but I don\u2019t think it's smart to put that number out there because until we see cancellation is stabilized and as Scott mentioned there attending to rate softening some, so that's good. Right now I will be happy if we went through the year and started from where we are and build slightly in 2010 that would be a pretty good year for us. We know exactly what our production schedule. We\u2019ll be down that run rate by mid-2009 and that\u2019s kind of how we see.", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay and you\u2019re taking up the full-year target for the run-offs at $3.1 billion you know obviously it\u2019s been successful to-date but you guys had sort of alluded to you know if you had early success you maybe want to pull back for collateral and had alluded to you know not wanting to take up the target because you know you would be pushing people into a greater loss position. Can you just tell us how that\u2019s split out has made has the better credit market made it a lot easier to move people to other sources of financing and so the losses are as better, what\u2019s your thinking in taking that target higher?", "Lewis Campbell", "Well there is a number of things on I think primarily our philosophy on this is that as we went through the first quarter we had originally set our target. We obviously more than \u2013 I mean we almost doubled it so we had a dramatic improvement like a couple of things one is that because the economy has still been pretty tough. A lot of the dealers that we work on finance are also being cautious about increasing their inventory. So, in many cases as those customers sold those assets. We got paid. So moved the receivables of cash and in many cases they didn\u2019t finance up because they didn\u2019t want to increase our inventory.", "Now we have actually gone past the period where we're committed to phone them and so we don\u2019t have a financing requirement going forward so when we laid out the original plan, we had assumed that we\u2019ll have to do more financing in the first quarter until we had given a notice period to these dealers who\u2019re not going to financing going forward. So, basically what happened is we're taking all of the improvements in the accelerated receivables reduction that we achieved in the first quarter and since we're making that additive to our plan for the year so right now really what we're doing is executing at the plan we would have expected in the balance of the year and by the way so far that\u2019s going right on track. So, if you take what we over achieved in the first quarter and add that to the $2.6 billion with the $3.1 billion.", "Noel Poponac \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you and we do have a question now from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on, I understand that can you describe to us a bit your bookings policy and how that stands vis-\u00e0-vis other OEs in the industry, I'm just trying to understand you know given the decreased cancellations we've seen in the less-than-twelve month timeframe. How does that give us confidence that your contract terms are really and truly firm?", "Lewis Campbell", "I can start with it, we have had the same contract terms for (inaudible) since. I have been here and came in 92 basically the same. Let me say how they work and the basement when you put an order you actually make a non-refundable deposit or we do not count it as an order. That deposit is approximately a quarter of million dollar, okay, and then depending on the model and the price for the model you then have to make I\u2019ll call it progress deposit payments all of which are non-refundable. For the large planes eighteen months prior to delivery you may have to put a million dollars. So now you\u2019re a million and a quarter in.", "A year prior to delivery you make another deposit of a million dollar so now you\u2019re two and quarter in and six months prior to delivery you make another million dollars so you\u2019re three and a quarter in and that will be true for the Sovereign Citation term. Now just to make this quick so I want to do is one item.", "If you slide down to the XLS which would have a list pricing about $11 million you\u2019ll have your first quarter to million in and then you would make nine months and six months pre-delivery payments of half a million each so you'll have a million and quarter in. if you cancel and you provide us a notification that you\u2019re canceling we then follow a procedure where we have to inform you that we intend to keep that plane that deposit. If you\u2019ve got a loan with the bank, the bank has the option to buy the plane and if they turn us down then we keep the deposit and you have no access to it and that\u2019s been in-place and we use that religiously and we have to admit though that in a hot year if we are at a year of strong sales and something happened that we thought was reasonable from a good customer.", "Now remember 70% of our customers. I repeat then we might make a deal with you to say look okay. We're going to keep your deposit. We're going to keep all the interest on your deposit but let\u2019s see if you can book another order in 2010 or 11. Obviously, that\u2019s not the case this year because the cancellation rates are higher and the production volumes are down. So, we keep the deposits.", "Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley", "Alright, thanks. But it still, I guess, one would always think that the near-term deliveries would be firmer than the further out ones but, you talked about knowing exactly what the production schedule is for 2010 and yet again there has been a 50% decline in your deliveries for \u2019'09, between what you guide in October versus what you are guiding now here in April. What processes are you engaging and that gives you better visibility for next year than you feel that you had this year and can you also touch on what's been going with pricing because obviously was rising inventory. You got to be challenged on the pricing front.", "Lewis Campbell", "I mean these are pretty extraordinary times. So I think it is very hard to go back and compare how those process plays out versus how it is playing out today. I mean I don\u2019t think that we have ever seen a period of time where you have customers to get to a point where they have actually picked interiors. They have don\u2019t paint, everything and at the last minute want to walk with aircraft. And I think it is driven by the general economic situation. I think we have cases everyday. A customer comes in. They made all the deposits. They have actually come out. They have done the paint. They have done everything they want on the aircraft. And they try to turn around inventory of 10% to 20% of the workforce.", "So, when they come back and say look we just can't \u2013 we can't fly in our new airplane in to our account, having just laid off a bunch of our employees. So, as we said. We work for the customer like that. Many of this are already customers and they probably would came back. But it is not going to be this year. So, I think these are pretty extraordinary times. We talked about where we are in '9 and what are our visibility is into 2010, again not a process we had to do in the past but we are trying to maintain very regular communication with our customers. If you look at our production schedules both for this year and next year, we look at every quarter number, we talk to every customer, we try to assess the risk, is the customer going to stay in the backlog, is the customer going to cancel. So we are talking to them. We are talking to some cases to their financial institutions, understand and make sure the financing is solid. So, I mean I wish I could tell you that we had perfect visibility and clearly we don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think anybody in the industry does.", "Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley", "No, I am just trying to understand if this process is giving you additional insight to better know how to base line 2010. I mean, obviously, 2009 is going period. That\u2019s clear. But obviously there is a learning process as well. So, I am just trying to understand if there is a new aspects to the conversations. It does give you a reason to have confidence for 2010, that would be greater than 2009. And also please touch on pricing.", "Scott Donnelly", "I am sorry. So, anyway, I think what the new process is that the number of contacts, we had communication with the customer to understand where they are, are they really in the backlog, are they really going to move out, or are they really going to cancel is much greater than it is ever been before. It is not a perfect process. We still have customer that shows up when something change at the last minute. But I think the visibility we have on the balance for 2009 and then through 2010 is all derived by that level of contact in trying to understand exactly what's going on for every single customer situation, which we just never had to do before.", "On the pricing front, clearly there is pricing pressure in the industry, used aircraft values in particular have dropped significantly. What we have been doing is on the new aircraft side, we are not moving on those pricing, we are working with customers to do special things, say maintenance and support kind of activities so we can give them some additional value to them to taking aircraft, to coming to order book, in some cases beyond what we would normally like to do, but we are trying to protect pricing of the new aircraft.", "On the used aircraft front, obviously that\u2019s a very dynamic market, and we do have some special programs, we are running right now, in order to move our used aircraft, where customers are interested but are concerned is it going to be a further reduction in the we value of that aircraft, in some cases ,we are actually going to guarantee that values so we will give the customer a several year window. They take the aircraft, they pay for the aircraft, right to put that aircraft back to us at the end of that term or deal the trade-in to something else and so where base could rise. We think that\u2019s in the best interest of moving that used aircraft, bringing the cash in and getting customers back out there and using this aircraft.", "Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley", "Alright. Great. Thanks very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "Good morning.", "Lewis Campbell", "Hi Rob.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "First question, you had obviously quite a few cancellations in the quarter. I was wondering if you could give us some flavor where it's coming from in terms of geographical distribution. And I think possibly industries that accounts (inaudible)?", "Lewis Campbell", "Well, Rob, the distribution as I said is roughly about half 2009 deliveries and half future deliveries. I know how the data thing puts in but I haven't seen any trend of specific segments or specific kinds of individuals or companies that are canceling. Obviously we get a very broad range of different sort of root causes for the cancellations. Many are the just general economic conditions and remember a lot of our aircraft because they are the small to midsize aircraft or small companies, I mean, in some cases work individual but generally they are registration new corporations and represents a small businesses.", "I think in generally you see a lot of people that you have a difficult situation of their business which can either manifest itself, it difficulty getting financing. We certainly see some of that or as refer to earlier, just (inaudible) a lot of people and don\u2019t feel like, it looks right for them to come in brand new aircraft when they are in the process of laying off bunch of employee, so which I think if you go back and you look at the trends which I think you probably as familiar as anybody with that business jet industries won the cycles very, very highly correlate US cope for profits.", "So, in times are good, people are buying aircraft, when times are not they differ or cancel those aircraft. So historically that has been a very, very hard correlation factor and frankly we would expect that going forward. So as you see the economy strengthen people start brining employees back in and the company start doing better we would expect also to see the demand for the business just pick up again.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "12 months ago, you were talking about the international side to be very strong. It came to by a 50% of orders, have these new international customers proved to be more speak even some of your US customers or picking the calls when you are trouble?", "Lewis Campbell", "I don\u2019t know if there any particularly statistical difference at this point rather we can go kind try to chase that data down but you are seeing the situation both domestic and internationally. I know you pick up some international orders here in the quarter and we certainly shipping a lot of international aircraft but we\u2019re still on balance or shipping a lot of US aircraft as well.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "I just finally, Lewis, you said that you went looking to Cessna's core assets, are there any non core assets that you might be interested disposing on that the next 12 months?", "Lewis Campbell", "Well I don\u2019t think it would be fair us to comment on that. I think it best for us to kind of keep things close until we announce we have got sign of distribution sales but I just couldn\u2019t comment on that. If we were, if we weren't, I apologize for that.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Lewis Campbell", "Sure. Alright kind understand there are no more questions in queue. I just want to do one clarification earlier I think David Strauss ask a question about the securitization and amortization to the rest of the year, and I think we misunderstood and gave a full manage receivables amortization. So, on the $2.262 billion of securitization it actually amortizes 490 in the second quarter, 757 in the third, and 335 in the fourth for the full year amount. So with that, that concludes our call, and we thank everybody for your interest in Textron and we will talk to you soon.", "Operator", "Great. Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thanks for your participation.

(NYSE:TXT) Q2 2009 Earnings Call July 28, 2009  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Lewis Campbell - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Scott Donnelly - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Doug Wilburne - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Analysts", "", "Steve Tusa - JP Morgan ", "David Strauss - UBS", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "[Scott Brugle] - Davidson Kempner", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Barclays", "Ron Epstein - BOA", "Robert Stallard - Macquarie", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Textron second quarter earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Teddy and good morning everyone. Before we begin I\u2019d like to mention our discussion today will include remarks about future estimates and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our filings and also into today\u2019s press release.", "You can also find an earnings call presentation slide deck containing key data items from today\u2019s call in the Investor Relations section of our website. We will be referring to those slides during the process of the call so be sure to pull those down. On the call today we have Lewis Campbell, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s, President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Moving now to second quarter results, revenues in the quarter were $2.6 billion, down 29% from a year ago, which yield-to-date GAAP loss of $0.22 per share. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations excluding restructuring charges were $0.08 per share, down $0.90 from a year ago.", "Textron recorded second quarter pre-tax special charges of $129 million associated with the company\u2019s restructuring program. This included $43 million in non-cash impairment related to the cancellation of the Citation Columbus development program, and $25 million of non-cash charges associated with recognition of pension related prior service cost triggered by headcount reduction.", "Manufacturing operations provided $27 million of positive cash flow during the second quarter. This positive cash flow was achieved despite incurring cash payments of $77 million in return customer deposit at Cessna and $39 million for enterprise restructuring. Now let\u2019s examine the major drivers that drove over the $0.90 year-over-year reduction in adjust EPS, which are outlined on slide four of the earnings call presentation. ", "As you would expect, the largest driver was lower manufacturing volume which drove $0.86 of the reduction. TFCs lower earnings contributed $0.29 to the decline in EPS and used aircraft valuation adjustments at Cessna cost $0.10. ", "We achieved positive pricing of 1.4%, which added $0.09 per share. This is partially offset by $0.06 of inflation, reflecting an inflation rate of .8%. Overall cost performance including selling, general and administrative benefited the quarter by $0.29. Tax rate changes contributed $0.02 and miscellaneous items provided a penny.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lewis.", "Lewis Campbell", "Thanks Doug and good morning everyone. Once again this quarter we had real solid performances that balance systems. On the other side of the coin so to speak, we continued to experience market challenges at Cessna, industrial and finance.", "Looking on the positive side though we generate manufacturing cash flow, that was positive this quarter which reflected our efforts to improve working capital productivity and lower cost. This is a specially noteworthy considering the significant volume decline experienced at Cessna and industrial. So, I think it\u2019s a job well done on the second quarter on cash. ", "Finally, we made a significant progress liquidating non-GAAP refinance receivables at TFC once again. We had a gross reduction of about $1.3 billion during the second quarter and cash conversion even better than what we expected.", "So, this brings us to a year-to-date reduction of $2.2 billion, which is nearly half of our original two year target of $4.5 billion. So, as you might expect with that success that we just demonstrated in Q2 we now increased our two year reduction target from $4.5 billion all the way up to $5.2 billion.", "With this in mind, let\u2019s take a look at our updated 2010 liquidity plan. I\u2019ll take a minute here to gets you turning over to slide five and that\u2019s our cash summary slide. If you then start on the second line labeled TFC receivable liquidation, there you see that we\u2019ve recorded the actual second quarter amount of $1.28 billion and reflected our higher two year goal in the full year 2009 and 2010 calls.", "On the next line, we\u2019ve reduced the \u201809 manufacturing cash flow projection by $50 million to $350 million reflecting lower expected jet deliveries, which we\u2019ll discuss later. We\u2019ve added the $775 million in proceeds from the equity and convert offerings we completed in May and moving down to the term debt payments line, the annual amounts are higher than in previous version as we\u2019ve been opportunistically retiring debt that is coming due in the next three years at meaningful discounts.", "So far we\u2019ve actually repurchased $393 million of face value debt at an average discount of almost 8%, and earlier this month, we consummated a $500 million facility with Ex-Im Bank for funding Cessna\u2019s and Bell\u2019s International customer purchases. ", "Expected proceeds from the Ex-Im facility, we actually spread across two years and the spread between 2009 and 2010 as we show on the chart. Next, the second quarter $648 million securitization payment actually includes a $150 million early payoff, again economically motivated on our part. ", "Finally, we paid off a $410 million advance we took against our company-owned life insurance program COLI, obviously we can re-borrow that at any time, but we don\u2019t see the need to have that borrowing at the present time, so we paid it back. In total then this result in a projected 2010 cash balance of just under $1.5 billion which is $1.3 billion better than our original plan.", "Now once you heard the cash story, let\u2019s go to slide six and this will then summarize our liquidity position. Our total liquidity improvement consists of the higher cash, plus $111 million in a lower 2010 debt balance, which represents that portion of the $393 million in repurchased debt. ", "That would have matured after 2010, and the retirement of the $410 million insurance advanced I just mentioned. So we\u2019ve improved our 2010 liquidity position by almost $1.8 billion from our original plan which I believe is very good progress. ", "Moving to operations, we continue to focus on managing our commercial businesses for the slower economy. Our efforts are clearly evident in the fact that industrial generated positive profits and cash in the quarter in the face of volumes being down to 36%. ", "At Cessna, market weakness continued with net cancellations consisting of 74 Columbus orders, 59 from large fleet operators, 58 from our authorized sales reps and finally 52 from across the remainder of the order book.", "If you look at the balance of the year, we now have a 124 sold positions remaining for delivery during the second half. So, including the 84 deliveries made in the second quarter and 69 deliveries made in the first that bring us to 277 sold aircrafts for 2009. ", "So, we are now basing our \u201809 operating forecast on a delivery expectation of about 275 units, and as we look at the quality of the remaining \u201809 backlog, we believe we should be able to offset any further cancellations or deferrals with new \u201809 orders. With respect to order flow, we saw \u201809 cancellations stabilize somewhat in June, that's good news. ", "We also saw a modest improvement in new orders in June and let me give you the figures. During the first five months of the year, we averaged about three new gross orders per month. However, in June we booked seven all for delivery in 2009. ", "Now, seven gross orders remains low obviously, and one months experience is not establish a trend, but there were other data points from the marketplace that were carefully tracking that also look a bit positive. For example the number of used citation transactions also picked up in June and we saw stabilization in used pricing.", "Correspondingly, the availability of used citations dropped slightly to 17.3% from 17.6% in May, which is actually the first time this measure has dropped in over a year. The daily usage declined within the fleet also leveled-off in June. In fact ADUs were up slightly in Europe. One final point on-demand, our Ex-Im financing facility while improving liquidity will also support international purchases.", "So, we are not quite ready to call the bottom yet, but based on that data we are sure hoping that a period of stability is just around the corner, which should lead to further improved visibility at Cessna.", "As I\u2019ve said, when I began the call fortunately Bell and Textron Systems which are heavily defense and civil service oriented have been largely unaffected by the economy. They continue to perform well and are very well-positioned for solid growth. ", "We\u2019re executing the ramp up of the V-22, the H-1 and the unmanned aircraft systems and a host of other programs. For example, the Bell Commercial model 429, has just received Canadian and FAA-Certification earlier this month.", "We believe that with 30% greater cabin volume in any other model in its class, the 429 should be well received in the EMS and other utility markets and should contribute to Bell\u2019s future growth over long period of years. ", "My final topic today concerns two important executive announcements we\u2019re making this morning actually, they were made with releases that came out at the same time that our earnings were released.", "First, I am very pleased to announce that Frank Connor would be coming on board as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective August 1. Frank is a 22 year veteran of Goldman Sachs and Company, where most recently he was Managing Director and Head of Telecom Investment Banking there. ", "He has advised many companies, across a wide range of industries and executed numerous public and private financings and strategic transactions. Frank will be based right here in Providence. He will also receive all the company\u2019s financial activities and including the business units CFOs and their respective organizations. One final note, TFC will continue to report to Scott Donnelly. ", "I believe Frank will be a great addition to the Textron team as we focus on improving operating efficiency, enhancing cash flow and preparing the company for our future growth over the long term. ", "I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take a minute to thank Dick Yates for his great work he\u2019s done, not only as our Senior Vice President and Controller, but he also stepped in as our Acting CFO for the past six months, and I think we\u2019ve done a magnificent job there on liquidity, cash flow in just playing around the operations.", "Today we also announced John Garrison, who was previously heading our Industrial segment as the new President and CEO of Bell helicopter effective August, 1. He\u2019s replacing Dick Millman, who is retiring after 43 years with the company. ", "Scott will have more to say about this later, but I want to take the opportunity also to acknowledge Dick. He\u2019s been with us for 43 years. He is certainly accomplished a great deal and he is provided excellent leadership during his long career at Textron especially while he\u2019s been at Bell.", "Let me wrap up. Our liquidity plan is clearly working and we demonstrated meaningful progress once again in the second quarter. Even though we expect and incurred $150 million of pre-tax cash restructuring charges, we\u2019re forecasting 2009 manufacturing cash flow in the range of $300 million to 400 million. ", "As we offset a portion of lower expected cash at Cessna, with higher expected cash from the rest of our manufacturing unit. We\u2019re maintaining our EPS outlook from continuing ops before special charges between $0.33 and $0.36 for the year. ", "I\u2019ll close with the following point. We obviously are focused on cash generation and we\u2019ve remain committed to improving our core manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies. In combination with our continued investment in new products, we should position ourselves to generate significant shareholder value when we emerged from this downturn.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to, Scott. Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Lewis. Good morning, I\u2019d like to start talking about our manufacturing businesses as Lewis referenced, we did generate $27 million in free cash flow in the quarter, again ahead of our plan. I think this reflects the improvements we continue to make in working capital and overall operational efficiencies. In fact our inventory programs in particular are getting traction as we\u2019ve reduced inventory in the quarter by about $300 million.", "If you look at Cessna; Cessna revenue was down 42% driven by lower volumes. Profits down also, again primarily driven by lower volume, but also we incurred $38 million charge for lower our used aircraft values. These were partially offset by $38 million benefit from forfeited customer deposits. ", "I believe that used valuations appear to be stabilizing in June, so we would expect that number in terms of lost to moderate through the balance of the year. Similarly, we would expect a fewer benefits forfeited customer deposits again through the balance of this year.", "As we discussed in the first quarter call, Cessna consumed a considerable amount of cash in both the first and second quarter, as we continued at an accelerated production rate. We now expect Cessna will generate a significant amount of cash in the third and fourth quarter as we burn off that inventory particularly through finished goods. ", "Later cash flow obviously will depend on the actual number of new and used aircrafts that are delivered. Again we expect a significant improvement over the first couple of quarters. ", "We did take two major actions in the quarter at Cessna. As previously announced, we have elected to cancel the Columbus program. This is very unfortunate, but the realities of the marketplace create an uncertainty around that aircraft, we felt it this time in this market. We were better to spend our R&D to really defend our core in the small to mid size business jet market.", "Second, we have continued our further production rates and layoffs at Cessna to make sure we align our capacity with the demand in the marketplace. Our team has just returned last week and we now have what we believe is a workforce and a production rate that will maintain through the balance of 2009 and 2010, consistent with what we believe our deliveries will be. ", "We have a lot more work to do obviously, but I think the fact that we now appear to be a stable point in the market and have a good feel for the actual production demand. We can continue to make operational efficiencies and the right moves in that business.", "Industrial segment revenues were down 40%, primarily driven by volume with some unfavorable foreign exchange. Despite this we were able to drive $12 million in profit, in solid cash flow. This is reflection of the team\u2019s work and restructuring in cost at last year\u2019s commodity action prices.", "Kautex in particular, returned to profitability in the quarter and we believe that we\u2019ve seen some stabilization and actually a potential for some increasing volume, reflecting the bottoming of the global automotive market. So industrial margins, we believe as a result of the restructuring activities, when the volume return would be good performing businesses, not just at Kautex, but also E-Z-GO, Jacobsen and Greenlee.", "The Textron business revenues were up 2% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher defense volumes, offset somewhat by lower Lycoming volumes reflecting the slowdown of the general aviation market. Even in the general aviation market, we feel pretty good about where we are positioned right now with Lycoming. If fact this week at the Oshkosh Air Show, we\u2019re introducing the new innovated electronic engine, which really gives us some terrific breakthrough technology and differentiation in that market going forward.", "The defense business continues to grow. We see strong demand for both ASVs and our Shadow Unmanned Air Vehicles from U.S. government, as well as the increasing opportunities in the international marketplace, and we have a couple of [Inaudible] products named as Scorpion and Spider in the Ground Weapons Systems area that we think will continue to generate good growth into the future.", "Clearly, I think we\u2019re all expecting to see top line acquisition budgets decline in the coming years, but we believe that our products and the nature of how our products are used in the sort of complex that we\u2019ll continue to see growth in these businesses despite an overall top line decline. ", "Bell had very solid results in the quarter despite a slight revenue decline. Our military revenue was down primarily as a result of the cancellation of ARH development program, and some lower support for the H-1 program, offset by V-22 higher volumes.", "Commercially, while revenues were down slightly, the number of deliveries was up, 35 aircrafts versus 31 a year ago. The slight decline of revenue was just a mix shift away from 412 Aircraft, 407\u2019s and 206\u2019s. The margins were strong, solid improved performance in the business. We\u2019re actually generating significant solid cash generation out of Bell, despite the fact that we continue to ramp V-22, the VH-1 and now the commercial 429 program.", "We also reserved certification from the Defense Contract Management agency for our Earned Value Management System. This is a significant milestone for the business as it demonstrates the right management program control systems are in place at Bell, which supports our ongoing program, as well as credibility for future program opportunities.", "We also reached agreement with our unionized employees, who have been out on strike for about six weeks and UAW 218, that team returned to work yesterday. We\u2019re glad to have them back. We can now focus on the competitiveness and capable in that business.", "As Lewis mentioned, we also made an announcement this morning with the change of leadership. Dick Millman, will be retiring after 43 years. He\u2019s done a great job at Bell for the last couple of years. I think he leaves that business very well position in terms of our execution on military programs, the new certification of the 429 and obviously the important milestone of getting our union contracts negotiated. ", "John has been with us for a number of years, most recently running the industrial segment, he had great leadership skills and I think he\u2019ll be a great long term leader for the Bell business. ", "Let\u2019s talk about TFC. As Lewis mentioned, our liquidation plan is continue to make meaningful progresses. The receivables now at $8.6 billion versus $10.8 billion at the beginning of the year, so we remain ahead of plan in terms of the runoff rate of liquidation.", "As expected we are seeing continuing challenges in the credit markets, as a result of our liquidation and ongoing softening of the economy. 60 day plus delinquencies were up 6.2%, compared to 4.9% in the first quarter. Non-accruals rose to 10.04%, up from 6.11% in the first quarter, and this increase is primarily driven by a $149 million of increased non-accruals in our result portfolio, $95 million of which came from one single account and also a $32 million non-accrual out of our structured finance. ", "I assure you it\u2019s important to mention that non-accruals don\u2019t typically have full value losses, generally these are accounts that are supported by substantial collateral values. We try to maintain a very conservative policy with respect to non-accruals, so we don\u2019t just have accounts that have gone delinquent, but in fact accounts that we believe have a probability of not returning their footprints upon interest. In fact just as a note, of the $683 million that we have non-accruals in the second quarter, $400 million of those accounts are actually not delinquent. ", "The good news on the credit front was that our actual charge-offs were only $23 million versus $47 million in the first quarter. In the second quarter there is a loss of $99 million which reflected several things higher loss provisions, higher portfolio losses and securitization impairments. These were partially offset by $37 million gain on the early debt retirements.", "Loss provisions were $87 million. We increased our reserves by $64 million including one large $32 million structured finance account. Our portfolio losses were $50 million, this included $22 million in discount and pay offs from redistribution program. I think it\u2019s important to note, as we\u2019ve been going through these reductions, we are tackling some of the tougher assets to make sure that we do the right things here in terms of timing of these liquidations.", "The marine distribution program is a good example of that. Those $22 million in pay offs were incurred as we made a special program to clear out \u201807 and \u201808 boat inventory, on our basic belief that it\u2019s better to remove these older boats from the inventory now rather than wait for another season, were likely the assets will achieve even lower values. So in the marine portfolio, we started the year with $585 million. We finished the quarter at $300 million and these liquidations continue fairly strong into July as well. ", "So our success is not just been in boats, but across all of our distribution finance assets. In fact if we look at repossessed assets, they were actually reduced by $19 million in the quarter. This reflects our ability to take those repossessed assets and mark them accordingly and actually move those into the marketplace.", "Slide seven, I think is very important. If you look at our largest liquidations continue to be out of distribution of $800 million and our asset baseline business of $230 million. In the quarter, we did reach agreement with two of our private brand customers to move those relationships to other financial institutions. At the time we negotiated those arrangements, we have $320 million of receivables.", "These instruments allow us to forward funding to the new financial institution, and then we run off the balance of the receivables. Just to give you an idea, we signed those agreements in the beginning of June and have since been able to reduce that to $320 million by $50 million in June alone.", "We also had one portfolio sale in our ABL business, $109 million sale at a value that was consistent with the mark-to-market, when we put those assets into our held for sale account. In the golf business, we had 12 mortgage payoffs and then one of our owned golf courses sold in the quarter for a total value of about $50 million.", "Slide eight, as you look at all these liquidations receivables, you can see that our cash conversion rate in the quarter was 94% even with the discount programs, this is ahead of our expectations. We still expect the conversion rate will decline overtime, but we are certainly very encouraged by the results in the quarter.", "So, in summary, I\u2019d say that we continue to make excellent progress in terms of the rate of our liquidation and it demonstrates substantial collateral, liquidation value that we have in the portfolio and we believe strong cash conversion rates, for such aggressive liquidation.", "In summary, I want to talk about our restructuring program. We have announced that we are increasing the program charges in 2009 to $200 million from $75 million. This reflects some non-cash items, such as the Columbus and the pension curtailment programs, but also more aggressive reductions in terms of employees across the company and primarily incurring employee severance expenses. So, we will have a total headcount reduction associated program now through the balance of the year of about 10,000 people.", "So in summary, I think if you look at our businesses balance systems, continue to have a very strong performance. The TFC liquidations were ahead of schedule with strong cash conversion. Industrial business returning to profitability is a great sign of the strength that we have today in that business and the potential going forward, and also late in the quarter we did see early signs of stabilization in the business jet market. ", "So I don\u2019t think any of us are bullish at this stage of the game. I think the fact that it appears to be stabilizing boards well for the start of the beginning for the recovery. So, I think Q2 demonstrate we have the right programs to maximize both our operational efficiencies and cash generation and clearly we will continue to take those actions to improve the business going forward.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Scott. We\u2019ll wrap up today. I just want to point out that everybody that we have three additional slides. Slide number nine is the chart that lays out segment revenue and profitability forecast associated with our EPS guidance.", "Slide 10 contains our forecast for corporate items and then finally on slide 11 we have our quarter organic sales growth breakdown. So, Teddy with that, we\u2019re pleased to take calls at this time.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Steve Tusa - JP Morgan.", "Steve Tusa - JP Morgan ", "Just a quick question; on the longer term Cessna outlook, what would you expect under the assumption of a very muted recovery. I guess I\u2019m wonder what your longer term margin target would be for Cessna. Where would you be under a reasonable volume scenario? Where would you be kind of happy with the normalized type of margin number at Cessna?", "Lewis Campbell", "Steve, I think the recovery question is a tough one. We\u2019re still predicting that we\u2019ll have lover deliveries next year than we had this year, and that would be the bottom of the cycle and then you will start to see a recovery which obviously is going to be very hardly dependent on what the economy recovery look like.", "We think the margin rate for the total of this year is going to be somewhere in that 5% kind of range. Obviously our expectations are to try to sustain that or even grow that as we go into 2010 given somewhat lower volumes and then continue to see that growth and we get better leverage as volumes return to business going forward.", " Steve Tusa - JP Morgan ", "I guess my question, you\u2019re making these cost reductions, you must have some sort of view on even at lower volume levels what you want to do. I\u2019m trying to get a sense. Is it modestly above where it is today, is it double-digit. How should we think about a longer term? You guys must have that at the top of your mind, as you are making all theses moves on the cost side.", "Scott Donnelly", "Longer term, obviously we would expect this business to get back up into the mid teens where we\u2019ve seen it before where we had higher volumes. I think our expectations here in the next couple of years, again obviously this is highly volume dependent as things start to turn, but I have to say that we want to achieve better margins, but we are making substantial investment in the R&D of this business over the next couple of years.", "So, we have a lot of work yet to do frankly in terms of how we make sure that leveraging the base cost, the fix cost that we have in this business in terms of our manufacturing footprint and we\u2019ll need to continue to take more action there I believe, but we\u2019ll also have to be sensitive to the fact that we are at a unusually low volumes. We can\u2019t let that influence our R&D investment or we won\u2019t have the right products in the right places when the thing covers. ", "So I would expect Steve, you\u2019d see this thing come from the 5% and slowly grow back up towards those mid teens are we\u2019ve been in the past.", " Steve Tusa - JP Morgan ", "How many jets in the backlog now and what is the pricing like in that backlog? Is there any movement on the price of those jets?", "Scott Donnelly", "We haven\u2019t moved anything on the pricing, obviously as customers have come up with their deliveries. There\u2019s been discussion and we\u2019ve been trying to help some folks in terms of service something like that. We are trying to stay away from, much in the way of pricing. Obviously the Aircraft in the backlog were priced at the time the deals were done. So, we have contracts for that. Pricing is still up somewhat this year and we are going to try to hold that. ", "I don\u2019t think this is a market where this is all about pricing. This is really more about, where is the demand in the economic recovery and I think as we look at June, we actually saw some customers come in at reasonable price points even for 2009 deliveries for guys that went even in the backlog.", "Lewis Campbell", "Hi Steve its Lewis. Let me add just one more point to Scott\u2019s points. Out strategy at Cessna is rock solid and I think its very sound. ", "Remember it\u2019s under core or underpinning in two areas. One, to keep the Mustang selling at above 100 if you can, because what that does, is brings people into the fleet and our customer\u2019s fab numbers have never been better. So we know that once we get someone into Cessna, they\u2019re probably going to buy another one. Remember, our numbers used to be seven out of ten or repeat customers. So we\u2019ve got a flock of people now getting into the Cessna family, that\u2019s number one. ", "As Scott said, we\u2019re continuing to invest in new products and improved products so when this market comes back, I think we\u2019re going to be particularly well positioned to ride it up at a pretty good rate. So, I\u2019m not happy with the volume and where it is, but it is where it is and we just have to manage it carefully till the starts come back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Strauss - UBS.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Based on your manufacturing free cash flow forecast, it looks like you\u2019re expecting the second half to generate about $600 million. How does that break out between Q3 and Q4?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it\u2019s always a little bit back-end loaded, but you\u2019re probably somewhere in the one-third, two-thirds or 40/60 kind of range, David.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Could you give us an update of exactly what you\u2019re expecting in terms of debt pay down and the securitization in Q3 and Q4?", "Scott Donnelly", "David, I\u2019ll follow-up with you if you want to breakdown on the quarterly. I mean, we\u2019ll give you what\u2019s coming due contractually, but in terms of what we might do opportunistically, of course we\u2019re not going to discuss that publicly.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Then any additional color as far as you said the production rate, you\u2019re looking at lower deliveries in 2010, any additional color. It looks like on the ex Mustang, you\u2019re going to be down like the 150 range for 2009; is that going much lower in 2010 or just a little lower? Could you just help a little bit there?", "Scott Donnelly", "No Dave, I think it\u2019s probably too early to start calling the numbers on 2010. We\u2019ll know an awful lot more here in the next four, five months as this goes through what appears to be at least here in June and continues in July. Sort of stabilizing and seeing some customers coming back into the market, more customers taking delivery of their aircrafts. So I think we\u2019re seeing some positive trends, but I think we can be a lot more accurate in terms of our views of what\u2019s going in the market here in the coming few months.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Last one, on the used aircraft side, could you just tell us what you\u2019re holding in terms of inventory on the used aircraft side?", "Scott Donnelly", "In terms of numbers?", "David Strauss - UBS", "Yes, numbers and value or whatever detail you can give us?", "Scott Donnelly", "Right now we\u2019ve got about 48 aircrafts. We have about 38 that are Cessna inventory and about 10 that are citation share used aircraft inventory and that actually in terms of units went down a few in the second quarter as we were able to sell more used aircraft than we took in trade and so again, hopefully that\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ll see continue through the balance of the year.", "Lewis Campbell", "Dave, we\u2019re carrying them at just a little over $200 million, which represents a net of about $100 million in write-offs that we\u2019ve taken so far this cycle, so that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re expecting less of an impact from used in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague - Citigroup.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Scott, understanding that the non-accruals don\u2019t necessarily come through the charge-offs, would you expect charge-offs to be moving up in the back half of the year regardless and into next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I think there\u2019s going to be a general trend Jeff, as we work our way through this, that we\u2019ll see increased charge-offs and I think what we\u2019re doing right now is appropriate. We take the loss provisions and reserve is up consistent with our expectation, we still will start to see higher charge-offs somewhere in the third and fourth quarter and frankly going forward.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "You\u2019d also had indicated on the run-off you\u2019re actually trying to focus on some of the tougher stuff first, but the cash conversion actually looks pretty decent. What is it about what you see in the pipeline that might make you a little more cautious on the cash conversion looking out say six or 12 months?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we get into some of the asset classes, which when you look at resort, when you look at golf, again, I think not so much in the next quarter or two, but as you get further out, these are some of the larger accounts. There\u2019s not as much liquidity, let\u2019s say in some of those industries. ", "So, I think a lot what we\u2019ll do in distribution finance and ABL as capital is returning to the market. We see other financial institutions that are willing to take some of those accounts and we saw that for instance in a couple of those private brand accounts. So this is generally relatively good business and so I just think it\u2019s the first place that capital is returning.", "Now, we don\u2019t know yet exactly what\u2019s going to happen with some of these longer tail resorts. Obviously, the economy continues to strengthen, money keeps coming back into the market. We are hopeful that more capital will returns into some of those markets. If they do, then obviously we\u2019ll incur lower losses. ", "As we go through this and have to release some of those assets, if we don\u2019t have as much liquidity for instance, securitization and the timeshare resort kind of businesses, then we\u2019ll expect to see higher losses and therefore lower cash conversion rates than we\u2019ve seen on the shorter cycle, shorter tail receivables that we\u2019ve been running off so far.", "Jeff Sprague - Citigroup", "Understanding you don\u2019t want to go out on a lim on 2010 yet, I just wonder what the complexion of the conversations are maybe as you reach out to customers and it\u2019s time to start paying progress payment on 2010 perhaps. Are you seeing some slippage out there as people reconsider?", "Scott Donnelly", "The trend has been positive. Again, I try to couch this in saying this is a sort of a June and now into July phenomena that we are seeing more customers that are making their payment, that are taking their delivery of their aircraft as opposed to canceling it the last minute, but again it\u2019s a full month of June. The trend, it says continuing in July, but I think we still have some time here to play out to see whether truly it has stabilized and we\u2019ll start to see that kind of a trend going forward.", "Lewis Campbell", "But we are taking orders for delivery in 2010.", "Scott Donnelly", "Absolutely. The good news of what we\u2019ve seen is sort of interesting Jeff. It\u2019s almost like a spot market has sort of started. Actually, we have customers that were not in the backlog. These are guys that have sort of been on the sidelines that are now looking and saying, \u201cOkay, is this time the time to make the move.\u201d ", "So as Lewis mentioned, we\u2019ve got orders in June; seven that were for 2009 deliveries and we continue to get a few more in July. So these are actually customers not in the backlog that are kind of stepping in and taking 2009 and I think we are starting to see also interest in taking some slots in 2010 as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Kincaid - Davidson Kempner. ", "Scott Brugle - Davidson Kempner", "Hi, it\u2019s actually [Scott Brugle]. Can you guys just help me reconcile slide number five, the $1.282 billion of receivable liquidations? With the cash flow statement in the 8-K that was filed, it looks like you generated about $500 million in cash.", "Lewis Campbell", "Can you do that one again, Scott?", "Scott Brugle - Davidson Kempner", "Sure, the $1.3 billion of managed receivables decreasing with the cash flow statement for the second quarter that was filed in the 8-K, that showed 1.1 of receivables repaid, 745 of receivables originated.", "Scott Donnelly", "The primary difference is the difference between managed receivables and owned receivables. We present the managed receivables number here because we have to look at this from a total liquidity point of view, whereas the Q presents it on an owned basis. So those numbers will not match, but they do reconcile.", "Scott Brugle - Davidson Kempner", "So is the right way to think about that, you had about $700 million or so of receivables that were managed but not owned?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, 648 is the right number. We paid down $648 million of securitization debt in the quarter that came out of that $1.282 billion.", "Scott Brugle - Davidson Kempner", "Then my second question is, if you look at the golf balances, it looks like that decreased pretty significantly in the quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Golf, did you say?", "Scott Brugle - Davidson Kempner", "Golf, yes.", "Scott Donnelly", "We did have 12 payoffs and we did sell one, well, it\u2019s in other assets, because it was a known golf course. I\u2019d say we are seeing a fairly positive trend in the golf portfolio and I\u2019d say there\u2019s a number of customers out there. ", "People are interested in picking up golf courses, in the case those that we own and a positive trend I would say in folks that we talked to and said \u201cLook, when you come due or even as a prepayment, we\u2019d like to discount you to redo your mortgage somewhere else\u201d and people are doing it, at reasonable discounts.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "So the pre-owned losses equaled to the forfeitures in the second quarter, what was that number in the first quarter and can you also comment on the trend in R&D in the second quarter? Where was it relative to the first and where do you expect it to be for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Give us the first question again.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "The first question is I guess you indicated that pre-owned losses were $38 million and that was the same as forfeiture gains in the second quarter. Where was the net of those two numbers in the first quarter, that\u2019s the first part of that question?", "Scott Donnelly", "The pre-owned was about $13 million in the first quarter and the forfeitures I think was around the same number; I\u2019m looking that up. What was your second half of your question as we\u2019re looking at it?", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co.", "The second half is R&D; where was it in the first and second quarter and where do you expect it to be for the year?", "Lewis Campbell", "We\u2019d really rather not talk about specific R&D at Cessna that\u2019s competitively sensitive, but that\u2019s through the year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Let me trace the year out for you Cai. R&D last year was 553; this is total company. Cessna is always as a percentage of sales higher than anybody else, but that\u2019s just another point. ", "In January we thought that number should be a little bit south of 500 and we\u2019ve now firmed up everything, which take a lot of work actually to know where to invest to get the most bang for the buck and so we basically let Cessna kind of free flow back to us on where they thought they ought to invest in order to keep our products, not only new ones coming but also fresh in the fleet. ", "We\u2019ve now settled on total company R&D of 450. So, if you compare about 550 to 450 it\u2019s down about 20% which I think is about right, but keep in mind, don\u2019t under estimate my point, we didn\u2019t say \u201cOkay Cessna, instead of $10 you get $5.\u201d We said \u201cFree flow back to us. What do you need to freshen the fleet to make sure that we\u2019re as competitive as we need to be when the market comes back\u201d and we put that number in. Bell is the same way, Bell has got a good future there too from a competitive standpoint.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen And Company", "You mentioned the other seven orders in June went into the deliveries in 2009. If we get orders in July and August, presumably we will, will they go into 2009 or will they go into 2010?", "Scott Donnelly", "There\u2019s a mix. So we already have some that we are talking in July that would be 2009 aircraft and we have a number that want to slot 2010 deliveries. So really, the mix here is if you have a customer that really wants to take a 2009 delivery, they are willing to take the aircraft as configured or with minor modifications which is what\u2019s happening, we\u2019ll do that, but there are some customers that want to do a full custom configuration to their exact requirements and specifications and those are largely folks that will take a 2010 delivery.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen And Company", "So if some are going into 2009, should we take the 275 as the number that has upside?", "Lewis Campbell", "If you want to Cai, that\u2019s up to you. It\u2019s going to go up and down Cai. I mean we really choose our words, I did, choose my words on how to talk about this and I know Scott did too. ", "Look, for the first month in I don\u2019t know how long, nine months or thereabout, we\u2019re seeing a positive sign. They are not flashing green lights, but they are certainly a lot better than they\u2019ve been in months and months and we are basically sold out to deliver a little more than 275. We can get some more cancellations which would take the 275 down, but we could have net plus orders going forward and if we do that we would do more than 275, which we would love to do.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen And Company", "Last one, you hired an investment banker as a CFO as opposed to kind of a financial operating guy. Why did you make that decision?", "Scott Donnelly", "I\u2019m sitting across the table from a great financial operating guy. That\u2019s I think if you look at what\u2019s going on in the last six or nine months. Dick has done a phenomenal job and always has. He has a control over the company and really running the finance and working the numbers and working with the business CFO on a day-in day-out basis. So I think we have an outstanding talent in the company to run that day-in day-out finance operation. ", "We came across Frank and here\u2019s a guy that\u2019s got a lot of expertise and experience in both capital market kind of work and also in M&A kind of work. So I look at a guy like Frank and say \u201cThis is having the complimentary talents of what both already have and a very solid great operating financial arm in being able to bring in a talent,\u201d because obviously we still have work to do going forward in terms of the capital structure of the company.", "Ultimately, once we get all the stuff behind us and markets kind of get back to normal and the world moves on, having a Chief Financial Officer that\u2019s experienced and a savvy M&A kind of guy I think is the right talent to have in the company. So really that was an opportunity to bring somebody in that had very complimentary skills with the skills we already had in the company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Was the cancellation number in the second quarter excluding Columbus, if we add up everything you gave us, was it 169?", "Lewis Campbell", "We got the exact number, 243 minus 76.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it\u2019s 243 minus 76 where the number is, that\u2019s what it was.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "So I guess I\u2019m kind of struggling; if there was over 150 legacy cancellations in the quarter, I\u2019m kind of struggling with how the \u201809 number is only coming down by 20 aircrafts. If that kind of implies that they\u2019re not coming out of \u201809, you said you had order activity, but it\u2019s pretty modest. So, I know you guys are kind of reluctant to talk about ten, but does that imply that 2010 is at least what a bit worse than you had previously talked about with the down kind of 15%?", "Scott Donnelly", "No. I don\u2019t think so. I think what you\u2019re getting at is absolutely right. If you look at the cancellations that came out, again forget Columbus, which is obviously out in the 14, 15, 16 kind of timeframe, but the bulk of the other cancellations that we brought out in the quarter was really kind of going through and looking at large fleet/fractional customers. ", "So when you look at the nature of those kinds of orders that we took out in the order book, they do spread out in 10, 11, 12 and beyond. So we had one case with one large fraction guy, which actually normally wouldn\u2019t have been cancellation, but it\u2019s a model aircraft that we\u2019re just not going to be building in that timeframe, so we obviously took those out. ", "Then we had a couple of other fractional customers that we just don\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to be taking aircraft in the near future and we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate to have those orders sitting in the book. When we don\u2019t think there is a probability, we\u2019re going to realize them, so we worked with those customers and took them out of the book.", " ", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "So, either cancellations coming out of the next three or four years?", "Scott Donnelly", "Exactly, but there\u2019s a lot that are 11, 12 and beyond.", "Lewis Campbell", "Noah, if we\u2019re going to plan on getting our margins up, you have to have some kind of stability in predictable orders. So for example, if we\u2019re having a discussion with a large guy, who\u2019s got 24 jets on order, which was the one we did and we basically say \u201cHey guy, if you\u2019ve got a big doubt right now, we\u2019ll just soon pull you out. So we can plan on making whatever volume of that plane we want to plan on making.\u201d If he wants to comeback in later, great, but we\u2019re trying to get the book as predictable as possible. ", "Whenever the market comes back, the orders will come back and they\u2019ll comeback to us. So, it\u2019s not to our benefit to have a big order number that is not strong. So I think orders are less orders than we had, but I believe they are more certain than they were before so.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "How many Mustangs in the 275 number?", "Lewis Campbell", "125. That spreads over the long period of time.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "One more question on systems. The full year guidance implies that the second half growth really takes off, but the margin guidance kind of also implies that the second half margin is a lot weaker than the first half. Can you guys just walk through the puts and takes on that business for the rest of the year?", "Lewis Campbell", "We had kind of a big first quarter, but the third and the fourth quarters are pretty consistent with the second quarter Noah, nothing remarkable going on there.", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t see a lot of movement in terms of the margin ratio in the balance of the year.", "Lewis Campbell", "They vary between 10 and a little over 12 depending on the quarter, which ebbs and flows depending on what we\u2019re delivering as far as ASVs and what contracts expiring and VACs you book and which ones you don\u2019t. ", "Systems are hard to call quarter-after-quarter, because you\u2019re using contract or a lot of accounting in the sense that you have EACs which are based on how you price to the government and once you price it fixed price and the thing on how well you do against that fixed price, you make more money or less money and that accumulates until you know that you can book a higher profit rate and then that all flows in on a given month. ", "So the margins vary slightly, because of that fact, but I believe you\u2019ll see systems, probably at the end of the year end up in a very good place margin wise. Not quite as strong as last year, but pretty darn good.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Barclays.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Barclays", "Can you give us a feel for what do you think has enabled you to really track so far ahead on the liquidation plan and where are people finding alternative financing? Give us a little color on that.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that the nature of the assets that we\u2019re talking about, specifically in the distribution finance business; in fact the matter is people are actually buying boats and RVs and stuff like that. So that business is obviously as well collateralized, so we have the collateral of that asset that\u2019s been financed with the deal and dealer who sells it, and we get our money back. ", "We put a lot of feet on the street in terms of people checking accounts and make sure that when an asset is sold, that we do get our money back. Again, I think the fact that other folks have been stepping into that and picking up some of these accounts and financing these dealers, by and large has allowed them to stay whole. ", "Obviously, some dealers have gone bankrupt. When they do that, we\u2019re frequently debt re-possessing those assets, but again, I think we saw that re-possessing kick-in in the first quarter and it continues in the second quarter, but we\u2019ve actually been able to take those assets and mark them, turnaround and sell through alternative distribution channels and actually get them sold off. So we actually saw a net reduction in that class in the quarter. ", "So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything pretty good magic about it. It\u2019s just blocking and tackling and out there letting dealers know that we\u2019re not financing any more and in the case of the private brand\u2019s customers, we\u2019ve been working with those customers to jointly go help find them; someone to take over that relationship and we\u2019ve been successful in a number of cases of doing that.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Barclays", "Obviously, I don\u2019t think RV sales or boat sales were probably better than your internal plan, so if maybe, were you pleasantly surprised that all by your ability that find other people to lend to these customers?", "Lewis Campbell", "Not really. I mean actually if you look at classes like boats and RV, it actually has been ahead of our plan. So I mean though the number of turns in these deals of inventories, is lower than it has historically been, but they are still moving assets.", "Again, in terms of these private brand relationships, these typically are relationships where not only do you have the collateral of the value of the asset, but in many occasions you have manufacturing take-back provisions and these are good manufacturers, they\u2019re creditable companies. So they are historically accounts that do pretty well. So even in distressed time, as people are looking to put capital to work, we see people coming into this space.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Barclays", "Then on the jumps in the non-accruals, can you flush that out a little bit more about the recovery dynamics and what you\u2019re expecting to happen there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, the class of asset that exists the most and again these judgments in terms of non-accrual, where we have a belief that we may not get our full principal interest back as we look at the resort class, that\u2019s the one that added the most to the non-accrual, because it\u2019s the one that for us is most uncertain in terms of how that industry plays out.", "Again I would say, that\u2019s reflective of the fact that unlike some of these other assets where we do see our capital coming back into these areas, we remain concern on areas like time shares that have historically been dependent on doing a lot of securitization to finance their operations. Until that securitization market comes back, we\u2019re going to need to hold and manage our way through some of these customers. ", "So I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the biggest add in the quarter in terms of non-accruals and frankly that\u2019s where I would expect to see. Going forward, most of our increases in non-accrual will come from that portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ron Epstein - BOA.", "Ron Epstein - BOA", "Just a couple of quick ones; one for Scott, you mentioned that you guys have laid-off about 10,000 employees. How far do you think that deep enough is? I just what I\u2019m trying to say is, when the economy does turn, how can you be prepared that you maybe didn\u2019t let too many people go or you\u2019re not prepared when things turn?", "Scott Donnelly", "That is something we try to be very helpful about as we look at all the businesses. We have tried where possible and a number of our industrial businesses, Cessna is another good example and we\u2019ve done some with Bell. When we reach that point, where we worry that if went leaner than that, we would have a hard time responding as the market starts to come back. ", "In a number of those businesses we\u2019ve actually used furloughs. So instead of taking a further reduction in the permanent number of employees, we actually shut Cessna for instance for a month. Furloughed all of our workforce and basically shut the factory. Obviously we\u2019re doing customer deliveries and support, but we basically shut the production lines down for a month, because we felt like that was a more prudent thing to do to protect our capability as things start to come back.", "We\u2019ve done similar things in Bell and across and virtually all of our industrial businesses and we\u2019ll continue to try to do that frankly to modulate demand going forward with furloughs to the extent that we can, but I think we had to be realistic about some of the businesses like Cessna, in terms of what\u2019s the relate of recovery and when you think it\u2019s going to be a longer, flatter recovery, then we\u2019ve had to take those permanent actions in terms of [Inaudible].", "Ron Epstein - BOA", "Then I guess another one on Cessna, if I can. I don\u2019t think anybody asked this one yet. When we look at whitetails, what\u2019s the outlook on whitetails for this year going into next; how\u2019s that gone? You had some I think last quarter and how does it look now?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well we have been accumulating. As we said before, the first quarter and second quarter we did build at let\u2019s say an accelerated pace, because we had all the material coming in. We had the workforce in place and the most optimal thing in our view is to go ahead and build the aircraft. So we\u2019ve been doing that.", "So, I think if you look at classification, of inventory, even though Cessna has been going up, we actually moved that inventory. We went from rolling and process to work to now moving into finished goods and that manifest itself as these whitetails, which now we expect start to believe that number back over the third quarter and the fourth quarter.", "How far that goes, it kind of goes back to our earlier discussions we had around how many customers do step-up to place 2009 orders and how many people stay in the backlog that are current in 2009 deliveries. When we get do that, the 275 kind of number, that\u2019s the base plan that we are working around and that assumes obviously that we are working down the number of whitetails that came out of the second quarter versus what we have at the end of the year.", "Doug Wilburne", "The way to think about it is not so much where we are now, where are we at the end of \u201909, but where are we at the end of 2010? And our plan is to have none by the end of 2010. We are basically managing a two year demand window here as well. ", "Scott Donnelly", "Right, absolutely. To Doug\u2019s point, when I say we stabilized our production rate for \u201809 and \u201910, when we look at deliveries in \u201909 and \u201910, we take into consideration those whitetails that we would assume we have at the end of \u201809. Those all sell off.", "Ron Epstein - BOA", "How many do you have today?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t think we want to put that information out there, just from a competitive standpoint.", "Ron Epstein - BOA", "Then I have a question for Lewis. Having lived through this horrible economy, and you look at how you\u2019ve been leading Textron, what have you learned? When you kind of look forward, what have you learned on how you would run the company different, having lived through this?", "Lewis Campbell", "That\u2019s a tough question. When we went through 2001, 2002 and 2003, remember our stock went down to 26 and if you do a [Inaudible] which was just a very dramatic thing for the company, we launched a very significant transformation effort which was uncertain as to whether or not it was going to work, but we felt it was the only thing that we could do and a chance of working it and it really did work.", "Now, so we have the benefits of that. We are network enterprise. We do so many things better than we did. So one thing we\u2019ve learned is that what we\u2019ve put in place in the one, two, three, that first part of this decade, is really saving our bacon, even though when you look at our EPS and cash flow you say \u201cGosh, you could be doing better.\u201d You take a little cash flow for example and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we are now doing a much better job of turning in manufacturing free cash flow; thanks to Scott and Dick and all the guys working on that.", "I wish we made the cut sooner. It\u2019s so tricky based on the question that just got asked, how do you know you\u2019re not cutting too far? We should have done these cuts six months ago, but in hindsight that\u2019s crystal clear and I guess everybody that\u2019s ever had to make cut out, we cut over 8,000 people this year already. I wish we would have done it sooner, but we just did it in chunks. ", "So, I learned that the hard way again. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll ever learn it permanently, maybe Scott will learn it from me and the next time it happens he\u2019ll move more quickly than we both did. ", "On the positive side I\u2019ve learned that people will do unbelievably heroic things that are very contrary to what you think they\u2019d do. You take TFC, they\u2019re making money for decades and decades and then grow, grow, grow, grow and basically have the same outlet for the same people primarily inline, are now totally focused on running off the very businesses they put in place and what motivated people to do that is just amazing. ", "So, I think the fact that people are aligned to drive Textron profitability ahead of their own unique side of the businesses is quite testimony. I wish we\u2019ve been smart enough not to have such a big TFC, I sure learned that, but that\u2019s something you can\u2019t really know until you get into this financial crisis.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "", "I was wondering if you could just comment quickly on what this co-line is all about, $410 million seems like a significant amount of money.", "Lewis Campbell", "What was your question about it?", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "What is it all about; it seems like a very large amount of money.", "Scott Donnelly", "In the fourth quarter we borrowed against insurance policies, corporate owned life insurance policies that we had in place, which are available and I say borrowed it. It\u2019s technically an advance on an asset and you have to pay an interest on the advance, and so given that we\u2019ve improved our liquidity so significantly we were able to pay that down and as Lewis mentioned, that\u2019s still available to us where we had to get into a situation where we need to tap back into it.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "What was the interest rate on that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Like around 7%, 6% or so. It was 6% non-tax deductible.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Macquarie", "Right. And that\u2019s now caved down to zero?", "Scott Donnelly", "I believe so. ", "Okay, thank you very much ladies and gentlemen.", "Lewis Campbell", "Thank you everyone. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice-President, Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thank you Rachel and good morning everyone. Before we begin I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s President and CEO and Frank Connor, Textron\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Moving now to fourth quarter\u2019s results which appear on slide 3 of the earnings call presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.8 billion, down 21% from a year ago which yielded a GAAP loss of $0.23 per share. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, excluding special charges were $0.15 per share, down from $0.37 a year ago.", "We recorded fourth quarter pretax special charges of $114 million. This included an $80 million charge to reflect impairment of goodwill at our Golf and Turf Care businesses. The impairment reflects our expectation of a slower recovery in these markets than previously anticipated. The remaining $34 million of special charges were associated with our restructuring program.", "For the year, manufacturing operations provided $424 million of cash flow compared to our target of $300 million to $400 million. This included a $132 million in manufacturing restructuring cash outflows. And with that I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank you, Doug. Good morning everyone. I think we\u2019ve brought a solid close to what for us has clearly been a challenging year. We have faced volume challenges throughout the year, ultimately delivering 289 [Jet numbers]\t to 467 in 2008. Our industrial volumes finished the year approximately 29% below the 2008 level and obviously in our financial services market, we faced too many of the same challenges that the financial industry has faced across the board.", "I guess what I would like to do at this point is focus on the actions we\u2019ve taken and how we take our company forward. In response to the challenging financial markets, we decided and announced early in the year to exit the non-captive finance businesses at TFC and I think our team has made a very good progress in executing the strategy. We\u2019ve also taken a number of actions to reduce overhead and restructuring actions to match our production to the actual market demands.", "From late 2008 through 2009, this resulted in a headcount reduction of over 10,000 people, almost one quarter of our work force. And all these actions have been difficult for our company and for our employees. I do believe we created a cost structure that should allow us to leverage volumes as market returns.", "We have been focused on cash generation throughout the year, particularly with respect to working capital improvements primarily related to inventory. These programs have yielded real results as inventories were down $820 million. We have made a number of important capital structure changes to strengthen our balance sheet and we\u2019ve restored access to the public capital market as we demonstrated through new term debt, convertible debt and equity offerings.", "By the end of the year, we reduced our net debt, including securitizations by over $4 billion. And while we are not finished, I think we are on track to have a capital structure over the next couple of years which support a solid investment grade rating for manufacturing company with a relatively modest captive finance business. So let\u2019s discuss each of the segments in detail.", "In finance, as we mentioned earlier, our team at TFC, did a perfect job of shifting the focus from portfolio growth to liquidation and cash conversion. We reduced our managed receivables by $3.8 billion, compared to our initial 2009 goal of $2.6 billion. And we did this as you can see on slide 4 with high cash conversion with 94% for both, the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2009.", "Slide 5 shows our full breakdown by portfolio, as you see the large reduction of $2.3 billion was in our distribution finance portfolio. As we look forward to 2010, we\u2019re targeting a further reduction of $1.6 billion bringing our two year target to $5.4 billion. That\u2019s $900 million higher than our original target of $4.5 billion. We are also upto a good start of 2010 as we recently completed the transfer of another private brand [four] plan account which included both the forward-funding commitments and the current receivables.", "As we begin to liquidate an increasing proportion of our golf course and our resort portfolios, and properties this year, we would expect a different mix also in our remaining distribution finance asset, so in total we are expecting a cash conversion ratio of somewhere in the mid 80s. This is well within our five-year liquidation plan which we discussed earlier. In the business jet market, environment remains difficult but stable and we believe that we will begin to see improvement in order flow through the second half of the year.", "In the meantime, we did have a $1.7 billion in cancellations for the quarter primarily driven by a single large customer account as we announced late last year. On the order front, we did see a pickup in activity as we had 32 gross orders in the quarter compared to 38 for the first three quarters combined. New Citation aircraft available for sale continued to decrease and in the year at 15.4% down from a peak of 17.3%.", "Used pricing was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but we are seeing more examples of planes being sold above prevailing rates. Usage on Cessna aircraft also increased slightly to 0.66 hours from 0.65 in the previous quarter. We delivered 68 jets this quarter which for the total year as I mentioned at 289 including 125 Mustangs. This contributed a strong cash flow assessment in the fourth quarter.", "So as we look forward to 2010 we are targeting about 225 jet deliveries including 105 Mustangs and a much improved cash flow outlook. We currently have order for about 70% of the delivery plan. We expect to see low first quarter order rates as the number of the fourth quarter activities were driven primarily by tax incentive buyers, but we would expect that order rate to pick up throughout the course of the year.", "With additional order activity we saw in the fourth quarter, we have actually increased our production plan slightly from where we had initially set it back in July timeframe. In the meantime, we continue to work on ways to reduce our costs including consolidation facilities and moving certain activities to lower cost countries.", "In industrial segment, volumes were down 8% in the quarter, however our improved cost structure led to a $42 million increase in the segment profit despite the fact that revenues were down $26 million. The segment also generated a strong cash flow over 3.5 times segment profit. Looking to 2010, we are expecting a modest topline growth in the segment led by strong sales of Kautex.", "We saw automotive volume increase in the fourth quarter and the consensus view in the auto industry is to continue to see that growth throughout 2010. The sales growth should generate a significant improvement in profits in our industrial segment.", "Systems also had another strong quarter, sales were up nearly 11% from a year ago and we posted 13% margins. This growth is driven primarily by a diverse array of products we are producing, critically supporting our troops in today\u2019s regional conflicts. We will talk more on our February 9 Analyst Day, but we clearly see more opportunities for future growth in this business as increasingly we look to foreign military entities for demand in this business.", "Bell also had a good quarter which capped up a very solid year of operational execution. We delivered six V-22s bringing our full year total to 20. We delivered four H1s for a total of nine last year. We delivered all 29 of these military aircrafts ahead of schedule despite the six week labor disruption. In the quarter, we also delivered 50 commercial units bringing the total year number to 153.", "While revenues were flat for the year, we boosted margins into double digits and we significantly increased our cash flow. 2009 was also an important year for Bell because we began to work [necessary] to support substantial growth over the next several years. For example in the commercial side we received certification of our new 429 light twin and started production processes of our 25 planned deliveries for this year going to 50 in 2011. We also ramped up our V-22 and H1 lines to deliver 28 V-22s and 20 H1s in 2010. Those backlog increased $1.3 billion in the quarter primarily reflecting the next installment of V-22 multi-year funding.", "So we ended the year with a $6.9 billion backlog. Clearly growth is going to be very solid for Bell going forward. So in summary I would say we had a good quarter as we finished a year of transition. Looking forward, we still are going to continue our focus on cash generation and further reducing our debt and enhancing our liquidity and capital position. We still have work to do at Cessna on our costs, but we have seen the market stabilize and we do expect improvement as the economy progresses.", "Leverage will increase as we see more volume coming through our industrial business and systems has a steady outlook for growth. And as I said Bell we believe is in the first of several years of significant growth driven by our backlog particularly in our military product lines. Across the board, we certainly expect to continue to invest in new products and services that are critical to future business growth. With that I would like to turn it over to Frank to go through some of the details.", "Frank Connor", "Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with the major factors that drove the $0.22 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS which are outlined on slide 6 of the earnings presentation deck. As you would expect the largest driver was lower manufacturing volume which reduced EPS by $0.63. Taxes reduced earnings by $0.10 primarily as a result of the foreign tax credit benefit from the repatriation of foreign cash during last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "Higher share count and interest expense cost $0.05. And inflation rate of 1.2% cost $0.07 per share, slightly up raising pricing of $0.06 which reflected a rate of 1%. On the positive side, overall cost performance including lower SG&A and lower used aircraft losses benefited the quarter by $0.43. And TFC\u2019s lower operating loss contributed $0.14 on a year-over-year basis. Now let\u2019s look at the results for each of the segments starting with Cessna.", "Cessna\u2019s revenues decreased $642 million from the fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting lower volumes across the board. Cessna\u2019s segment profit decreased $170 million due to lower sales volume which was partially offset by favorable cost performance. The favorable cost performance included lower selling and administrative expenses largely due to workforce reductions in 2009, the benefit of forfeiture income from order cancellations and a decrease in writedowns of pre-owned aircraft inventory.", "The absolute impact of used aircraft for adjustments was minimal for this quarter. Cessna\u2019s backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $4.9 billion, a decline of $2 billion from the third quarter.", "Moving to Bell, Bell\u2019s revenue decreased $51 million due to lower sales volume partially offset by higher pricing. Bell\u2019s segment profit decreased $10 million due to the lower volume and a change in the commercial helicopter product mix partially offset by higher pricing.", "At Textron Systems, revenue increased $49 million due to higher defense volumes which were partially offset by lower aircraft engine volumes. Segment profit increased $8 million again due to higher defense volumes, partially offset by the lower aircraft volume. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, down $183 million from the third quarter.", "Looking at the industrial segment, revenue decreased $26 million due to lower volume and lower pricing partially offset by a favorable foreign exchange impact. The industrial segment profit increased $42 million, due to the improved cost performance partially offset by lower volume and pricing. Our cost performance reflected workforce reductions, employee furloughs, temporary plant shutdowns and lower selling and administrative expenses.", "Results at the finance segment reflected continuing financial challenges among our customers and the execution of our liquidation strategy. Looking at slide 7, 60 day plus delinquencies of finance receivables held for investment increased to $569 million from $440 million at the end of the third quarter. Non-accrual finance receivables increased to $1.04 billion from $838 million last quarter.", "Charge-offs were $22 million compared to $23 million for the third quarter bringing total 2009 charge-offs to $115 million. Loss reserves ended the year at $341 million. In addition to loss reserve, the mark-to-market valuation allowance at the end of the year was $185 million. Collectively the loss reserve and valuation allowance reflects 7.6% of managed receivables.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our 2010 outlook. Looking at slide 8, we expect our EPS from continuing operations before special charges will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.50 per share based on a fully diluted share count of about 300 million shares. We expect that restructuring charges primarily for Cessna will cost about $30 million pretax or $0.06 per share on an after-tax basis.", "We are anticipating a strong year on the cash front with manufacturing free cash flow of between $500 million and $550 million. A quick point on pension, we are estimating 2010 pension expense will be about $155 million which is about $65 million higher than our 2009 expense.", "Now let\u2019s move to our segment detail on slide 9. Our outlook at Cessna is based on reaching the 225 deliveries target that Scott mentioned. We expect deliveries to be lower in the early part of the year and build throughout the year. Specifically, we are planning for 30 to 35 deliveries in the first quarter which will result in a segment loss for the quarter. As volumes recover through the balance of the year, we expect margins will follow accordingly. As we previously indicated, we expect full year margins at Cessna in the low-single digits.", "At Bell, our military ramp is expected to drive an overall increase in revenues of about 16%. Our margin expectation in the 10% to 10.5% range reflects increased military mix, higher pension costs and higher R&D. At Textron Systems, we are expecting mid-single digit revenue growth, primarily reflecting growth in unmanned aircraft systems and intelligent battlefield products.", "We are projecting margins will compress slightly to a range of 11% to 12% as program lots are completed and the favorable productivity performance is rolled into forward contracts. For the industrial segment, we are anticipating an overall revenue growth rate of 6% and margins in the range of 3% to 4% as we get volume leverage from our improved cost structure.", "Moving to our finance segment. As Scott discussed, we expect to liquidate about $1.6 billion of finance assets during the year and we are estimating a 2010 pretax loss in a range of around $250 million. I would note that these levels are fully consistent with our liquidation plan. So that concludes our prepared remarks for today. We look forward to providing more color at our Analyst Day on February 9 and operator we are now ready to take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Scott, can you tell us a little bit about expected trends in R&D at Cessna for 2010 and I guess you mentioned that used aircraft losses and forfeitures were about offset, but if we could have those numbers for the 4th quarter, that would be great.", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, I can you give you some color on the Cessna on R&D, we are increasing R&D spending next year and obviously considerably as a percent of sales and it\u2019s focused primarily at our core light to mid -size aircraft. So we have a number of programs going and it\u2019s been sort of a gamut of update, block point type changes to a even a couple of aircraft that ultimately we would envision as new entries into the family of our products at Cessna.", "So, we don\u2019t have anything at this point that we would be publicly announcing. Obviously, we wouldn't do that for each of the given model types until we thought it was the right time commercially to announce those new products in the market. But there will be a significant trend and particularly with respect to a percent of sales of R&D spending.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "What are the rules you are going to look to in terms of when you would expect to announce those products?", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, as you know when you announce a new product, it usually generates a pretty strong order flow and so really the gauge that we have to use as we go through the course of the year for each model type is understanding what the receptiveness is going to be out there in the market place.", "So in other word, we don't want to announce, a new upgrade or block point change or a new aircraft if we don't think there\u2019s going to be a reasonable level of commercial demand out there, again I think we saw some strength in the level of orders in the fourth quarter.", "I would say generally speaking, we do feel a higher level of interest, more inquiries y across the board in terms of new aircraft, but until we really feel pretty confident that there is going to be a strong receptivity, we wouldn't announce a new aircraft in the market.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Can you talk a little bit on Cessna, how much are you sold out in 2010 vis-\u00e0-vis the deliveries that you have given us and also talk a little bit about the mix?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Heidi. The sold-out slots are approximately 70% going into the year. I don't know if there\u2019s a whole lot of variation as we go through the different models, obviously there is some, but in terms of our view of the strength of the plan, it\u2019s pretty consistent across the various models, but in general it\u2019s about 70%.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "What\u2019s the update on the [white tails], where do you stand as of year end there.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, with the white tails, we ended up delivering about 14 of them through the fourth quarter, more than we expected. So, we have about a similar number as we look into next year and obviously we consider that as part of the delivery forecast for next year 225s that we would liquidate all those, the balance of that white tails through the course of the year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to just dive into Bell a little further. Can you tell us what kind of military growth versus commercial growth you are looking for in '10. And maybe you touched on the margin a little bit, but you are guiding to margin compression here. Why not better with the V-22 ramp coming in?", "Doug Wilburne", "First of all, on the mix of military and commercial, it kind of follows more or less with the unit forecast that we gave in the prepared remarks.", "Scott Donnelly", "So military is going to be a bigger contributor to that growth given as Doug said that unit mix. And that mix shift to military is one of the reasons that you are seeing the margin impact, that the military business has lower margins than the commercial business and the margins on V-22 continue to come up, are doing quite well, but it\u2019s that mix shift.", "Doug Wilburne", "And it\u2019s primarily on the H1 because we are still in a very low single digit [blocks] on that program.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, if you looked at the margin on V-22 is I would say at this point a very healthy military margin business. so we\u2019re going to expect that to be sort of high single digit kind of numbers.H1 which has you know historically for us in the early lots was actually a negative margin program at one time and that is strengthening but and I would expect it overtime, we will get it up to be a healthy margin business.", "It will be positive for us next year, but from the mixed perspective as we ramp that volume is the lead one on margin and the other issue that we have is we have a brand new launch of the 429.", "And unfortunately and typically, a lot of these commercial programs, that one is not at the cost position that we would like it to be right now. But clearly it\u2019s the very beginning of a learning curve. So ultimately I would say that would be a good margin, a very successful product for us, but it is going to be dilutive as we introduce the first 25 next year.", "Doug Wilburne", "And similar to Cessna we are ramping up R&D as well as we look forward to new model introductions on the future.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "If I think a little longer term and I\u2019m going out beyond 2010 and you\u2019ve got all those programs continuing to ramp in the commercial business recovery and maybe the mix going back the other way. Can you maybe frame what kind of longer-term margin goal we could have here, could this be in the mid teens?", "Scott Donnelly", "Mid teens would be tough, just because we are going to have for the next three or four years as V-22 continues to grow. As H-1 continues to grow. Again I think if you think about those businesses, those product lines they are going to be strong, high single digit margin businesses. Clearly as the market recovers and you see more utilization that will help drive our commercial service business which is good margin business and we would need to get the margins improving on 429.", "So, I think the way to think about it is that we will have higher and higher mix shifting towards the military on V-22 and H-1, but the recovery on the commercial side of the business in both service and cost performance would kind of offset that growth and so we think we can we can hold these margins in the kind of guidance that we are giving you at this point as we look over the next two or three years. ", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS. Please go ahead.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Scott and Frank, when would you expect to see a turn in the non-accruals and the delinquencies at TFC turn lower?", "Scott Donnelly", "Obviously we would like to think this is kind of plateauing at this point. The reality is of course as you look at the non-accrual is that the team is working very hard and I think we always have to keep in mind this is a liquidating portfolio right. So everyone of these accounts, whether it\u2019s in non-accrual or not a non-accrual or worse delinquency is getting a lot of a pretty direct attention in terms of the path forward via restructuring activity, a sales activity.", "So we are working through these things sort of hand-to-hand combat, if you will regardless of whether it\u2019s non-accrual or not. I think what\u2019s important to note is that regardless of the non-accrual status, be it there because of delinquency or be it there because of our judgment that over the long-term we don\u2019t think we will get full principal interest back, that this is all still well within the context of what we showed you guys in terms of the alternate liquidation of TFC i.e. the losses that we guided you towards and we presented and obviously we will give you an update to go through the full details again in the Analyst Day on the 9. That this all falls within that. So there is no material change to our view of what the ultimate total losses are going to be as we liquidate this portfolio.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Okay and then with your guidance today, does it imply any change to your forecast by segment for 2013. The growth rates you had given out for 2013 specifically looking at the defense business and systems, it looks like that\u2019s a little bit light in terms of the guidance.", "Scott Donnelly", "From our growth perspective?", "David Strauss - UBS", "So D&I systems, you laid out any 10% growth forecast out for 2013 and relative to that kind of ramp, the guidance looks a little bit light on the sales side for 2010.", "Scott Donnelly", "Again this is one we will probably give you more information when we do the Analyst Day, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge change.", "Frank Connor", "I think at that time we indicated that most of those numbers were kind of backend loaded, certainly on the commercial side and I think that applies at Systems as well. So as Scott says, it\u2019s really not a big departure.", "David Strauss - UBS", "Your cash restructuring spend, what was that in 2009, what are you looking at for 2010?", "Scott Donnelly", "About $50 million.", "David Strauss - UBS", "For 2010?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Barclays Capital", "First on the restructuring you mentioned for 2010, the $30 million mostly at Cessna, can you give us a sense of kind of the big things you are going after there that are left to do, to the extent you can.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, the vast majority of that money is driven by the move of our Columbia storage facility to Mexico and also some of our back shop activity, facilities in Wichita and in Mexico.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Barclays Capital", "Then on finance, can you give a little sense of what the environment is like out there in terms of alternative lenders or people interested in parts of this portfolio. You took some of the securitization back on in the quarter, started to unload it, give us a feel for what you are seeing out there.", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s evolving obviously across the different asset classes, Shannon, the fact that we have done another movement with the private label or the private financing where we took, both the forward funding obligation as well as all the current receivables shows that there are more companies coming back into that space.", "So we saw a series of those transactions over the course of 2009, particularly late in 2009 and now at the beginning of 2010.", "So there clearly are more banks and financial institutions now that are wanting to move back into the space. There is yet to be seen as you think about the golf and the resort. Those are very different assets. We did see some securitizations that were done by some companies in the timeshare space in the latter part of 2009. So there is some money starting to come back into that. I think that\u2019s very much something that we will watch closely as we go through the course of 2010.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Barclays Capital", "As you are thinking about the conversion going down to the mid-80s and how do you expect that to proceed, is this you know people prepaying earlier or actually exiting parts of the portfolio in bigger chunks, how do you see that. What\u2019s envisioned in going down to the mid-80s on cash conversion.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think if you looked at 2009 where an awful lot of the liquidation came out of the distribution finance business. While we did some discount programs to move some of the assets, an awful lot of those assets moved apart. As people sold things as foreplanned and they were all collateralized and we got our money at par. So you had a mix that allowed us to keep in that mid 90s kind of range.", "As you look at more golf, you look at more resort, I think those were assets where we will do more discounting for someone to go refinance somewhere else or in some cases there might be, we anticipate people coming and saying, hey they would like to buy that asset in which case we would expect that would be something that we would do with some degree of discount associated with it.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "On the Cessna side, how many Mustangs are in the Q1 and for the full year?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s 105 for the full year, Steve and we haven't broken out the exact mix on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But it\u2019s pretty uniform across the year.", "Frank Connor", "Yes, it\u2019s a little lighter than uniform in the first quarter given kind of the low volume in the fiscal quarter, but the first quarter, a higher Mustang mix than the other quarters.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Okay and then just price cost in the fourth quarter, from Cessna, how is pricing holding up there?", "Scott Donnelly", "We were ever so slightly positive on the comparison.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. On the used side, as we said, we there was no kind of used writedown.", "Scott Donnelly", "We are still trying to be cautious obviously because it\u2019s a fairly commercially sensitive area, but we\u2019ve been hanging in there on the price side.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "And then one more question, you have a 1Q loss at Cessna. How about the second quarter, you limit your losses to the first half here and then does that ramp up in the second half or is it pretty linear from the first quarter to get to that modestly positive margin through the rest of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Let\u2019s talk about that at the end of the fiscal quarter after we get a better sense for how things are going volume wise because obviously it is going to depend on the volume. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "A couple of quick questions. One, can you just walk us through a little bit about the debt reduction that took place in the fourth quarter. Specifically it looks you know TFC had some bonds that came due, but it looks like you paid back a little bit more. Is that securitizations or what is the number of the debt reduction side, at both the [Ink] and the Finco. Did you pay any bank debt back. That's the question.", "Frank Connor", "No, we have not reduced the bank debt.", "Scott Donnelly", "We did have a securitization that we paid off in full in the fourth quarter that would have amortized into this year. So there was if you think of it as a prepayment in that sense on a securitization.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "Okay so it\u2019s all no-bank debt reduction. And then as you are looking at the line down on the portfolio, and you are saying you are going to come down closer to that mid to high 80s. Are you assuming a certain percent is just run off and a certain percent is potential just sales of the portfolio, can you give us any color on what\u2019s behind that assumption with that because it sounds like in the recent past you really weren\u2019t counting on much in the way of outright liquidation to sales of the portfolio in 2010 and that maybe 2011, 2012 you could have that, but can you just give us some color there.", "Frank Connor", "That\u2019s not changed and we do still expect the vast majority of the 2010 liquidation to come from runoffs. And we do kind of as you alluded to and we look at each one of the portfolios. So we make assumptions around what losses we are likely to encounter in terms for instance the balance of distribution advancements, which still has an awful lot of liquidation in 2010, but then we looked at more coming from golf, we would expect to see larger discounting to get people to refinance those properties.", "So, it is very much a mix of that, but generally speaking we still expect to be holding to the strategy that we had which was the 2010 will be predominantly a year where it\u2019s more runoff, but I think there will be higher loss associated with some of the balance of what we have with distribution and finance and we\u2019ve always assumed that we would have higher discounting or losses associated with things like the golf mortgage portfolio.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "Last one related to TFC with the [XM Financing], if you could just update us on of the $500 million, how much you\u2019ve utilized and there\u2019s just been some stories out talking about potential for other types of options at the XM bank where they could offer guarantees to customers and so forth similar to what they have done with Boeing. Is there any opportunity for additional financing options offered by XM?", "Frank Connor", "Sure, at year end, the number at XM was about $180 million. And we have a very good relationship with XM and this program has gone extremely well. We have regular dialogue with them and others about other financing alternatives. We are hopeful that we will in fact be able to get additional capacity out of XM over time. Our XM facility is structured differently than what XM has traditionally done where they have done for specific asset. This is in fact the facility and so we\u2019ve already kind of moved with them to a different nature of a relationship than they have historically done and we would expect to kind of continue with the structure because it\u2019s working well for us and it\u2019s working well for them.", "Scott Donnelly", "This XM structure which as Frank said it works very well for us and we are very, very happy with it. It is different than what you typically see with [Boeing] where these are very large ticket kind of transaction. This has been set up as a facility that fits better with our line of business which is more of a flow, relatively speaking smaller tickets and a lot of different customers, now that [recourse] obviously comes back to us.", "But it\u2019s proven to be very, very effective for us in the international markets and I think it works well for XM in terms of achieving the goals. We are not concerned frankly about getting to a point here where we don't have enough capacity into the XM line to support what we think is required for us in terms of international financing.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "Credit guarantees were about let\u2019s say a third party bank could lend, whoever buys the jet and then they backstop that. There\u2019s been chatter that that could be an option for business jets and helicopters that XM would pursue something like that. Is that anything you\u2019ve heard or that could be in the works or no?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we\u2019ve heard and talked about it and I think that\u2019s driven by the fact that other people, other manufacturers obviously would like to have some ability to access XM financing. But given that they don't have a financial service business, it\u2019s trickier in terms of how you do that. So we\u2019ve heard those things and frankly that would be great if that existed. We don\u2019t have a third party financing in there rather than us doing it, but these things aren\u2019t easy because on a transaction-by-transaction basis, that\u2019s a lot of work to you know provide a $10 million financing whereas the facility we have set up with XM is pretty efficient, it\u2019s more amenable to the kind of flow of a series of relatively small financings.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, all right. I was just thinking of having from the credit side because credit side rather see less debt right, because when you borrow from XM, it\u2019s still debt.", "Scott Donnelly", "If such a facility was put in place where there was a way of doing it, that would be terrific but it\u2019s not something that being in place or not being in place doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on us right now because we do have the existing XM.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein, Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Elizabeth for Ron. I just wanted to follow up on Heidi's question regarding the Cessna filled out orders for the year. It\u2019s 70% of the 225 anticipated deliveries are sold out, what percentage of those are Mustangs?", "Scott Donnelly", "You know, we are not providing that. It awfully commercially sensitive to us frankly to give too much data around each of the particular models with respect to either available or pricing. So I think we would probably like to stay away from that level of detail.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Question from the line of Steve Levenson from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "On V-22, what do you see is the maximum build rate and when do you expect to hit it?", "Scott Donnelly", "The current multi-year program ramps up to a total number of units that\u2019s about, when we go to 34 in \u201911, ultimately ramps can ramp up to the size of about 40 units. That\u2019s out on say 2013.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right and are you seeing international interest, is there some point when you think that can kick in?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I fully expect that we will see international interest. Right now given the capacity, being pretty tied up at least through 2013, and that is not something that\u2019s imminent, but clearly we are expecting that there will be international opportunities. I think that the Marine Corps and the Air Force obviously from an interoperability perspective wasn\u2019t [realized], we would like to see this as a platform that goes international at some time. So absolutely we do see international opportunities for the aircraft, but I would only be cautious, there\u2019s not something imminent in that regard.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "In your expected deliveries for Cessna, do you have CJ4s built in and when do you expect them to start going in?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, the CJ4s, we expect first commercial deliveries in the second quarter and that will ramp up significantly from the second quarter through the third and ultimately fourth quarter.", "Frank Connor", "There\u2019s about 15 of those in the year.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "Could you give any more thoughts about outsourcing, given the plans for the Columbus plants?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would make a particular comment with respect to outsourcing, there\u2019s certainly a lot of work going on with respect to our cost structure and where and how do we manufacture in the most efficient way. The things that we have announced are moving things out of some of our higher cost facilities into our own facilities down in Mexico. So that\u2019s a significant move. And technically it\u2019s not outsourcing, because it\u2019s a Cessna run facility in Mexico but we look at all avenues. If they can result in a better quality and lower cost, it\u2019s on the table.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "And is that the same thought at Bell too?", "Scott Donnelly", "Absolutely.", "Doug Wilburne", "All right ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you on April 9 and we will talk to you then. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

(NYSE:TXT) Q1 2010 Earnings Call April 22, 2010  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Doug Wilburne - VP, IR", "Scott Donnelly - President and CEO", "Frank Connor - CFO", "Analysts", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Welcome to the Textron first quarter earnings call. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to first quarter results, which appear on slide three of the presentation, revenues in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 12.5% from a year ago, which yielded a loss from continuing operations of $0.01 per share.", "During the quarter, we incurred special charges which include the following two items; $12 million in pre-tax restructuring costs or $0.02 per share on an after-tax basis, and a discrete tax charge of $11 million related to the recently enacted federal healthcare law or $0.04 per share.", "Adjusted earnings from continuing operations excluding special charges then were $0.05 per share compared to $0.26 a year ago. On the pre-tax role front, manufacturing operations used $153 million of cash, reflecting normal seasonality compared to a use of $286 million in the first quarter of 2009.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. While overall revenues were down, reflecting lower aircraft deliveries and the wind-down of our non-captive finance business, we had strong performance across the rest of the company.", "Industrial revenues were up 33%, reflecting strong growth in the global automotive markets and early signs of growth in our non-U.S. markets for EZ-GO and Jacobsen agreement. Aftermarket revenue with Bell and Cessna were both up solid single digits, reflecting increased aircraft utilization. And our Systems business revenues were up over 9.5%. Bell and Systems also delivered solid margins in the quarter. As we look at the trends, we believe the first quarter margin revenue dropped for Textron and we expect our earnings will clearly grow over the course of the year.", "So let's discuss highlights of each of our segments beginning with Finance where we continue to make excellent progress with our liquidation strategy. We reduced managed receivables by $769 million in the quarter, bringing our total reductions since the beginning of 2009 to $4.5 billion. About $380 million of first quarter reduction occurred in our distribution finance business, which contributed to an overall favorable cash conversion rate of 95%. We also made progress in our timeshare portfolio in the quarter, reducing it by $100 million.", "In total, the credit performance, 60-day delinquencies were $515 million, down from $569 million in the fourth quarter; and non-accruals stabilized at $1.03 billion, down modestly from $1.04 billion last quarter. Charge-offs were $31 million, up from $22 million in the fourth quarter, as previously reserved losses were realized. Looking forward, we're increasing our 2010 liquidation target by $200 million to $1.8 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of $5.6 billion.", "At Cessna, we delivered 21 Mustangs and 10 light mid-sized jets in the quarter, consistent with our expectation. Orders in the first quarter were also consistent with our expectations. However, cancellations came in slightly above plan, although a majority were for deliveries in 2011 and beyond. Looking forward, we see additional cancellations in the second quarter, but we're expecting orders to pick up as market and economic indicators continue to trend in the right direction.", "For example, used Citation aircraft available for sale continued to decrease, ending the quarter with 15.1%, down from a peak of 17.3% and 15.4% at the end of 2009. Used pricing remained stable. Average daily utilization of Cessna aircraft also remained stable at 0.66 hours for the quarter, while FA reported takeoff and landing cycles were up. As I mentioned, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up about 6%.", "U.S. corporate profit, a key leading indicator, has been up over the past several quarter, and earning results so far in the quarter have been positive as well. And finally, we are seeing increased sales, particularly in our low-to-mid sized jet models. In the meantime, we continue to work on reducing costs, including consolidation of facilities and moving certain activities to lower-cost locations.", "On the new product development front, the CJ4 was certified during the quarter, and we've already delivered our first unit earlier this month. Looking over the second quarter, we're expecting to deliver between 40 and 45 jets for the balance mixed of Mustangs and light-to-mid sized jets.", "In the Industrial business, we're getting conversion on volume growth, achieving a margin of 7.8%. This reflects the positive impact that our cost reduction programs are having on these businesses. We're also pursuing new business opportunities to launch new products, winning new accounts and expanding geographically.", "At Textron Systems, growth was driven by a diverse array of products we're providing to our troops in today's complex. AAI delivered seven new Shadow systems in the quarter, up from three a year ago. We're also selected to be a key subcontractor for development and initial production of a sophisticated avionic warfare testing system which features AAI's leading-edge RF stimulus and measurement subsystems.", "ASV program also continues to move forward, as we expect to sign new contracts soon, which would increase backlog and extend production through the first quarter of 2012.", "Another product manufactured by our New Orleans based TM&LS operation is the 47-foot Motor Lifeboat. During the quarter we delivered the first of six for the Mexican Navy and are pursuing additional international opportunities for that product as well.", "At Bell, we also had a good quarter, demonstrating continued operational execution. We delivered four V-22s and three AH-1s compared to five and four respectively a year ago, but consistent with our delivery plan for the year. This is simply a matter of timing, and we're on track to deliver 28 V-22s and 20 H-1s this year, up from 20 V-22s and 9 H-1s last year. We also delivered 15 commercial units in the quarter.", "We have significant sales enquiry activity underway. We remain on track for a commercial helicopter delivery plan of about 150 units. Our first 429 entered into commercial service in the air ambulance configuration this month and has already demonstrated its performance capabilities. With 429 production on schedule, we expect to deliver approximately 25 of these aircrafts in 2010.", "So as we look forward for the balance of the year, I'd say we are confident that we can reach our new target of $1.8 billion of liquidations in our non-captive finance business. We feel the cash generation that's been generated to date has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure. Frank would take you through the details of that shortly. It also gives us the flexibility I believe to make sure that we make the proper economic decisions as we exit the balance of that portfolio.", "We talked last year about our restructuring programs and focused on cost reduction and what that would need in terms of delivering additional margin as volume returned. And I think we have demonstrated that in the first quarter in our industrial segment.", "Our systems business continues to have a steady outlook for growth and is executing very well. Bell Military is successfully executing the middle of a multi-year ramp on the military side of the program. And I think we put the right people and the right products in place to capitalize on growth in the commercial sector going forward.", "Clearly the last 18 months have been difficult in the business-jet market, and has presented numerous challenges for our Cessna business. As I indicated earlier, we believe that this cycle is going to follow its normal course. We see the right early indicators, including most recently corporate profits getting stronger, and I would say the increased levels of enquiry and sales activity in the latter part of the first quarter bodes well for this industry to start to turn.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details on the financials.", "Frank Connor", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let's start with the major factors that drove the $0.21 year-over-year reduction in adjusted EPS, which are outlined on slide 7. The largest driver was lower manufacturing volume, which reduced EPS by $0.29. Last year's CESCOM sale at Cessna cost $0.12 per share.", "The number of discrete tax items which occurred last year resulted in a $0.09 reduction in earnings. An inflation rate of 2.3% cost $0.11 per share, which outpaced pricing of 1%, which provided a $0.05 lift. A higher share count in interest expense cost $0.03 per share. And our pension headwind cost $0.02. On the positive side, overall cost performance and lower S&A benefited the quarter by $0.38 per share, and TSC's lower operating loss contributed $0.02 on a year-over-year basis.", "Now, let's start with the results for each of our segments, starting with Cessna. For Cessna in the quarter, revenues decreased $336 million, reflecting lower aircraft volumes. Segment profit decreased $114 million due to the lower sales volume, the gain related to last years CESCOM sale, and higher inflation. These items were partially offset by improved cost performance, which included lower selling and administrative expenses, largely due to workforce reductions, lower inventory reserves, and lower used aircraft losses. Cessna backlog at the end of the quarter at $4.1 billion, a decline of $820 million from the end of last year.", "Looking at Bell, revenues decreased $124 million due to lower sales volume. Segment profit, however, increased $5 million, as positive program performance, non-recurring product launch cost in 2009, and lower warranty selling and administrative cost more than offset the negative impact of reduced volumes. Bell backlog at the end of the first quarter was $6.9 billion, down slightly from the end of last year.", "For Textron Systems, segment revenues and profits increased $40 million and $3 million respectively, primarily due to higher defense volumes. Backlog at Systems, ended the fourth quarter at $1.4 billion, down $220 million from the fourth quarter of last year.", "For the Industrial segment, revenue increased $150 million, which was driven by a $140 million increase in our automotive businesses. Industrial profit increased $58 million due to higher volume and improved cost performance, partially offset by higher inflation net of pricing. Cost performance improved due to workforce reductions and other cost initiatives.", "For the Finance segment, revenues decreased $46 million compared to the first quarter of 2009 largely due to the revenue impact of lower average finance receivables, a mark-to-market adjustment on our held-for-sale portfolio, and suspended earnings on non-accrual receivables. Finance segment losses improved $8 million, primarily reflecting lower loan loss provisions, reduced selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of the lower average finance receivables, the mark-to-market adjustment, and suspended earnings on non-accrual receivables.", "Turning our attention to the 2010 outlook and looking at slide 8, we continue to expect EPS from continuing operations before special charges will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.50 per share, with free cash flow from continuing operations for the manufacturing group of between $500 million and $550 million.", "As Scott mentioned, I'd like to conclude by reviewing progress we've made with our balance sheet. Looking at slide 9, you can see that we ended the quarter with net debt of $6.8 billion, down from $7.4 billion at the end of last year, and $11.9 billion at the end of 2008. And given our improved liquidity position, yesterday we paid down $250 million of Textron's bank line. Based on our current projections, we would expect to make additional payments on the Textron bank line over the balance of the year.", "Now that concludes our prepared remarks for today. And Rich, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will begin with the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "I guess first, at Cessna, were there any forfeiture gains in the quarter to buoy those numbers, and what would be expect in the next quarter given the backlog fall off?", "Scott Donnelly", "The forfeitures during the quarter were about $15 million, and that was about the same level as we saw for the prior year quarter.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "And then the second quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Second quarter, we're not kind of projecting things on a quarter-by-quarter basis. As we said, we expect kind of more cancellation activity, or cancellation activity to continue, but at a lower rate in the second quarter.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen &Company", "And then the last one, I'll let someone else go. The industrial numbers really looked spectacular. Given that normally the second quarter is better and the economy is improving, should we expect that margin of 7.8% to be sustainable, or could be better for the total year?", "Frank Connor", "Okay, I think what's really driving the margin is driven by the automotive industry right now. So, particularly as we look at CapEx, as a result of other restructuring programs, the volume has come back. That's delivered obviously some strong margin. So I guess the only thing I would caveat is, certainly if we can get similar volumes in the automotive sector, we would expect to be able to deliver similar kinds of margin rates.", "There's a lot of question in the automotive sector right now, particularly in Europe and the U.S. is, does it hold the rebound that we saw the on the (report) for first quarter. But clearly, if we deliver that in second quarter, you expect to see those kind of margins.", "Operator", "We will now go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Could you guys provide us with the actual unit ordering cancellation numbers in the first quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "We're not doing the exact numbers. I think that's kind of commercially sensitive. But I've already seen a couple of notes you guys have out there. And obviously on the cancellation front, no one roughly (average) price was, I think, guys are in the right ballpark.", "With those new orders rates in the first quarter were pretty low, but met our expectations. And I think as we look forward, while it's hard to figure out and know the exact quarter, we certainly would say based on sales activity we see it picking up going forward.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "So are you still feeling okay about your 225 unit number for the full year, because if cancellations were worse than you thought in the first quarter, if you run the numbers, it sort of implies you have to get close to 100 or so in net orders in the back half. Is that fair or how you're thinking about that number?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. I think if you look at the 225, Noah, right now, at least the level of activity we're seeing particularly in the light-to-mid size range, we feel pretty good about where the number is. And just looking at prospects out there, the number of people that are doing demo rides and people that we believe are customers that really do want to move on aircraft that we're feeling pretty good about that.", "I would say we probably see still a little more softness in the (inaudible) side on the Mustang side. But as you know, that doesn't tend to drive a whole lot of revenue or margin in the business at this point. So I guess that's kind of the color I'd put around the 225 at this point.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "And maybe one longer-term question at Cessna. What still needs to happen with the fractionals? Are they entirely out of your backlog at this point? And how do you think about them as a potential overhang on the order recovery going forward? Is there a fleet rationalization started to take place there?", "Scott Donnelly", "I mean I would say that what we're seeing in the industry, certainly what we're seeing in Citation, there is a little bit of an uptick in terms of folks looking at getting back into the fractional world. But I think we have to recognize there's a lot of capacity out there. So from our perspective, over the next couple of years, I discount any fractional sales down to virtually zero.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Scott, could you give us a little color on actual production in the quarter and what it looks like in Q2?", "Scott Donnelly", "With respect to Cessna, Jeff?", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "At Cessna.", "Scott Donnelly", "Obviously with a long cycle product like this, our production, we set up really in the latter part of last year to run at a pretty steady rate both in the last year and all the way through 2010. So that production rate which we started again late last year is holding steady.", "As I kind of indicated, we don't see anything in terms of the level of customer interest, the key leading indicators that would cause us at this time to make any modifications there. So I feel pretty good about that. Again, we'll just kind of watch this thing as the market plays out here through the balance of the year. But I don't see a reason right now, based on demand, to be making any significant changes to our production rates.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And corporate price, I think, Frank said was up 1%. Did Cessna fully pull its weight as it relates to that or was the pricing in dollars somewhere else?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, obviously on the Cessna side of things, pricing is still a challenge. I don't think we're expecting to see price increases. Every customer out there, as you can imagine in downside of a cycle, is expecting good deals. I think we've been pretty responsible on the price side and it's holding there okay, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's a positive contributor as we think about the year in terms of price out of Cessna.", "Frank Connor", "Net in the quarter we had positive price across.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, the product line at Cessna, right.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And I know you're trying to avoid kind of the quarterly guidance, but you typically have given a little bit of a margin framework or some kind of framework, a little bit of a look into the coming quarter. Can you give us any help on how to think about Cessna margins in the second quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I guess what I would say, Jeff, is if you think about, we're kind of guiding about 40-45 aircraft. I think if we see 40-45 jets, we feel we've got a good shot here in getting this thing back into a positive number.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "On the industrial side, do you think the good revenue result is in part due to restocking, or do you think this is going to be a stable level on Litchfield?", "Scott Donnelly", "First of all, most of the stuff we have on the auto side, it flows through, right? So there's not really inventory in a system that goes right to the manufacturers in Europe. At times, you go over to the customer in the U.S., obviously there's more dealer inventory. But everything we're seeing in terms of the market dynamic is this stuff is all selling through.", "In the other markets, particularly if you look at EZ-GO and Jacobsen, again, I think we have good signs of this stuff is moving through the retail channel. So it's not a restocking. In fact, in particular the European markets, which historically will do some restocking through the winter season, didn't really do that. So they held off on taking inventory. And as a result, we're really seeing deliveries that flow directly out through to the field.", "So I don't think we've seen any signs that there is a whole lot of retail restocking going on. It really is going retail.", "Steve Levenson - Stifel Nicolaus", "A quick question on UAVs. Do you see Shadow and the line extension, the product line extension, you're doing there taking share; or do you see some of the other people coming in that's gathering orders?", "Scott Donnelly", "The share discussion frankly is very difficult in UAV space because you have so many niches where this thing plays. And Shadow already has a very, very strong position in that gauge of tactical UAV. And I see us sustaining that. I think the extensions to the product and program, it's evolution over time and growth of mission capability is keeping pace with what the military's expectations are.", "So, I don't look at numbers. I can't tell you exact share numbers, but certainly I think when you look at what we're doing with Shadow and its growth and mission requirements growth, I think it's holding its own.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of Ron Epstein with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Digging a little more on Cessna, Scott, if we pick out a longer term, why would you do differently into the next biz-jet upturn, so that you don't see the Cessna backlog kind of evaporate as severely as it did this time?", "Scott Donnelly ", "Ron, it's a good question. It's a pretty tough one. I mean I don't think we have ever seen this phenomenon, and obviously I was in the business. But as you look back on previous cycles, you never saw such a dramatic roll-off of backlog. And near as I can tell, it's really just driven by the fact that you came into this thing with such an incredibly unprecedentedly strong market in terms of demand for business jets. And then of course, the depth of the economic collapse on the other side was just as severe. So I think we've seen the results of this decline, the backlog are just an intersection of an unprecedented strong period, followed by an unprecedented weak period.", "Obviously, most of us hope not to ever see that again. I mean, I think we'll have more modest growth on the upside, and you'd like this thing because we're never going to see the kind of economic collapse that we saw. And of course, you throw the politics on top of it, which also exaggerated I think the downside of it. So, you had a situation where, even people who still have the economic wherewithal to stay in the backlog, awful lot of people bailed out because they didn't even have a perception of being associated with business jets.", "So, it's just been an awfully wild swing in both directions. Obviously, one of the things we're going to do, and hopefully we see this across the whole industry is, look for tougher deposit terms and higher levels of deposits with many of the customers. I don't want to mislead you, right? That's a commercial (term we) condition, and it's a competitive marketplace out there, but clearly from our perspective we would like to see higher levels of deposits to help make people be more attached to the aircraft. But even so, the severity of the cycles that we just went through, I'm not sure that would have even had a huge impact.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Maybe just a follow-on or two, if that's okay. When you look at the production at Cessna right now, are you guys building white tails, and are other airplanes coming off the line that don't have owners right now?", "Scott Donnelly", "I guess I want to be careful about the use of the word white tail. I would explain, Cessna production, obviously is a relatively long cycle production and you kind of set your rate and you move. And we all knew the first quarter deliveries were going to be very low, and you start to see that ramp over the course of the year. So, certainly our production rate and our delivery rate are not perfectly aligned. But I would not say that we are in a position where we feel like we're building a lot of aircraft that aren't going to have buyers. So, it's more of a work in progress, and yes, for sure you have some that are getting to that finished goods inventory level.", "But that's really more of an artifact of aligning both what your delivery demand is and your production demand. You can't get those on a long cycle business to be perfectly aligned, especially when you're going to have a turn hopefully towards the upside here as deliveries increase over the course of the year.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "And then maybe just a follow-on to (Jeff's) question, as we think about next quarter, do you expect demand to be any better next quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "I do. I mean, I would say that what we saw in the latter part of the first quarter was an increase in the number of individuals that are coming back that are talking to sales folks, are doing demo rides, and with whom there are now active discussions around trying to get purchase contracts. So, I do expect to see the level of order activity pick up as we move through the year. And I certainly expect to see it picking up in the second quarter versus first quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Can you guys just talk about the dynamics of the cancellations? So, were they focused beyond 2011? Can you just talk about the timing of who is still canceling?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would say that most of it was beyond; it was out 2011, 2012 and beyond. There were some 2010 cancellations, which we expect and would expect to continue through the course of the year. I think we've had a number of our ASR folks that have come back and said they don't have a retail customer, that they have a line of sight to him and want to go ahead and cancel the order. So, we've seen some of that. We've seen a couple of small charter operators with Mustangs that in some cases already have some aircraft and are operating and successfully operating, but don't see enough demand in the economy. Yet, to them, to grow their fleet size, we tried a couple others where they're already in business, but they fly also small turboprops and they want to go to a jet, but don't feel like right now is the right time for them to make that transition.", "So it's been some domestic, some international. It really is across the Board Steve in terms of both customer situation and aircraft configuration.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "So I think you said you were 70% sold out for this year, so that number has ticked down. As we stand here at the end of the year, the first quarter and then what it would look like for next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it is modestly down, which we expected, because we knew that the deliveries would be relatively late, orders would be late, numbers cancellation in the quarter. I don't think we're to point yet where we would start talking about what we see the rate going into next year at this point. We got three quarters left in the year, and it's very, very hard at this point, Steve. I think there's no question the dynamics out in the marketplace indicate this thing is going to turn. I wish I was good enough to call which quarter that's going to be. But that will have a big impact on what that rate is as we get into 2011.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Right, but I guess you have a high level of confidence, which is good, that you're not going to cut production this year, but you're not going to be negative in the second quarter imply quite a pickup in the back half of the year. So I'm just curious if you don't see that pickup and the plan to build whitetails at the end of the year and bank on the inevitable pickup to accelerate in 2011?", "Frank Connor", "We would be very cautious about building a lot of whitetails going into 2011. So if we see this thing, it'd be more muted than what we expected or more delayed than what we expected. We would make appropriate adjustments. Given what we're seeing in the marketplace in terms of both indications and inquiries, we're not at a point right now where I think we need to make that adjustment.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "When you say cancellations for the second quarter, is that modest amount of cancellations? It sounds like that's kind of a tone that you're suggesting.", "Frank Connor", "Yes, I think this thing is obviously in our cancellation we expect to be kind of winding down over the course of the year. And we also expect the trend to be looking out at the '11, 12' kind of timeframe.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Got you. And then one last question just on the ASV. You talked about a contract coming up. Are there a couple of contracts there, or is that a specific one that we should be watching? Maybe just give a little more color on that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, there's a couple, but there's one that's pretty material, and that's continued U.S. government ASV program. As I think you probably get indications from a lot of defense contractors, the process of going through audit in pre-contract negotiation has become extraordinarily painful and pretty long and drawn out. So we've not been able to put this thing in the backlog, because we haven't signed the contract.", "We're through the audit phase now. We think we will sign the contract very shortly. And of course, we've been under production and building under a non-definitized contract. So these things have drawn out to the point where the governments had to put alternative vehicles in place to allow production to continue until you get your final definitized contract in place.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. A question on Bell. The volumes this quarter looked a little weak. Can you talk about what you're seeing happening there? Do you still have confidence in the guidance of $3 billion for the year?", "Frank Connor", "I'm sorry, Heidi, you're breaking up a little bit, but I think the question was around Bell and the volume this year versus what that means to our full year forecast?", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Absolutely. I wanted to get some color on what you're seeing in the commercial trends, why the quarter was so weak, and why you're still confident in $3 billion for the year.", "Frank Connor", "Sure. Okay. So the military side (inaudible) report, that was just timing, and we're very confident with respect to our guidance around that and the delivery around V-22s and H-1s. So I feel like there is no issue there.", "The commercial side was pretty light in the quarter. But I think as the 429 is coming on, we didn't have any deliveries for 429 in the quarter. Those will all be for the balance of the year. We have a number of customers, particularly 412 customers, a couple that were originally supposed to be in the quarter that had some contracting issues and are going to happen. In fact, some of it has already happened here in the quarter. They just moved from the first quarter to the second quarter.", "So in general, I think that it was an unusually light quarter for us on the commercial side without a doubt. But I think we still feel pretty good about the getting the 150 commercial helicops for the balance of the year.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "And a question for you, Frank. On the cash flow projections you've given for the year, how much of that is based on Cessna? And if we were to see the second half Cessna deliveries, measurably it'd be about the same as the first half, how would that change your cash flow projections?", "Frank Connor", "Well, it would impact the cash flow projections, Heidi. As Scott said, were we not to see the uptick in order activity and market activity that we expect, we would therefore look to kind of adjust production activity if required. And obviously, that would mitigate some of the working capital impact. But certainly kind of a slowdown in Cessna would have some impact on the cash flow numbers.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "And maybe the last question. As you talk to the customers in Cessna and you think about the second half, because it looks like it's going to have to be heavily back-end loaded towards a better mix in the second half, can you walk us through the different plane types where you're seeing better demand versus some areas which are still (pumpkin) and maybe touch on whether you're revising any thoughts about Columbus?", "Frank Connor", "We're not revising any thoughts about Columbus at this point. I would say, Heidi, we really do see a lot of small business and corporate activity coming back which is I think is explaining strength of number of enquiries around Soveriegns and XLSs which is obviously very good for us in terms of mix. The CJ line is also getting a fair bit of enquiry, and good activity going on there. The only one that's still lighter as I said earlier is really on the DLG side on the Mustang side. And obviously we've now delivered over 300 of these things and feel good that we're still going to have some pretty strong volume going forward. But the level of activity where we'd really see the strength in the enquiry side right now is in the light to mid-size, which is good obviously from our mix in terms of both revenue and margin perspective.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Brian Jacoby with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs", "Question I had was around the comment earlier on the bank debt reduction. Just to confirm, did you say that was paid down at the finance operation, or could you clarify that? And then just the magnitude of, obviously, you don't need to pay this down, it's not due till 2012, but obviously it sounds like you're comfortable with cash flow and so forth. But can you give us an idea of what type of a timeframe are you trying to get this reduced to closer to more manageable levels?", "Frank Connor", "We paid down $250 million of the Textron Corp line, not the finance line. As you'll recall, we are actually providing inter-company financing from Corp to Finance. And so, the intention would be, given our liquidity position, which we ended the quarter at about $1.5 billion worth of cash that we would apply excess cash throughout the year as we continue to generate free cash flow to continue to pay down the Textron Corp bank line.", "And as we've said, the bank deals are not due until April of 2012. We are generating very significant free cash flow reflective of that early, you know beginning to pay that down, and we'll address the bank lines in plenty of time before the maturity, and are continuing to watch the bank market, any improvement in the overall tone of the market, and we'll make those decisions as we roll forward here.", "Scott Donnelly", "Rich, I understand that we've got a follow up call, so we'll take that before we conclude today.", "Operator", "We'll go back to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "In the receivable run off at TSC, what percentage was distribution versus, I guess, lower quality assets relative to the past couple of quarters? And maybe if you could update us on the full year loss number unit targeted before, I guess, was $250 million; you'd have to have the loss accelerating to get there. How are you thinking about that number for the rest of the year?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, so the total number of the 769, 380 of that was out of distribution finance?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, that's on page five of the presentation materials. So we'll give you a break down and I guess not only clarify that. It's not so much the good asset, bad asset. I mean it's certainly the longer cycle stuff. So clearly, over the course of the year we will have more and more of this. We'll move in to the resort, golf as opposed to being so much in the distribution of finance side.", "But the progress we're making there, as we get towards the end of the year, we're just about running out of distribution plans. And there is no change right now to our guidance in terms of our loss expectations. So in other words we think we can get that additional couple of hundred million dollars of liquidation that we are now forecasting and still live within the loss numbers of that we gave you earlier.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "And are you willing to comment maybe on how close we are at this point to being able to sell very, very large chunks or maybe the entire remainder of TFC excluding aviation, at some kind of reasonable price?", "Scott Donnelly", "There's nothing going on right now that would lead us to believe that you would sell very large chunks of this. I mean we still don\u2019t see the level of interest or liquidity out in the markets, particularly in golf resort. The resort side, frankly, as we go forward more and more to that is going to amortization and that's where the bulk of that liquidation is coming from.", "So people are terming out in their notes, and that's good for us. On the golf side, I'd say that's an industry that's still sort of in a state of flux, but I would not expect to see anybody coming in and looking for large portions of an asset class like that right now.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it's a course here a course there and that's how we're going to work our way through it.", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay. That concludes our call for today. We thank everybody for joining us, and we'll be seeing you soon. Thanks.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m today through July 20th at midnight.

(NYSE:TXT) Q2 2010 Earnings Call July 21, 2010  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Doug Wilburne - VP of IR", "Scott Donnelly - President and CEO", "Frank Connor - CFO", "Analysts", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "George Shapiro - Access 342", "Operator", "Welcome to Textron's second quarter earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks, Robert, and good morning everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention that we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's President and CEO; and Frank Connor, Textron's Chief Financial Officer. We are originating our call from London today, as Scott and Frank are here meeting with customers and industry participants in conjunction with the Farnborough Air Show.", "Our customary earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to the second quarter results, which appear on slide three of the presentation, revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, up 3.7% from a year ago, which yielded GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27. This compares to a $0.23 per share loss in last year's second quarter.", "We incurred $0.02 per share on restructuring charges in the quarter. So our second quarter EPS from continuing operations before special charges was $0.29 per share compared to $0.08 a share a year ago. The manufacturing operations generated $170 million in free cash flow during the quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. We're pleased with the solid resumption of top-line growth in the quarter, reflecting expansion of our defense business and recovery in our early cycle markets.", "While the pace of the recovery remains uncertain with the European sovereign debt concerns having negatively impacted business and consumer confidence during the quarter, we do believe the ability of our businesses to generate profits and cash in the cycle is apparent in our second quarter results.", "So let's take a look at how that played out in our businesses, starting with Industrial where revenues were up about 30%. We continue to achieve good conversion on this revenue growth, as we posted a segment margin of 7.7%, which reflects the positive impact our cost reduction programs are having.", "At the same time, we're also focused on new product development to drive growth. For example, during the quarter, we introduced EZ-GO's new low-speed road vehicle, the 2Five. 2Five is a zero-emission electric vehicle that meets regulatory standards for use on 35 miles an hour and under public roads.", "We believe the EZ-GO brand will work well in this market and customer demand during the product's introduction launch has been positive. With the public attention on energy conservation, we believe this will be a good growth opportunity for us that leverages our current capabilities.", "Moving to the Finance segment, we had another good quarter of liquidations. If you look at slide four in the presentation, you can see that we reduced managed receivables by $674 million, bringing our total reductions since the beginning of 2009 to $5.2 billion. Distribution finance was the largest share of reduction again with $203 million. Also, $120 million of liquidations were generated from our timeshare business, which is also a positive continued future success of our liquidation plan.", "As we look at the rest of the year, we're increasing our total 2010 liquidation target from $1.8 billion to $2 billion, which will bring us to a two-year reduction of nearly $6 billion.", "Looking at slide five, the cash conversion on finance asset liquidations came in at 87% for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date rate to 91%. We now expect our full year cash conversion rate will trend into the mid to high 80s.", "In terms of credit performance, we saw a reduction in 60-day delinquencies from $515 million to $385 million and a reduction in non-accrual finance receivables from $1.03 billion to $876 million primarily due to the resolution of several accounts for restructuring and repositioning activities. Charge-offs were $57 million, up from $31 million in the first quarter as previously reserved losses were realized.", "Moving to Cessna, results were in line with our expectations as we delivered 43 jets, 23 light to mid-sized and 20 Mustangs. As a result, Cessna returned to profitability and positive cash flow for the quarter. Business jet usage continued to expand. Our average daily utilization reached to 0.68 hours from about 0.66 hours in the first quarter. The FAA rolling three-month averages for takeoff and landings were up in both April and May. Our due date will probably be out shortly.", "Correspondingly, Cessna aftermarket revenues were up nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. On the used front, the number of previously owned Cessna's available-for-sale remained flat with last quarter at 15.1% and used pricing remained relatively stable with the exception of some further weakness in older models high-usage aircraft.", "On the order front, as expected, we had a number of cancellations, which included the cancellation of a large Mustang order from a European fleet operator. On the other hand, gross orders increased from the first quarter. And most of these orders were for light to mid-sized aircraft, so we actually had a positive order contribution backlog on a dollar basis.", "While we're encouraged by demand trends in April and May, June did see a slowdown in market activity following European debt concerns, which we believe weakened business confidence around the world.", "As we discussed on our April call, we've already been experiencing softness in the Mustang orders. As a result, we've reduced our 2010 Mustang order outlook to about 70 units and adjusted our production plan accordingly.", "With respect to the light to mid-sized market, we're still evaluating how the pace of the economic recovery might impact demand for these models. We're hopeful that Congress will pass the bonus depreciation bill. We believe the continued positive earnings reports, the stabilization of the European credit market will contribute to an improved environment for business jet orders.", "We will be watching the market closely over the next several months. We will fine-tune our delivery expectations, production plans for light to mid based on how the market develops. In any event, we continue to believe that business jet demand will recover as long as the global economy continues to expand. I still believe that 2010 will be the trough year for Citation deliveries.", "As we move to Textron systems, revenues were up nearly 12% reflecting strong domestic and international demand for our products. For example, on the international front, we completed delivery of the $57 million Sensor Fuzed Weapon shipment to the United Arab Emirates in June. Margins were also strong again, as we had good performance on our legacy US Armored Security Vehicle and unmanned aircraft system contracts.", "Backlog was up in the quarter, driven by new US ASV orders and Shadow systems from Sweden. We expect the backlog will grow again in the third quarter based on anticipated domestic shadow orders as well as the recently announced deal to supply shadow systems to Italy.", "We also recently completed two small bolt-on acquisitions of systems which add nicely to our product and technical capabilities. The most recent, Crane Wireless Monitoring Solution based in Texas will complement our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products to better meet our world needs of growing reliance on networked sensors as well as a host of future non-military security applications.", "And last month, we added MillenWorks, which is an engineering company out of California that augments our advanced powertrain and suspension capabilities for combat and specialty vehicles.", "Looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned despite likely DoD spending constraints to our products that are aligned with prevailing nature of asymmetrical threats and throughout the international demand as well.", "Wrapping up with Bell, we had a good quarter both in terms of top-line growth and operational execution. On the military side, we delivered eight V-22s and three H-1s. The V-22 continues to perform well on theater, and we've begun discussions with the customer on next multi-year contract, which would cover production beginning in 2014.", "On the H-1, we're on track with a production ramp to deliver 14 units during the second half of the year. We also signed a contract for 27 additional units which begin delivery late next year. And the DoD has recently completed its operational evaluation of the attack version of the H-1, and we expect the full rate production decision this fall. So the outlook for the H-1 program remains very positive at this point.", "Moving to the commercial side of the business, we delivered 21 helicopters, up from 15 in the first quarter. On the marketing front, we had positive net orders in the quarter contributing to an increase in bulk backlog. We are also making good progress through our 429 program. Initial delivery unit was placed in a medevac service. It's performing superbly and receiving accolades from the operator.", "Certification of specific configurations is moving forward, and we are continuing to book 429 orders into our backlog. We expect deliveries to resume this quarter with about 75 planned over through the balance of this year and through 2011.", "So the overall outlook at Bell this year and beyond is very good, both our commercial and military businesses. As Doug mentioned earlier, we're in Farnborough where Bell and Systems both had terrific reception of their products. In particular, the U.S. Marine Corps has a UH-1 Yankee Heuy that's been in combat in Afghanistan. The crews that have been flying that aircraft are giving great feedback to prospective customers.", "Systems has Shadow and Aerosonde systems on display, and we've had a lot of international interest I think which builds well on top of our recently announced wins in Sweden and Italy. Cessna, while this is not typically a business jet show, is also seeing significant interest in terms of air assets for little troop movement as well as ISR missions.", "To summarize, we think second quarter results demonstrate the earnings power of the company, and we will continue to focus on cost productivity and new product development. The benefits of these efforts were evident in Industrial segment margin again this quarter. Our Systems business continues to execute very well, and we have a steady outlook for growth there, especially with international opportunities that are emerging.", "Bell is successfully executing the multiyear ramp in military platforms, and we're seeing increased activity in the commercial sector which should lead to solid growth over the foreseeable future.", "At Cessna, clearly the last two years have been difficult in the business jet market, and we continue to believe this cycle is going to follow its normal course. And at Finance, we're confident we can reach our new liquidation target of $2 billion. And the cash which we've been generating has allowed us to make substantial improvements in our capital structure.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Frank to provide financial details in full.", "Frank Connor", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. To pick up on Scott's comments on capital structure, as you can see on slide seven, in the quarter we reduced our net debt to $6.1 billion from $6.8 billion at the end of the first quarter and $7.4 billion at end of last year. We are now targeting to reduce our net debt to below $5.5 billion by the end of this year.", "We also made a second $250 million repayment on the Textron bank line, bringing the total repayment to $500 million for the quarter.", "You can now turn to slide eight, as we examine the major factors that drove $0.21 per share year-over-year increase in EPS before special items. Inflation came in as a 2% rate, which reduced earnings by $0.12 per share in the quarter, while positive pricing of 1.3% provided a $0.09 benefit. A higher share count, taxes and other miscellaneous items cost $0.07 per share. The combined impact of volume, mix and M&A cost $0.04 per share. Increased pension expense was $0.04. TFC's reduced losses benefited the quarter by $0.07. And our restructuring and execution focus netted a cost performance benefit of $0.32 per share.", "Now let's look at the results for each of the segments, starting with Cessna. Cessna revenues decreased $236 million, reflecting delivery of 43 jets compared with 84 jets in the corresponding period last year. These decreases were partially offset by higher aftermarket and used aircraft volumes.", "Segment profit decreased $45 million due to the lower volume and a reduction in deposit forfeiture income, partially offset by lower used aircraft write-downs, inventory reserves and selling and administrative expenses. Cessna backlog at the end of the second quarter was $3.7 billion, down $400 million from the end of the first quarter.", "Bell revenues increased $153 million in the second quarter, reflecting higher V-22 and H-1 deliveries and higher spares and support volume, partially offset by lower commercial aircraft volume. Segment profit increased $36 million due to improved performance, higher military volume and commercial aircraft pricing in excess of inflation.", "The improved performance reflects a $21 million operating profit contribution for the recognition of reimbursements for prior-period H-1 and V-22 program costs, plus the non-recurrence of 2009 termination cost related to certain cancelled commercial models. Bell backlog increased $200 million from the end of first quarter to $7.1 billion.", "Moving to Textron Systems, revenues increased $57 million primarily due to higher UAS volume. Segment profit increased $15 million due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance. Systems backlog at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $200 million from the end of the first quarter.", "At Industrial, revenues increased $153 million due to higher volumes, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Segment profit increased $39 million due to higher volumes and improved cost performance partially offset by inflation. Looking to the rest of the year for Industrial, we expect growth to slow somewhat, reflecting normal summer and year-end holiday shutdowns in the automotive industry.", "Moving to Finance, revenues decreased $30 million largely due to the non-recurrence of last year's gains on debt extinguishment and lower average finance receivables, partially offset by reduced portfolio losses. Finance segment loss improved $28 million, reflecting lower loan loss provisions, portfolio losses and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by the non-recurrence of gains on debt extinguishment and the impact of lower average finance receivables.", "Now moving to a few corporate items, corporate expenses were less than expected in the quarter, primarily on the compensation expense line resulting from a lower prevailing stock price. Our tax rate in the quarter was also lower, primarily related to a number of discrete items associated with our international operations which benefited the quarter by about $0.03. For the rest of the year, we anticipate that our tax rate will return to about 30%.", "Now let's talk about special charges for the year looking at slide nine. First, we're increasing our restructuring cost estimate from $30 million to $45 million or about $0.10 on an after-tax per chare basis. Most of this increase is for additional restructuring at Cessna.", "And a second change results from the continuing wind-down of our TFC Canadian operations where we anticipate taking a non-cash after-tax charge of about $78 million or about $0.26 per share. Now, this charge eliminates the balance of a cumulative currency translation account and will be triggered when the Canadian operations is considered to be substantially liquidated, which we expect to occur during the second half of the year.", "It's important to note that the equity in TFC and Textron has already been reduced by this amount to previous other comprehensive income adjustments. So there is no further equity impact from this charge.", "So let's now turn our attention to our 2010 outlook, and we're now looking at slide 10. As demonstrated in our second quarter results, we are more than making up for the weaker current performance of Cessna with stronger performance from the rest of our businesses.", "On a net basis, we are increasing our 2010 outlook for EPS from continuing operations before special charges to $0.55 to $0.65 a share. We are maintaining our free cash flow from manufacturing operations outlook to $500 million to $550 million, although the probability is that we will likely trend towards the lower end of that range, given the lower expected delivery outlook at Cessna.", "That concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Could you give us a little more granularity at Cessna, if we take out the used aircraft and the forfeiture gains what the results would have looked like, and some color on the pattern of R&D over the balance of the year at Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "We're sort of almost at a watch here in terms of forfeiture gains and used write-offs. And again, used write-offs were kind of pretty focused on a couple of the older high-time, high-cycle aircraft that we still have in inventory. So we're pretty close to [net watch].", "In terms of your question on R&D, that cycle we will see increasing levels of R&D as we work our way through the balance of the year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "If we take out the Mustang, are the citation delivery estimates intact?", "Scott Donnelly", "At the point we have right now on the light-to-mid size, we're not formally adjusting one way or the other where we are on a thing. As I said in my prepared notes, the market I would say through the first half of the year has trended like we thought in terms of our expectation in orders.", "We did have a little concern here in the latter part of the quarter as things kind of got rather around a little bit with the (inaudible) thing going on and what not. We saw some people sort of turn the back off. I don't think there are customers that are leaving necessarily, but people are taking a bit of a pause, if you will, to understand what's going on with the recovery.", "Obviously, we don't know if that's a 30-day issue or a quarter or two. So that's one where we're just going to watch it. And obviously, if we see any kind of significant changes to our plan, we'll adjust production accordingly and obviously we'll have a lot better insight advice on future calls.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "And the last one, you had lot of changes relative to what people were looking for. Can you us give us just some color on the trends we should expect to your major businesses for the full year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would say that if you kind of walk through each of the segments, Industrial I would expect to stay relatively strong. Historically, you usually see some softening just because of the volume is usually softer in the second half of year than the first half of the year in the automotive industry. Obviously, with Kautex being a big part of that, we would expect to see probably a modest decline through the course of the year, again driven primarily just by auto doing its normal cycle.", "I think that Bell and Systems are going to continue to perform strongly through the balance of the year. I don't think you're going to see 13% margin rates obviously. The REA helped in the quarter for Bell, and we had some pretty strong deliveries here on some international programs like the SFW in the UAE in the second quarter. But I would expect those businesses will still be strong performers through the whole balance of the year and going forward.", "Cessna, despite someone certainly around the order front, it's certainly our expectation that we will see incremental improvements as we go through each quarter in terms of our margin rates. So I think that's a reasonable expectation.", "And Finance, there is no change to our previous guidance. I think we'll end up seeing a loss consistent with what we've guided you through the total year.", "Operator", "And next we will go to the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Can you just give us the actual unit numbers in terms of what the gross orders were and what the cancellations were, by Mustang and by the rest of the business?", "Scott Donnelly", "You know, we haven't been putting those numbers out. Again, I think those are pretty commercially sensitive. For instance, on Mustang, we are giving you the numbers and the production rate, because we set up the production rate. So that's where we are and there is no issue with doing that. I would say, as I said, the bulk of the orders in the quarter were light to mid-sized, which I think is a positive sign.", "Right now we think at least in this market environment that the mustang really probably is 70 to 75 units per year kind of a run rate. So that's what we would expect to see, you know orders and what not. That supports that, and you get in the light to mid-size. And we'll see how that plays out through the balance of the year. Positive so far but a little bit of uncertainty just driven by the fact, which you know little bit of a slowdown in business confidence year to quarter generally through the first half.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk a little bit more about who is buying aircraft today, what type of customer it is?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, mostly, you know as we see in the light to mid, you are talking about a fair number of Sovereign's and XLSs. I mean, these are small businesses. Order activity has been probably stronger in the US than anywhere. And one of the things that concerned us, you know, the half obviously is the European currency weakened against the dollar that sort of slowed down Europe as a region. But I would say its generally been small to mid-size business, probably strongest in the US, still some reasonable strength in Latin America and some in Asia.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "And just one more. On the 429 at Bell, when was first delivery, and Dunn I think you reiterated this, 25 and 10, 15, 11. Is that correct? And at one point you were talking about the 300 letters of intent and I think the story was, the downturn that kind of came right as you would normally start assigning serial numbers there. So you sort of held off and there has been some movement in the backlog. Can you just kind of update us on where you are in that process and how strong that backlog is today?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, absolutely. You are absolutely right. The 300 letter of intent that was out there was unfortunate when this 429 kind of came to the market in a pretty tough spot in terms of the commercial helicopter market. So the conversion rate on that 300 into the current backlog has been very low.", "On the other hand, I would say over the last quarter or so we have been moving 429s into backlog as configurations have been identified. I would say that I feel probably better about the level of customer activity and the number discussions that are going on and the number of orders that we're starting to create in the 429 that I did from the beginning of the year.", "So I think we are really starting to feel some pretty strong momentum. And that's really a function of getting these aircraft out there, a lot of demo rides, getting it into service, people starting to get some feedback on how it's performing with the actual aircraft.", "So I feel probably better about the 429 right now than I have over the past year. So I think we're going to wait through that cycle, but also having aircraft out there and really being able to go out and start marketing and selling hard, it's doing very well.", "E75, through the balance of 2011, I still feel very good about. We are, I would say, moving and not getting there as quick I'd like this year in terms of getting specific interiors defined and the associated certifications that have to happen with those. So it's always been backend loaded; it's still very backend loaded in terms of 429 shipments.", "Most of that frankly though, is on us to get the configurations defined and get the certifications completed. So right now, I'm hopeful. We're sitting close to the 25 this year. But then if we don't, obviously I think we go out in the early part of 2011.", "So I'd say the bottom-line in terms of the 429, it was unfortunate that the thing finally, actually came into production and launched at a pretty difficult time in the cycle. But the demand as we see it right now is strong and increasing, and I feel good about getting up to the production rate, the delivery rate we can talk about.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Just a couple quick ones. I guess first, just thinking about adjusting the Cessna production potentially, it sounds like you're on the cusp of trying to make a decision there. I just want to get a sense of, if that's where the cash caution is. We've got earnings going up and maybe cash trending down. I would think the supply chain is probably geared up to that original production forecast.", "But just give us a little sense of how you manage that and what the working capital ramifications might be if you do turn down the production forecast this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Jeff. Yes, I mean you're absolutely right. The pressure point that would push us to being low range in terms of our cash expectations would attract working capital at Cessna. So as you know, these are pretty long cycle manufacturing operations. An awful lot of material is already in-house or crafted or underway, and we understand that.", "As we see how these orders are playing out, we can obviously make adjustments in terms of what aircraft we build out and what aircraft we don't build out. But regardless of that, we'll still have some trapped inventory in there that will put pressure on the cash from a working capital standpoint.", "And as you know, that's offset by the fact that in the other businesses we're generating high [NOP] than was in the plan and good working capital measure in all through the rest of the businesses. But that would be the pressure point for us is, is that we do need to turn down the rate of production. We certainly will do that, but given the long cycle nature of these things, which is why you have (dug) them in the pipeline anyway, it would create some working capital pressure at Cessna.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners", "Now on the flip side of that Scott, if you get to multi-year on the Zulu or further negotiation on the next tranche of V-22, does that drive some cash progress payment through deposits or anything that's favorable in the back-half of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Not really, Jeff. We have not on those programs had to go out with a lot of long lead material or something we would take at a risk and then catch up. So having a lot H-1 done is great. And then obviously, the discussion we are talking about on V-22 multi-year, now that's up in 2014. So haven't even begun to expend any kind of cash on that program.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Is there anything else in the pipeline on favorable adjustments, like maybe even on the ARH, I think there was some dispute on whether or not some of that would come back to you. Is there on any of these programs, V-22, H-1, ARH, anything else in the pipeline that comes back as a favorable adjustment to you that you can see?", "Scott Donnelly", "As you know, we have some reserves up on things like ARH. But I don't think those are in a situation where they're going to be settled anytime and in the real near future.", "Frank Connor", "And I think it's fair to characterize that our outlook includes any of those miscellaneous types of (earnings) as a matter of course, Jeff.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And then finally, can you just give us a thought on how the CJ4 ramps from here? I see you got the first three out of the door in the quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "That will continue on that trajectory, Jeff. So there really has been no change at all on the CJ4. We'll probably end up 15 this year which is what we were anticipating.", "Operator", "We have a question now from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Just on Bell, I'm curious the $21 million, you said it was a combination of the two items. Could you tell us what the reimbursement number was this quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "None of that cash was in this quarter. It was second half.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. The settlement in terms of the revenue and the [NOP] impact of that REA is in Q2. But the cash won't issue till later this year.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Right. I'm curious about the [NOP] impact.", "Frank Connor", "That happened in the second quarter.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Right. How much was that?", "Frank Connor", "$21 million.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Okay, got you. I thought that was the combination of the two items. Okay, great, $21 million. And then just on the commercial side at Bell, I think your previous target was 150 commercial deliveries. You've delivered I think 40 or something year to date. How do you think about that production target out in the back half of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "If that's still the target we have, Steve, and I feel pretty good about it. Obviously, it varies by model. I think when you look at 412s, I feel very good about it. I think the 429s we are going to be pretty close to where we want it to be. There's still some softness for variability a little bit in the 407s and 206s.", "But as you know, from our perspective and the bulk of the cash is tied up in those larger aircraft. So I think we're in pretty reasonable shape as we head through the balance of the year on the commercial front.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "And then one more question just on the 429. You're talking about 75 now for the next couple of years. We're hearing numbers from the press that you guys have about 20 of those orders right now and that will, kind of, I guess you confidence about delivering this year. Is that around the right number as far as firm orders for that aircraft?", "Scott Donnelly", "We haven't had that number out there, but I actually think it's a bigger number than that. And again, a lot of this, Steve, we don't put them into the backlog until we have definitized the contract and have all the configurations and all that stuff done. So that creates a bit of a lag.", "So I think in terms of what I see in the marketplace right now both what's in the hard backlog, what's under negotiation, what we're specifying working with customers on, I feel very good about that 75 number.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "And then one more question. You guys got a pretty decent amount of price this quarter. The only place you really mentioned was in Bell. Where are you guys were getting at price, because your commercial deliveries are obviously down. And I can't imagine on the OE side, there is a ton of pricing power right now.", "Is that mostly in the aftermarket or is that a function of mix, I don't know. Maybe you could just explain where the $30 million, $35 million price is coming from?", "Frank Connor", "We got some at Bell. Year-over-year, on a quarter basis, we got some at Cessna as well, in different pieces of the Cessna business.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "And is that on the OE side of Cessna?", "Frank Conner", "Yes.", "Steve Tusa - JPMorgan", "Is that a function of the backlog, kind of a trailing? How do we think that price going forward at Cessna?", "Frank Conner", "I think as we've said, at Cessna, we're not expecting that we're going to get price in the current environment or in the near future environment. So I wouldn't expect to continue to see a lot of price benefit, but just year-over-year on the comparative basis, we get.", "Operator", "And we have a question now from the line of George Shapiro from Access 342.", "George Shapiro - Access 342", "I had a question on Cessna. You've mentioned the forfeitures net of write-downs was about 0 this quarter. Now that compared to $15 million of net positive in the first quarter?", "Frank Conner", "Yes, I know the forfeiture number was fifteen in the first quarter. I think we are about flat on used and first quarter price.", "George Shapiro - Access 342", "Okay. And then second, at Bell, if you take out the $21 million you still had about a 10.5% margin, is that sustainable or is the comment about commercial pricing being above inflation this quarter or is that only a quarterly thing?", "Frank Conner", "The Bell margin when back out the REA was about 11%, because there is a revenue impact as well to that REA piece. So on an adjusted basis for the REA, it was 11%. That's at the high end or higher than what we've guided to kind of generally in dollar, we had very good performance during a quarter at Bell.", "George Shapiro - Access 342", "Is that also related to the fact in the subsequent quarters you don't expect to get a benefit from commercial aircraft pricing in excess of inflation?", "Frank Conner", "The real drive on the second half, we'll probably run a little bit less than 10% of Bell in the second half, and the primary driver there is the ramp in the H-1 which is below average margin.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, there's going to be some mix shift.", "George Shapiro - Access 342", "Okay. And then one last one. Industrial, was the mix as the percentage of business from auto this quarter pretty similar to what it was in the first quarter?", "Frank Conner", "Yes, pretty similar.", "Operator", "Thank you, and we have a follow up question from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on this industrial margin performance. You potentially have some favorable mix here and the revenue recovery has been very strong. So we're printing these really nice margins relative to history, but we are doing it on revenue numbers that are substantially lower than where revenue once was in the middle of the last cycle. So I guess the question is, how sustainable are these and is this sort of a new norm and the new starting point? And I guess how much higher do you think they can ultimately go as revenue continues to recover.", "Scott Donnelly", "Although I would say that we did have strong mix in terms of the growth on the Auto side in the segment where I think we've done all our restructuring and we have gotten strong leverage. I think the answer is that is that sustainable? Yes, it's sustainable. But I do think we will see some degradation in volume for second half of the year. So I mean Auto always goes through bit of the cycle, but we're seeing I think we will continue to expect to see higher margin rates on similar volumes that we've had in the past. I do think we'll continue to see this kind of expansion in terms of the margin rates across that entire cycle.", "Doug Wilburne", "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have no further questions in queue. We thank you for joining us today. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today.

Welcome to the Textron Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Wilburne", "Thanks, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to fourth quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $3.1 billion, up 11.2% from a year ago, which yielded GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 compared to a loss of $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we recorded $54 million in restructuring charges or $0.13 per share on an after-tax basis. This was higher than we had previously forecast as we accelerated a number of cost actions at each of our Manufacturing segments and corporate, which brings our restructuring program to an official close.", "Going forward, we do not expect to record restructuring costs as special charges, although we will certainly continue to pursue cost improvements as part of our ongoing business initiatives. ", "Moving back to the fourth quarter. Excluding special charges, EPS from continuing operations was $0.33 per share compared to $0.15 a year ago. One clarification. Fourth quarter EPS reflected an $0.08 per share benefit for settlement of a few international tax items as we discussed on our October call. ", "Moving to cash flow. Manufacturing operations generated $518 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing our full year amount to $692 million. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We capped off the year with a solid fourth quarter in terms of demand, strong operating performance of Bell and Systems and continued success in liquidating our non-captive Finance portfolio. Our cash flow was strong, primarily due to higher volumes in Cessna, Bell and Industrial. In the quarter, we took the opportunity to make a $350 million voluntary contribution to our pension plan and also made the first $300 million payment on TFC's $1.75 billion credit line.", "The most encouraging news in the quarter was a noticeable improvement in the demand environment for business jets, as well as commercial helicopters. At Cessna, we booked the highest number of quarterly gross  jet orders since the third quarter of 2008. The improved commercial order flow also reflected, we believe, bonus depreciation provisions in the U.S. as well as a relatively stable global economic environment.  Because we had inventory available, we were able to meet the increased spot demand of Cessna and delivered 79 business jets in the quarter, bringing our full year total to 179. ", "We were also encouraged with improvements in the used aircraft market as units for sale continues to trend in the right direction with Citation availability now down to 14.5% from 15.4% a year ago and a current cycle peak of 17.3%. ", "Business jet usage also continues to improve, and as a result, Cessna's aftermarket revenues increased 20% during the quarter. On the basis of these trends in the marketplace and the availability of bonus depreciation, we continue to believe that 2011 deliveries will be up slightly from 2010. ", "Moving to Bell. Overall performance continued to be solid, reflecting good management of overhead costs while we were continuing to ramp production volumes. On the commercial side, the strong demand environment led to 71 helicopter deliveries in the quarter, up from 50 in last year's fourth quarter and up from 24 in the third quarter this year. We also had good execution on the 429 program as we delivered 16 units in the quarter, bringing 2010 deliveries to 20. ", "We're encouraged with what we're seeing in the commercial helicopter industry, and we believe that Bell deliveries in 2011 will also be up slightly from the 131 which we delivered in 2010. On the military front, we delivered seven H-1s and seven V-22s. And importantly in the quarter, the Zulu attack version of the H-1 passed its op eval and was approved for full rate production in late November. ", "Staying with the military, Systems also had a solid quarter with revenues up about 5%, delivering 10.4% margins. Looking forward, we continue to believe Systems will generate top line growth despite pressures on the DoD budget, given the nature of our U.S. programs and international opportunities. For example, December, we were awarded a contract worth over $250 million to deliver 512 sensor fuzed weapons to India. We are also working on an initial contract for a foreign military sale of armored security vehicles that will start with production prototypes and deliveries this year.", "Moving to the Finance segment. We ended the year with another good quarter of liquidations, reducing managed receivables by $359 million at a cash conversion rate of 84%. This brings our full year reduction to $2.4 billion for the full year cash conversion of 91%. Our non-captive portfolio has been reduced to $2.3 billion, consisting of about $900 million in the Timeshare category, another $900 million in the Golf portfolio, with the balance in Structured capital and a few other miscellaneous categories. ", "Looking to 2011, we expect liquidations in the range of about $750 million to $1 billion, reflecting the smaller portfolio. Cash conversion ratios will also be lower, again, reflecting the nature of the remaining assets. ", "Moving to Industrial. Revenues were up 11.5%, reflecting growth in all four business units in the quarter, with particularly strong automotive demand. This resulted in a full year revenue growth rate in Industrial of 21%. We also had good conversion on higher revenue at Industrial during the year with full year margins expanding 510 basis points, for a total 6.4% for the year. Looking to 2011, we expect modest top line growth and continued margin expansion in the segment. ", "In summary, I believe 2010 was a good year, especially given the volatility we experienced in the global economic environment. We made great progress on our exit from the non-captive Finance business, generated strong cash flow and reduced our consolidated net debt to $5 billion from $7.4 billion last year. At Industrial, improved margins demonstrate our ability, as volumes return, to leverage the cost actions we've taken. Bell had a strong year performance, reflecting the attention we placed there on execution. And I believe we are positioned in both commercial aerospace businesses at Bell and Cessna for the market recovery that appears to have begun to materialize in these industries. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $184 million, up $54 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Let's discuss the factors that drove the improvement, starting with Cessna. Cessna returned to profitability in the fourth quarter from a loss in the third quarter, generating $23 million in segment profit. However, this was down $5 million from a year ago despite revenues being up by about $100 million. This was primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies related to lower production volumes, lower deposit forfeiture income and higher used aircraft write-downs. ", "At Bell, fourth quarter revenues were up $173 million, and segment profit increased $54 million. The increase in profits was helped by better performance in pricing in excess of inflation, partially offset by higher R&D and S&A expenses.", "At Systems, profits were down $10 million despite a $25 million increase in revenues, primarily due to lower pricing on ASVs, UAS mix and inflation. At Industrial, revenues were up $66 million, which drove a $7 million increase in segment profit. At Finance, our segment loss of $57 million was an $8 million improvement over Q4 of 2009, primarily due to lower loan loss provisions and portfolio losses, partially offset by lower interest margin on the reduced portfolio of finance receivables.", "Looking at the balance sheet, with cash flow from liquidations and other cash flows, we expect to pay down the balance of the TFC credit line in advance of its maturity in April of 2012. Additionally, we plan to have a new Textron backup credit line in place during the first half of this year. As Scott mentioned, we ended 2010 with a net debt balance of $5 billion, which reflects a two-year reduction of $6.9 billion. We're comfortable with the strength of our balance sheet and believe we will continue to improve on our position.", "Moving now to pensions, which can be found on Chart 7. Our pension cost in 2010 was $151 million, and we are projecting a 2011 level of about $185 million. This represents an approximate $0.04 per share headwind. These projections are based on a discount rate of 5.75% and assume the long-term rate of return of 8%, both of which are 50 basis points lower than 2010 assumptions. You can also see on the chart that a large portion of our cost is related to the amortization of actuarial losses. ", "Now turning to Chart 8, with respect to cash contributions. In 2010, we paid $417 million, which included mandatory payments of $67 million and the fourth quarter voluntary payment of $350 million. In 2011, we are planning to contribute about $250 million, with about $100 million of that being mandatory. Given the impact of voluntary contributions, going forward we will be providing cash flow guidance on the basis of manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, and will continue to provide planned and actual pension contributions.", "Looking at Chart 8, we are projecting 2011 manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in the range of $800 million to $850 million. ", "Looking at Slide 9 we are projecting our 2011 R&D budget will be about $500 million and a CapEx budget of about $430 million. Increases of 19% and 59%, respectively. ", "Moving to EPS on Chart 10. We are projecting 2011 EPS in the range of $1.00 to $1.15 per share, an increase of 23% to 42%. ", "To give you a sense of the underlying improvement in our business, take a look at Chart 11, which is a walk from our 2010 GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.30 to the midpoint of our 2011 guidance range. $0.51 of the improvement relates to the elimination of special charges and $0.24 reflects the lower Finance segment loss. We have $0.30 in headwinds from higher R&D and depreciation, $0.21 from the lack of one-time discrete tax items in 2011 and an increase in U.S. income, $0.04 from pension headwinds and $0.07 from a higher share count, primarily related to the dilution from our convertible debt, which means that the underlying Manufacturing business is producing an approximate $0.64 increase in earnings per share. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Doug for some additional outlook details.", "Douglas Wilburne", "Thanks, Frank. Turning now to Chart 12. You can see that our outlook includes an estimate for corporate expenses of about $130 million and interest expense of about $145 million. Our 2011 tax rate increases to 31% from 11.8% last year, reflecting the items Frank just covered. ", "Moving now to Chart 13. This shows our projection for each of the segments in terms of revenue and profitability. On the Manufacturing side in the aggregate we're projecting revenue growth of about 12%. And at the midpoint, we are forecasting about a 15% increase in segment profit despite the headwinds that Frank just discussed. We're projecting a segment loss of about $140 million at Finance, which incidentally translates to about $0.29 on an EPS basis. ", "Flipping now to Chart 14. Our estimated fully diluted GAAP share count for next year is about 322 million shares. We base this estimate on an assumed average share price of about $27.50, which is not a forecast on our part, but just the assumed basis for purposes of calculating EPS guidance. Keep in mind that this GAAP share count is disadvantaged by the exclusion of the economic benefit of the purchased call option associated with the convertible debt that we issued in '09. For valuation purposes, we would suggest that the per share calculation should be based on a share count that includes the impact of the option.", "On that basis, we believe that about 298 million shares is the appropriate 2011 share count for valuation purposes. Just as a reminder, a dilution modeling spreadsheet is available in the IR section of our website. To wrap up then, we have several additional charts in the back of the presentation deck that we won't cover on the call but may be helpful to your analysis. ", "That then concludes our prepared remarks for today. And Leah, we're ready now to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Peter Skibitski with SunTrust.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets", "I guess the big thing that stuck out for me in the quarter is learning how to reconcile a pretty big revenue uptick at Cessna next year with the fact that backlog was down pretty sharply during the quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Peter. I think the way to think about Cessna for next year is that, again as we said, we're forecasting that we'll be up slightly in terms of our deliveries. I'd say we feel pretty good about that number right now. To be honest, we're not in a very different place than we were at the beginning of 2010 in terms of needing to have orders come in through the course of the year. But I think we sort of took a one-year delay here as we saw the market not recover as we expected in 2010. We're going to see that recover, we believe, in 2011. But it's mostly going to be the kind of a flow business. In other words, we did not see in '10, I would not expect to see in '11, a lot of positive backlog build because I believe most of the orders, most of the business will be transacting more in the near term. So it's not like we're going to see, I don't believe yet, in the cycle what you've seen in previous cycles where you have this huge build of backlog for demand out in future years. It is going to be more of a flow business. So even in an environment where you have positive net orders and are hitting the delivery rates we expect, I don't think you're going to see a big outyear order backlog build. So I don't know, at this stage of the cycle, watching backlog is probably not the right indicator in terms of how the year will play out.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets", "And then on the margin guidance for next year at Cessna, are you kind of anticipating pricing pressure? Is that kind of the big driver of the lower margin rate?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, it's not so much on the pricing side of it. It really is just that we're still talking about very low production rates. So we still have a lot of inefficiencies built into the system. Even at the numbers we're talking about, they really are the kind of levels of numbers that we were talking about as being the sort of the 2010 levels. With low production rates, and overhead absorption is challenging in that environment, I don't think you're going to get big positive pricing. But I think we see the pricing outlook right now as being fairly stable.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Capital Markets", "Is 200 a good number for Citations next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would think that would be more than slightly up.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Can you just help us square the slightly up comment on units at Cessna versus the $3 billion in revenue, which would imply kind of a mid-teens revenue growth rate?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that the unit number, Noah, we are going to have a stronger bias towards more light midsized next year than Mustang. So you're going to see the total unit volume number up slightly, and you're going to see a better mix in terms of revenue per aircraft.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So some mix and then presumably some good growth in the non-jet part of Cessna as well?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, we'll continue to see service grow. But I think a big part of it is you are going to see more of a mix towards light mid versus Mustang.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then, Scott, I wondered if you could maybe try to walk us through or describe the mentality of your customer that you're talking to today, because we've seen, as you say, inventory get better, utilization get better, the equity market has had a sustained rally, corporate profits are good. But we haven't really had that demand recovery yet. And presumably part of that is the political overhang or the do-more-with-less mentality, and so nobody wants to spend money. Can you maybe just talk about some of the conversations you're having with regard to how much those overhangs are starting to alleviate themselves, or just how your customer is thinking these days?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Noah. I think most of my feedback would be coming from talking to the sales guys here recently, and their mood is fairly positive. Obviously, they feel like they have some momentum coming out of a strong fourth quarter. Customer conversations continue to be very positive. I would say the political overhang has fallen off significantly. The fact that the used market has been picking up and running off aircraft and seeing some stability in pricing in that environment helps the current -- a lot of our customers because they already have an aircraft. And so the trade-in becomes more feasible or the ability for them to sell the aircraft becomes more feasible. The only caution I have is that these are -- this mood of the customer as being willing and having very detailed and serious discussion about working themselves towards actually placing an order, we saw that happening last spring as well.  And I think, again, the political overhang didn't change, but just concern over the economy. When the euro crisis hit, it kind of set people back a bit, and so they backed off. And frankly, they stayed away for the better part of nine months, coming back towards the end of last year. So I'd say the mood is very positive with the sales folks. The conversations with customers are very good. We really do have a lot of customers who now are at a point where they are a year, two years, three years from when they would normally want to roll aircraft. So they're eager to get back into it. But again, the key factors are their ability to dispose of their current aircraft. And in that case, the used market becoming more viable is helping them. And I think the political overhang is largely gone at this point. So that's kind of my view of the mood of what's out there, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "The Systems revenue number implies double-digit revenue growth there. Can you just give us the kind of couple of bigger items that are driving the very good growth in that segment?", "Frank Connor", "The biggest driver's SFW.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, ASV is fairly stable, UAS is up a little bit, although with a more of a mix of refurbishments than new units this year. And we do expect to see an uptick in the SFW business. We obviously have current orders that we're delivering on, and we'll start to see some of this India order flow through this year as well.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Scott, could you also just elaborate a little bit on kind of managing production in '11? Obviously, the term flow business is not something that people -- is there something you need to do different to work through that? Is it work in progress airplanes that need to be kind of at the ready? And just the ramifications on cash and supply chain as you work through that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Joe. The way I'm looking at it right now is, as I said, it's not a lot different than it was last year, right? You're absolutely right. This is a business that used to building to a backlog. And the reality is, while there is some element to backlog and some number of aircraft that are spoken for, we're also at a large part at this point building to a forecast. So we took our best shot at that last year. It was kind of interesting as we went through the year, the view of the outside world is we were either building them and hoping people would buy them, or we were way underbuilding them. So it's anybody's guess. But we worked to a forecast. As we went through last year, as you guys know, we got a little bit nervous as we went through the mid-part of the year because the strength that we felt in the market, obviously, disappeared. So we got midway through the year, and we thought, geez, we're building too many airplanes. And then we saw November, December come in and turned out we built about the right number of airplanes. So we're in that exact same mode now this year. So we are building to a forecast. And it's the same way you'd run any other business. We sit down with the sales folks, and we try to understand where the market's going. And obviously, you have to do this on a model by model basis, and make an estimate about where we think it's going to come out. I'll say the exact same thing I said last year, which is my tendency at this point is I would err slightly towards having too many aircraft because if you get another run in December, which we had in '09 and now we've had in 2010, I want to make sure we have aircraft available. Now we're not going to go build tons of inventory, but if push comes to shove, we'll err a little bit on the side of having aircraft available. That worked for us this year, and I think we'll try to accomplish the same thing in 2011.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And on Bell, just one question here on the current quarter and then thinking about next year. Frank, you mentioned performance in the margins. Is there some kind of performance award or something in there? 14% margin in Bell is, obviously, exceptional and you're not modeling that going forward. Is there a one-off of some sort there?", "Frank Connor", "No, there's no one-off there, Jeff. That's just reflective of the volume levels in that quarter, kind of spread across the base of Bell. So we're just benefiting from the volume increases. Obviously, the fourth quarter was a big quarter when you look at it kind of across the year.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And then as we get further into the H-1 and V-22 ramp in '11 and '12, it looks like you're dealing with margin kind of mix pressure that you could conceive doesn't seem to be weighing on the business too significantly. What are the offsets there? Is it aftermarket? Is it the restructuring benefits? I just would have thought I would see a little bit more margin pressure as some of those big OE programs ramp up.", "Frank Connor", "Well, I'd say we are benefiting, certainly, from aftermarket. We're benefiting from just very good cost performance and restructuring activities across the business. And those programs are also performing very well. We've done a nice job of delivering kind of on contract, on schedule, and we are really benefiting from that additional volume across our base.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And finally for me, I don't know if you've said it. But where's the funded status of the plan at year end?", "Frank Connor", "We're at about $1.3 billion.", "Scott Donnelly", "About $1.3 billion, yes.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Scott, I was wondering if you could help us with a couple of Cessna metrics, which could really give us a feel of how things are progressing. Notably, you had the whitetail situation shifted over the quarter, how much your slots have sold out in 2011, and what you think the book to bill might be this year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Rob, I don't know if I want to do too many specific numbers in there. Obviously, as we were targeting through the year, we had some concerns as a result of the market being kind of soft through the course of the year that we would have a bunch of so-called whitetails toward the end of the year. Needless to say, the vast majority of those were sold or are now spoken for. So our inventory situation in terms of finished goods at the end of year came down significantly. Our order book in terms of the percent sold slots, as we've talked about, we kind of treat that as pretty competition sensitive information. But suffice to say that we're not in a situation very different than we were last year. So there's a fair number of aircraft that are sold, but there still requires some work to go here in terms of orders that need to convert to sales in 2011 to fill out our production plan and to hit our slight increase in unit volume. But again, as we sit here, as I said with Jeff, I mean, it is a forecast, but we feel like that's a forecast that we can hit, and we'll keep working that. Yes, on the book to bill, this thing is, I think on a backlog basis, is going to go sideways here for a while. You're not going to see -- I don't think we're at the phase yet in the cycle where you're going to start to see the demand get so strong that you're really pushing out and growing for future year delivery. So I think we'll continue to burn off some of that backlog for customers that are already in the order book and will take 2000 [sic] deliveries. And I think we'll be largely this year making orders that allows us to deliver our 2011 number that we give you. And of course, we'll have some future year, but of course there'll also be still some cancellations that will play in some of the outyears as well. So again, I think at this stage in the cycle, the backlog to me is not a number I look at a whole lot. I'm really looking at what's the current order run rates and how does that deliver on '11. And that's the information, frankly, that we'll look at as we go through the year that will help us, not only think about 2011, but also set our production run rate as we get towards the back half of the year into 2012.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Your comments on the end markets seem to suggest that the U.S. has done particularly well over the last couple of months. If you look more globally, how would you make any distinctions out there? Are you seeing a good recovery elsewhere as well?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think I would say that, clearly, the bonus depreciation program -- you always have some tax incentive buying that happens at the end of the year in the U.S., primarily, anyway. And I think the bonus depreciation helped to fuel that. But even outside the U.S., the stability in Europe, Asia, I mean just having the global economic markets to be pretty stable here for the last six months has resulted in some strength and order flow starting to come out of those regions. So we did see a stronger bias here in the fourth quarter towards U.S. orders, and I would say largely because of the bonus depreciation coming out. But we also saw a reasonable order flow from the rest of the world. And again, I think that's just, generally speaking, the economic environment has been pretty stable here for the last six months.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And just finally at Bell, you saw a strong quarter for FMS sales there. What helicopter does that relate to, and how do you expect that to progress next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Our FMS stuff usually is a blend between 412s and 407s, and I would expect that to continue going forward.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank", "The R&D pickup and the CapEx pickup, can you give some color there, what exactly is going on, maybe split it up by business, what's the big driver of both of the pickups in both of those things?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. The vast majority of that is Cessna and Bell. We have announced, obviously, the Citation Ten at Cessna. We haven't announced specific programs. But as we have talked about, we do have a number of upgrade programs and a couple of clean slate aircraft programs that are underway at Cessna. Similarly at Bell, we have a number of upgrade programs. Some that have been announced, some that will be announced shortly, as well as some work that we're doing to sort of add-on to the family of helicopters at Bell. So as you look into 2011, and going forward, the level of R&D activity at Cessna and Bell is up significantly. That's the bulk of the number. So there's a modest increase in Industrial with some new product planned, and Systems is fairly stable at this point, I'd say.", "Douglas Wilburne", "And then, David, the CapEx is tooling and other spending related to those programs that Scott described.", "David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank", "And then on V-22. Obviously, you're under a multiyear contract, which gives you a fair amount of protection from any potential cancellation of the perm. But how do you feel about the potential risk that, given pressures on the budget, that the Marine Corps could look to stretch out the program and rather than rates continuing to go higher, maybe actually even drop or just flatten out?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I can tell you that, I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty, David. I'm always reluctant to say anything definitive here about the Defense Budget. We all know there's a lot going on right now in the Pentagon. But at least so far, the discussions around V-22 have been as they have been the last couple of years, which is the Marine Corps demand, the Air Force demand, the utilization of this air vehicle. It's a very, very unique asset, and we have not seen any indications from our customer about a desire to slow down or change the program of record for the aircraft. So it's just all I can tell you as of now, that is not something that's been put on the table in terms of a budget issue.", "David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank", "And last one for me, the smaller loss at TFC, obviously, the portfolio is strong. But what are you assuming for loss provisioning and just losses in the portfolio in 2011?", "Scott Donnelly", "I mean, obviously, we've done a lot of loss provisioning here over the last couple years with many of these assets, particularly in the Golf and the Timeshare world. But we are expecting that, net this year, we're going to see something probably around that $140 million of losses flow through the business.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Alexander Virgo", "It's Alex Virgo for Julian. I guess I just wanted to dig a little deeper on the incrementals at Cessna. If you could talk about maybe an update on the production shift in Mexico and give us maybe some color on how we should think about that this year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, specifically around the Mexico, that transition continues. We've made a lot of progress in terms of facilities. We've moved a number of items down there. So we're continuing to develop the workforce. And that program that we announced in terms of part of our overall restructuring has been moving full speed ahead. And that's true with Cessna, as well as Bell.", "Alexander Virgo", "And in terms of how we should think about incrementals at Cessna this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "In terms of the revenue line outs or...", "Alexander Virgo", "I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more detail on how we can go from a very good top line guide to I guess slightly lighter than maybe we had expected on the bottom line.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, Alex, depending how you're looking at it, the thing that's really going to continue to be a drive for us is we are not going to see in 2011 a significant change in our production run rates. And so when you look at overhead absorption, inefficiencies in the factory, it does not have a marked change in '11 from '10 because the underlying production run rates are not significantly different. So there's a lot of stuff that we've been doing, obviously, on the cost front, but we also at some point need to have some volume grow to drive some efficiencies through those factories, in addition to, obviously, the transitions we're making in trying to put places in lower labor costs. But I think if you look at 2011, people do have to keep in mind, we are still running at very low production run rates.", "Operator", "Next we move to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was wondering if you could size, in Cessna in the quarter, the headwind on deposit forfeitures and used aircraft write-downs. And also on the used sides, what you're looking for in terms of -- or building in any headwind there or write-downs there into next year's guidance?", "Frank Connor", "So for the quarter, the forfeiture number was $5 million relative to $17 million a year ago. And used aircraft write-downs was $9 million, and there was no used aircraft write-down a year ago. So those are kind of the headwind numbers, so $20 million-plus of headwind. In terms of this year, we kind of planned the year without a lot of kind of headwind related to used or benefit of forfeiture. Frankly, we kind of, we planned it expecting those would offset each other.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then with respect to TFC, I know it's beyond the current forecast, but is it potentially in the cards for a breakeven in '12? Or does that look more like a '13 event at this point?", "Frank Connor", "Well, as we've talked about, we think that this process is going to go on for a while, and we've always talked about kind of being able to liquidate within our capital cushion and having some excess available. And if you run through those numbers, it does not suggest a breakeven in 2012. So it suggests that we will continue to have losses at TFC in 2012.  As we continue to wind it down, we think obviously that loss curve is going to continue to decline and decline quite rapidly, reflective of this year's numbers relative to last year's numbers. But we do expect that it will continue to be a drag on the non-captive business in 2012. The captive business, we will expect kind of will be around kind of breakeven-ish type levels for this year, and then we are working towards, obviously, profitability out in the '12 and beyond time frame.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "And last one for me, with respect to the backlog at Cessna, are you starting or can you give some color around the order uptake you're seeing on the Citation Ten? And also, is the CJ4 still about 40% of that backlog or has that significantly moved around?", "Scott Donnelly", "So around Citation Ten, we have a lot conversations going on with a number of Citation Ten, both prospective customers as well as a number of fleet operators, guys that want a number of Tens. And really this program is kind of aimed a lot around that community, in giving them an upgrade path as they go forward. So those conversations are in process as we speak. And overall, the reception is kind of exactly what we expect it to be and very well-received. In terms of the backlog percent at CJ4, I don't know that I have that number in front of me. I will tell you that CJ4 is ramping through production volumes in 2011 as we expected it to do. So we saw about 18 in this year and that will elevate as we go forward.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "The number of the pre-owned Cessna in production planes as a percent of the population came down a lot in the January numbers, some 80 bps sequentially. And one of the avionics suppliers indicates that the number of whitetails, of which you're a major part of the fleet, went from 65 at the end of September to 10. Is that guidance essentially representative of the pattern of what you saw? And with those two metrics, it would suggest that, basically, demand got a lot better toward the end of the year. Some of that's seasonality. But can you comment sort of how things went throughout the quarter and kind of the pricing environment must be substantially less gory today than it was going into the fourth quarter. Is that correct?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think most of what you just said is true, Cai. I mean, there's a lot of different people saying a lot of different things about what's going on in the business jet world out there. But the phenomenon that we saw absolutely was we forecasted a year and ran a production run rate based around that. It was not linear by any stretch of the imagination, right? It disappointed for easily the first nine months of the year versus what we would have expected the recovery to look like as we went into last year. But it finished the year very strong. And so the whitetails that we were very nervous about -- and as I said before, we took the inventory risk on doing that as we went through the year because we can't build these things in short cycle. We need to sort of forecast them and build to that. We caught up a fair number of those things as we went really through November and December. And as you say, there is a natural cyclicality to this thing, but obviously it was much stronger in terms of the strength of that cycle in the last couple of months than you would normally expect. And that did kind of bring our total year forecast and inventory views and whatnot back pretty close to where we expect them to be as a result of the strength in November, December.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Your current discussions with potential customers, is the pricing environment, I would think it would be a little bit better today than it was kind of in the October time frame. Is that correct?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it's better than it has been through the course of the year. I mean, I think there were some cases where people were out there trying to move aircraft at any cost. And so if people were really looking to try to get a bottom of the cycle pricing deal done, they were trying to do that as we went through the mid-part, early to mid-part of this year. So yes, I would say that pricing did firm up a little bit as we went into the last couple months, and we would hope that and expect to see some price firming as we go forward through 2011. I think it's part of the natural course of the cycle.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "If you look at your R&D, while it was down last year and actually down the year before, the biggest chunk is at Cessna, and basically its volume has come down a lot. Is it fair to estimate that your R&D to sales ratio at Cessna was up some 100 to 200 bps last year and will be up another 50 or so this year? Is that the pattern, because that's what it looks like?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it is, Cai. The numbers we're giving you obviously are absolute numbers. But it's safe to say that the Cessna numbers are at a very high level compared to historicals and growing in terms of percent of sales. But we think this is a necessary action for us to take because, again, the market does go through these cycles and the development cycle of an aircraft does not fit well in these cycles. And so we're clearly in a situation where, to make the right investments and do the right things in anticipation of the needs of the business going forward are just not lining up with where we happen to be in the cycle. And I think from a mid- to long-term perspective for the business, we need to go invest in these programs. And that is, for sure, driving very high R&D as a percent of sales numbers and putting some headwind on the margin. But it's numbers. And we've talked a little before, I think it's something we need to go do and, obviously, we're pulling the trigger on that.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Last question. Industrial, while it was up year-over-year, the margins were down fairly substantially from the third quarter. And kind of looking back over prior years, some years the fourth quarter was better than the third with the auto shutdown, and some it wasn't. Was there anything weird in that? Why was it down as much as it was from the third?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, there is some -- as you note, there is some natural cyclicality in terms of the margin rates in the fourth quarter and what's going on with the OEMs and whatnot. But we did have, in this quarter, a couple of situations where we've had warranty issues that had been hanging out there with a couple of key customers for some time. And in my view, you always have these debates back and forth as to who's responsible. And the bottom line is a couple of these have been hanging out there for some time. I don't think it helps our customer relationship having these things out there, and we chose to go ahead and resolve a couple of them in the quarter.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And approximately how big was the warranty cleanup in the fourth quarter, and is there still an overhang going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don't think I want to put the number out there specifically, but it was a couple specific items. And I would say, I don't see -- I mean, we always have warranty issues that are there and accrued and reserved and whatnot. And I don't see any particular significant ones going forward. There's always going to be warranty issues coming in and out of that business. But I wouldn't expect that a couple items we resolved in the fourth quarter would tend to repeat themselves.", "Operator", "And next we go to the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Actually, I want to dovetail off of some of Cai's questions. Just to be clear, when does R&D peak for Cessna? Is it in '11 or is it in '12?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think probably, Heidi, it's more like in the '12, '13 time frame. We actually, to be honest, spent a little bit less than we expected this year. But it's mostly driven by the fact we were just bringing people on board and ramping up the programs. Next year, the number steps up significantly, in part because those programs are on our ramp. And in part, as Frank indicated, we get to the point here now where you get the program mature to the point where you're building prototypes and you're going to start flight testing. So I think that, in terms of modeling this thing, '11 is certainly not the peak. Both Cessna and Bell, you'll see it ramp up through '11 and continue to see it ramp from '12 into '13 as we really enter into the kind of programs peaking in terms of their consumption of resources in terms of both expense and capital as we build prototypes and really enter into flight test programs.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "And then is it fair then, as we think of NBAA '11 that, that's where we'll see the product introduction that would explain the higher R&D in '12 and '13 then?", "Scott Donnelly", "Heidi, the one thing I'd point out is that, how we choose and when we choose to make the commercial announcement out to the marketplace is really going to be more based upon our view of the receptiveness of the market and ready to start to generate orders as opposed to the state of the program. I mean, as you know, sometimes people will go out and announce aircraft that aren't going to deliver until five years from now. And in a very strong market, maybe that makes sense to do that, and you generate a bunch of backlog and orders. But I think at this point, we're going to be more based on what we think the market environment is and how much order generation will that drive as opposed to necessarily the maturity of where the program is. So we'll drive the programs full speed ahead and make the commercial announcements when we think the receptivity in the market is at the right time.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "And then a last part following on that, Scott, and to a bigger picture strategy question for you. Can you remind us about your thoughts about the future of the Cessna brand? I mean, you canceled Columbus. It looks like you're somewhat ceding some market share to this new entrant, Embraer, that has, obviously, ambitions to offer product across the various niches. So how do you feel is the best way to defend against their sort of broader product strategy approach towards attacking your market?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Heidi, I mean, that's really what's driving, unfortunately, and part of what drove Columbus, was we saw a shift in the marketplace at that time. We understood the market settling down. We also understand that as that market comes back, you do see new entrants like Embraer, and they're dropping some new aircraft in the market where our aircraft historically have lived. And that's part of what's driving a lot of the investments that we're making. So we see the Mustang has been hugely successful. The CJ4 is having a ton of success in the market. But we also know that, as they come into those spaces, as well as up with the 450, 500, that we need to make the right investments, and again, both upgrades as well as clean slate aircraft, in that core space. And so that's why we've decided on really given where the market is, we need to make the investments in that light to midsized jet market and put off to another day any expansion of that portfolio into the larger aircraft like you would look at with a Columbus.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "More Cessna questions. Scott, when we go into this next upturn, how do you expect the pricing environment to be, be it that there are more competitors in the market. And do you think the pricing environment for business jets will be tougher?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, I guess almost by definition, if you've got new competitors, you're going to have tougher pricing. I still think this is a market that, when you look at the cost basis out there given the global supply environment, a lot of the key people, it's hard to see that one competitor versus another is going to have some radical different cost basis than the other guys. I mean, we largely buy propulsion from the same environment, buy avionics from the same different suppliers. It is kind of a global cost base, if you will. And obviously, in the places where there's labor differentiation, we're taking action to make sure that we're not disadvantaged there. But this is a market that, historically, has been pretty rational in terms of pricing, and I would expect it to be that way. I think we shouldn't have expectations over the next few years that you're going to see pricing like you saw in '05, '06, '07, where you had this massive supply and demand imbalance going on. But would I expect that we'll see some pricing return to the marketplace? Yes, I do.", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I think in your remarks before you mentioned that there's been discussions with kind of the traditional fleet buyers. I'm assuming they're the fractional operators, I mean, do you see them back into the market again?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, when I'm talking about our customers, I'm really talking more about corporate operators, guys that have multiple fleets, as well as investment driver fleet obviously, which are the single-owner type operators. Those are the folks that are looking at the roll. I think the fractional guys are going to have a similar challenge. But frankly, right now, there's more capacity out there than there needs to be. So I think most of the folks right now in the fractional world is going to be how do you consume that capacity over the next two or three years before people start thinking about really feeling pressured to do a lot of fleet renewal.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.", "Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers", "Just one quick sort of follow-up on the Bell commercial demand. And your discussion of Cessna demand progression over the course of the year was really helpful. I wonder if you could provide us some sort of similar color on what you're seeing in terms of discussions with your customers, what sort of buried into the outlook for 2011? Some of your peers have said they expect '11 to be weak and '12's where they really get the recovery. What are you seeing, and how do you expect that to progress over the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "This is on the Bell side?", "Carter Copeland - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, Bell commercial.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Bell was more stable on the commercial side, I would say, than Cessna was. We saw continued strength in emergency medical services and areas like that. So it was not as cyclical or quite as much change over the course of the year. Although as we finished, I'd say we finished pretty strong and feel pretty good about the market. The Bell, of course, the fourth quarter were also driven by the fact that we have the 429 coming in, right? So production rates are ramping up on that, deliveries grew dramatically in the fourth quarter, and we expect them to grow significantly as we go through 2011. So that helps a lot in terms of our view of having a stronger 2011 than we did '10. So I'm not sure. I haven't read what some of the other guys are saying. But I guess my view is we still see '11 as modestly better than we saw in 2010, and the market continuing to strengthen going through '12. But I certainly don't see or have any indication or belief in the market that we see to believe that 2011 should be softer than 2010 in terms of demand for commercial helicopters.", "Frank Connor", "And we've been saying that for a while. That's not new news. We did have a stronger fourth quarter, to some extent, than we expected, and we're still expecting to be up slightly from there for '11. And so that's really consistent.", "Operator", "Next we have a question from the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Stephen Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Have you given any thought to consolidating or packaging the remaining non-captive finance receivables and monetizing them in some way?", "Scott Donnelly", "Was that an offer?", "Stephen Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Not from me. Not my business.", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think I would say that we don't see a market out there right now where the types of assets we have appeals to some buyer that would say, hey, we're interested in doing a deal for this whole asset class. I do think that as we go forward, whereas we've had a lot of the run-off to date has been our Distribution Finance business, which is relatively short cycle and moving out and small bits of our ABL moving out, that as we go forward there may or may not be opportunities to sell pieces of the portfolio. And obviously, we have people talk to us and we talk to people all the time about bits of that. But I think if anything like that happens, it's going to be in pieces of the portfolio. I really don't envision any buyer or the financial service entity out there that would want to take on the whole breadth of the asset classes that we have.", "Stephen Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And can you talk for a minute with the general aviation rules changing some in China, what you see as the opportunities there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, most of the talk right now is around opening what we would consider relatively low airspace. So they're talking about 1,000 or even 3,000 meters and below. So this is really a market that is good for that country to start to build GA because it really does open up air space for people to learn to fly. You're talking about primarily single-engine prop aircraft, which is obviously part of our market and very good position there today. But I think to see it really drive a lot more general aviation with respect to the jet business, you're going to have to see more liberalization of the en route flying at 30,000, 40,000 feet like you do in the rest of the world. And there's a lot of talk about doing that, and I think they are making progress on trying to make that happen. But most of the stuff you read in the papers, when they're saying GA and opening up airspace, this is low-altitude airspace, which is also good for helicopters. So I think that's a segment that's seeing the growth more immediately.", "Operator", "Next is the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Sorry if I missed this. Did you guys talk about what the absolute order number was in the quarter for units?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, you didn't miss it. But we haven't been doing that.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then just on realized price at Cessna in the quarter, was that up or down?", "Scott Donnelly", "Actually, there was some slight price realization.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And so you would expect that to continue into 2011?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I do, Steve. I think that the commercial price that we've seen has stabilized, and I would expect some modest improvements to that as we go forward. Again, I don't think we should go back and model what we saw in the heyday because supply-demand is clearly more aligned at this point, but I do think we'll see some continued price stability and maybe some modest improvement.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then one last one. Where would you see the first quarter play out from a delivery perspective? Or is there anything, I guess, from a higher level that we should think about with regards to the first quarter for total Textron, if there's anything unusual seasonally or you're just not getting some delivery at Cessna into the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure that everybody's kind of on the same page about what happens here seasonally in the first quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think you should expect, from a Cessna perspective, a soft first quarter. I mean, the first quarter is generally pretty soft, and it's not driven by any desire -- we had to pull things in necessarily but, obviously, you always get some tax incentive stuff happen in the fourth quarter. So I would think as you look at 2011 in total, it's going to start soft, but that's our plan would be to start soft. So I would not expect great things from Cessna in terms of earnings contributions in Q1, if that's kind of where you're going.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So you'll lose money in Cessna Q1?", "Scott Donnelly", "In all likelihood, yes.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And nothing else in the other businesses?", "Scott Donnelly", "Nothing in particular, I don't think.", "Frank Connor", "The other thing I'd just say in terms of the quarterly progression is keep in mind that Systems, given the kind of timing of SFW shipments, there's going to be kind of lumpiness and volatility in and around their quarterly results.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc", "I was wondering if you could just generally talk or characterize the contracting environment on the Systems side, and generally just with the DoD, and talk a little bit about potential margin outlook over time for the Systems business and your interactions with the DoD on margins? And then, as well on the pace of program awards and whether we're continuing to see, just generally speaking, program award delays or whether we're seeing that process play itself out now and seeing a normalization of program awards?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, in terms of price negotiation, is there a heightened sensitivity in the Pentagon [indiscernible]? Absolutely. But as we've had negotiations and we work our way through it, I think by and large, we're ending up in a position that's a fair price on the contracts that we're negotiating. In terms of the time and the difficulty with getting contracts definitized, it is continuing to be extraordinarily slow. In fact, the use of what they refer to as an undefinitized contract authorization in order to get work going has become virtually standard because you just can't get through the audits associated with a negotiation for a contract. They just stay open for very, very long periods of time. It's enormously counterproductive. It's driving a lot of cost in the business. I think it's driving an enormous amount of cost in the government. And that process is, in my view, just horribly flawed. But eventually you do get there and you end up with a contract.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc", "Would you characterize that, the latter part of your statement there, is continuing to get worse or is it kind of it is what it is and it's not necessarily getting worse or it's not necessarily getting better?", "Scott Donnelly", "It's certainly not getting better.", "Douglas Wilburne", "All right.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Wilburne", "Thank you, Ruth, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to first quarter results, which appear on Slide 3 of the presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $2.7 billion, up 0.7% from a year ago, which yielded earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.29 compared to income of $0.27 in the second quarter of 2010. Last year's results included $0.02 in special charges. Second quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $171 million compared to $186 million during last year's second quarter. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I'll start by saying results in the second quarter improved over first quarter, including a return to operating profitability of Cessna, primarily reflecting an increase in aircraft deliveries and aftermarket volumes. ", "As you know, at the end of May, we hired Scott Ernest, as the new CEO at Cessna. And we're excited to have Scott on board. His strong leadership, his deep industry experience and focus on talent development should have a meaningful impact on growth and performance success going forward. He's already implemented a regular integrated operations review cadence focused on improving the accountability and cross-functional coordination in the business. ", "On the market front, we saw an increase in gross orders from both the first quarter and last year's second quarter. Availability of used Citations also continue to improve, dropping to 13.7% of the installed fleet from 14% in the last quarter, and a high in the cycle of 17.3%.", "Aircraft usage was also up in the quarter with average daily utilization reaching 0.71 hours compared 0.68 last quarter and a year ago. The higher usage also helped drive an increase in our aftermarket revenues in the quarter. Based on overall customer activity and the availability of U.S. bonds depreciation tax treatment for orders placed by the end of the year, we're still planning for full year jet deliveries to be slightly higher than last year.", "Moving to Bell. Performance was particularly strong with second quarter margins of 13.8%, reflecting solid execution especially on our military program ramp-ups. We delivered 9 V-22s and H-1s versus 8 V-22s and 3 H-1s in the second quarter of 2010. ", "Looking into the future, we've begun a number of preliminary discussions with potential foreign military customers for these 2 aircraft, and we continue to discuss the next multiyear contract with our U.S. DoD customer.", "Our OH-58 Kiowa Warrior upgrade program is also progressing as we delivered the first A2D replacement cabin to the army. This is the first of 19 cabin conversions under contract. And we're currently working with the army on potential new cabins to replace those units in the fleet that have incurred wartime damage. The Kiowa Warrior platform is important to the Army, and we're making investments to modernize the design to meet the army's future requirements. ", "In fact, last month, our OH-58 Block II prototype demonstrators successfully proved hover out of ground effect at maximum gross weight of 5,500 pounds and an altitude of 6,000 feet in a 95 degree environment, a critical milestone for this project.", "On the commercial side of the business, we delivered 22 commercial helicopters in the quarter, up from 21 a year ago. And we're working a significant number of active prospects around the world. Customers' interest was decidedly better at this year's Paris Air Show as we signed contracts for 18 aircraft. We also displayed our new 407GX and 407 AH models at the show. This marked the beginning of an international tour for the GX and the AH, highlighting their capabilities to customers in Europe and the Middle East. These helicopters are receiving positive feedback and interest from customers worldwide.", "On the aftermarket front, Bell continues to expand its service footprint. Last month, we broke ground on a new joint Bell Cessna service facility in Singapore, which will support our growing base in Asia. Expanding our service footprint enables us to continue to provide top-ranked service capabilities to our customers wherever they fly around the world. Overall, our commercial helicopter outlook is promising as we leverage our market-leading customer support with our renewed commitment to new product development. ", "The Textron Systems revenues were down in the quarter primarily reflecting lower UAS deliveries and lower mission support volume. Much of the lower UAS revenue was really the timing of programs throughout the year, and we continue to expect full year systems revenues in nearly $2 billion. ", "On the ASV front, we were awarded an undefinitized contract for 440 units from the Afghan National Army. The base contract calls for 240 ASVs. The program also includes options for another 200 vehicles, as well as options for training and logistics support through 2014. In total, the contract and options are worth $525 million.", "Moving to our Finance segment. We reduced our operating loss to $33 million in the quarter, an improvement of $38 million from a year ago. We liquidated $317 million of financial receivables during the quarter, reducing our total portfolio to $3.8 billion, with non-captive portion decreasing to $1.7 billion. Obviously, the pace of liquidation is slowing a bit as our remaining non-captive portfolio becomes smaller and the mix of assets have longer variations. Going forward, we will continue to actively liquidate the portfolio as quickly as possible balancing economics and risk mitigation.", "Moving to Industrial. Revenues were up slightly, but volumes were approximately flat as we saw a modest automotive impact during the quarter due to events in Japan. The higher revenues were primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, and operating performance was solid on a flat volume margins of 7.6%.", "To wrap up the quarter, we continued to make progress with downsizing our Finance business. We posted solid results in Industrial and systems. Bell's execution on the ramp up of V-22 and H-1 continues to be very favorable. And at Cessna, I believe we're taking the right actions to position this business for the future.", "Across all of our businesses, we continue to invest aggressively in new products and services. And as we look to the rest of the year, we expect commercial aircraft deliveries to be up significantly in the second half, similar to last year. As a result, we continue to expect slightly higher full year deliveries versus 2010. ", "Overall, we are on track for a full year EPS outlook of $1 to $1.15 and cash flow before pension contributions of between $800 million and $850 million. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $196 million, up $35 million from the second quarter of 2010. ", "Let's look at how each of the segments contributed to this improvement starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were up $17 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to growth in our aftermarket business. Jet deliveries of 38 units were down from 43 in last year's second quarter. We posted an operating profit of $5 million which compared to $3 million last year. The improvement reflected profit on higher aftermarket sales, partially offset by higher engineering and development costs. At Bell, revenues were up $49 million on higher deliveries.", "Segment profit increased $12 million reflecting improved performance on the higher volume. At Textron Systems, revenue was down $82 million reflecting the lower UAS and mission support volume in the quarter. Segment profit was down $21 million on the lower revenues.", "At Industrial, revenues were up $58 million, primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange as volumes were essentially flat, as Scott mentioned. We generated an increase in segment profit of $4 million on the higher revenues.", "Finance segment revenues were down $23 million, reflecting our ongoing liquidation activities. Our operating loss improvement of $38 million reflected lower loan loss provisions and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower interest margin on the reduced portfolio of finance receivables.", "Looking at Slide 5, non-accrual finance receivables decreased from $836 million to $696 million, and 60-day-plus delinquencies decreased to $302 million from $418 million. Charge-offs in the second quarter were $38 million compared with $16 million in the first quarter of 2011.", "Moving below the segment level. Corporate expenses were $23 million, up from $17 million last year primarily due to the impact of our share price add on compensation expense. Interest expense was $38 million, up $4 million from last year, primarily the result of lower interest income from the TFC intercompany loan. ", "With respect to taxes, our tax rate of 31.9% is up from last year's rate of 18.2%, primarily because last year's second quarter benefited from a number of discrete foreign tax items. On the cash flow front, we contributed $189 million into our pension plan during the quarter. We also reduced our TFC bank line by $690 million, ending the quarter with a remaining balance of $500 million.", "With our solid manufacturing cash flow and receivables liquidations, we reduced our consolidated net debt by another $288 million, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion of total debt, which you can see on Slide 6.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of Peter Skibitski with SunTrust.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "So I want to ask about Citation deliveries being down in the quarter year-over-year. Would you say the market is weaker now than it was last year? Or do you think it's just a timing issue? Or would there be some other reason they'd be down?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think the market, Pete, is modestly recovering. I think our gross orders being improved both year-over-year and over the first quarter are good indications that it continues to improve. We use the word stable. It's not rocketing back, I mean, certainly, the level of customer interest and number of orders we're able to book is improved over both those periods. And it feels like that will continue. So in terms of actual numbers, I mean, we're always going to -- I mean, as you know, our guidance for the year is to be slightly up. So we're going to see a little bit of above and beyond on a quarter-to-quarter basis here. But I don't think there's anything that is particularly concerning in that respect. I think, that's mostly just timing. There has been a little bit of positive mix towards the larger aircraft than the smaller aircraft, which is helpful to us particularly from a margin perspective. So I would say that the market is continuing to behave about as we expected it for this year, and with, generally speaking, modest improvement.", "Frank Connor", "I'd just point out in a detail. If you look at it, the Mustang is what really drove the decrease. In the larger cabin size in our markets, it's certainly stronger on a delivery basis as well.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Got you. What's your guys' sense of when cancellations will have trough? You're obviously still at getting some. And I'm just wondering if we're at the bottom in that regard or what your perspective is on that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I guess my perspective is that it is bottoming this year. Right? I mean, I would expect we will still see some trickle of cancellations through the balance of this year. And I think that's probably just about it. Most of the range of a lot of the long-term order books that were out there are pretty well drawn at this point.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Understood. If I can sneak in one last one. Can you make some comments about CJ4 profitability? You delivered the same this quarter as Q1. Was the loss on those planes the same? Or have you been able to improve profitability on CJ4 already? I mean, any comments there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, CJ4 was modestly improved from last quarter. We're coming down the learning curve in terms of our labor. And so, I think we're continuing to make progress there. We have been working, as we mentioned before, with a number of our suppliers. These are not things that turn overnight, but I would say that we have come to terms with a number of suppliers in terms of trying to get the cost in line. And that input stream, if you will, from those suppliers at a lower cost will sort of feather in over the balance of the year.", "Peter Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Would you be willing to say when you think it could turn positive?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, I think we are positive in terms of what we generate in terms of the contribution margin rate, but we'll see the number continue to improve through the course of the year.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I'm going to try the Cessna demand question a different way. Last year early in the year, you guys made some encouraging comments. And then, we had European sovereign debt and a 15% pullback in the equity market, and everything shut off. We've all kind of been sitting at our desks getting a slew of less positive macro data. It sounds like your tone though is not really changing, and that you haven't felt the impact of that. You're still seeing things get better. Is that the case? And maybe, if you could even talk to kind of quarter-to-date very recent activity, just so we can get a sense of whether or not things are changing because it's very dynamic.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean it is dynamic, Noah. And I wouldn't disagree with you. I mean, I think if you looked at how we felt last year through about the first 5 months of the year, we're similar, right? It was modest improvement over 2009, and you're absolutely right. I mean, from sort of June through the September, October time frame, the market just absolutely stopped. And I think that was reflected in what our deliveries looked like in the third quarter last year. It was very, very tough to get any kind of a momentum in the marketplace. I would say, where we sit this year -- the reason I say, look, it's modestly improved, right? It's not taking off. But I certainly have not seen any indications in the market in terms of customer discussions and level of activity that would indicate that things are going to be like they were last year in sort of the June to September time frame, the customer activity, the rate of order. Booking is maintaining positive momentum at this point. I mean, if something as dramatic as what happened at the macroeconomic level that happened last year, of course, the industry would be affected by that. But I don't think it's reached that point.", "Frank Connor", "And in terms of what's happening so far in the quarter, Noah, as we prepare for this call, we obviously make sure that whatever comments we're going to make are as up-to-date as possible. So when we say that we continue to see deliveries up slightly from last year, that's based on the sentiment as it exists now.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, great. And then, on the margins there, obviously, that's dynamic as well with the changes you've made in the business. We made a little money in the second quarter. Can you maybe just help us with the progression there in the back half?", "Frank Connor", "Well, Noah, what we had indicated for guidance was 1% to 3% margins. For Cessna, we said on the last call, we thought we'd be probably leaning towards the lower end of that range. And I think that, that's kind of still where we are, the lower half of that range. And kind of the progression will obviously depend on the delivery volume ramp that we expect to see. But that's how the full year maps up.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research, Pennsylvania (sic) [ Partners ].", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "Vertical Research Partners. Scott, just one more question on Cessna, and I'll switch gears to something else. Given what you just said about kind of the tone of things, do you expect your back half to be a little more level loaded then, and not have such a crush and Q4 to get to the number?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I do. I mean, I think there's 2 things at play, Jeff. One is we've been trying as hard as we can to try to -- to the extent we can, move people that would rather be fourth quarter than third quarter just because operationally, it puts an awful lot of pressure on the operation to try to deliver everything at the end of Q4. And of course, the other dynamic is I don't think we're going to have this dearth of orders and activity that we saw last year in sort of the late spring to beginning of summer, which also obviously impacted the softness of last year's Q3. So I won't tell you that I don't think it's still going to be Q4 will be the more heavily loaded. But that's very -- that's typical of the business anyway. But I do not think that Q3 will be as light as it was last year.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "And I guess the second part to the same question, I mean, the backlog, obviously, going into the back half is a lot lower than it was going into the back half of last year. Is most of what you're expecting in the back half kind of in sight in the backlog? Or how much backfilling is there to be done?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I would say, it's either in the backlog or it's largely in customers that we have line of sight to the aircraft deliveries.", "Jeffrey Sprague - Citigroup", "I just want to switch gears to Bell margins. Certainly, you've kind of continued to beat my expectations there. Can you just give us a little bit granularity on kind of -- even if it's directionally, not specifically, but kind of the margins on military programs and maybe the effect of aftermarket on what we're seeing in margins and where we should expect them to kind of -- what kind of trajectory we should expect from here?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think clearly, our margin rates on the military programs have been improving. And there's a real mix in there, Jeff, of programs that have had solid margins for some time. And there are a couple of programs in there that frankly have had in some sorts negative margin, certainly very dilutive margins. And those programs, as they improve, and get back to where they should be, we reduce the amount of that dilution from a couple of those programs. Our aftermarket business obviously is still very strong and a very profitable business. And so, when you look at all this stuff, as we made improvements from a couple of these programs that have had real challenges in the past in terms of the margin rate and get them to sort of more healthy what you would expect to be good margin rates up in that sort of, in the military, 9% or 10% or so kind of numbers, you will lose the drag of that dilution. And you get a lot more of -- obviously, an overall stronger margin rate in the business. And I think that's what we're seeing. Now as we go forward, through the balance of the year, I think we're going to see fairly level in terms of our military deliveries. But we're going to see a significant increase in commercial deliveries through the back half of the year. And again, those, generally speaking, tend to be dilutive to that 13% kind of margin rate in new equipment. But that's more as the commercial market works, right? We got reasonable margins on most of those products, but they feed that aftermarket, which has strong margins. So I think that's the pressure point we're going to see. We'll a lot of 429 deliveries, a lot more the light 407, 206-type deliveries in the second half. And that's great. That builds our backlog. They're good products. They're decent margins, but they're not 13%, 14% kind of margin products.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "If I could shift back to Cessna, a couple of questions. Could you give us some color please, Scott, in terms of what you're seeing in pricing, the mix between U.S. and foreign demand? And lastly, what should we expect Scott Ernest to be doing differently at Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I guess, Cai, I would say let's first talk about the pricing side of things. So pricing in the used market, I would say, was fairly stable. There's a couple of models that moved down again. But generally speaking, most of the models, particularly most of the newer models, we've seen stabilization, even some increases in pricing, and I guess I'd also comment, much better volume. I mean, there's a lot more activity in the used market. So I think that has gone through the trough and is starting to improve. On the new aircraft front, pricing is still difficult. I mean, every deal is a very competitive deal but we're hanging in there. I don't think it's degrading a lot, but we saw a little bit of positive pricing through the earlier part of the year. But it's going to be tough pricing I think still for a while as the market is recovering. If I looked at the market in terms of where it's coming from, the orders and then talk to deliveries, I guess probably is the better way to look at it through the first half is about 65-35 domestic versus international. So I think this is going to fluctuate a little bit obviously over time. But it's -- I think long-term, it's still going to hang around the 50-50 mark over a period of time. In terms of my expectations for Scott and what Scott's doing is -- look, Scott is a pretty hands-on guy. He loves the business. He's a guy that's intending to obviously spend virtually all of his time right now, in Wichita, very inside focused on how do we look and measure and build a cadence around manufacturing, around sales, around service, day in day out kind of operations. He's very much digging into that. We've been looking at the organization and what we think we need to do. Organizationally, he's put some people into new jobs on his staff, particularly people focused around particular product lines like Citation jets, like our single-engine business, like our special mission business to drive more accountability, more sort of P&L responsibility, across these product lines, and that includes upstream marketing, so product development, product strategy and really having people that own those individual product segments as opposed to running the business all as sort of one chunk. And I think, that's something we've needed. I think it's a great opportunity for some people, and he has people coming into work every day that are very, very focused on those particular product segments. And of course, they continue to work through manufacturing and engineering on all the overall efficiencies and cost programs. So he's a pretty hands-on guy. He's a decisive guy. So I mean, you put issues on the table and the team will make the calls they need to make. And again, I think, he's great with identifying talent, putting the right people in the right jobs and giving them the right opportunities. And good things happen when that works.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Terrific. And just one last one, shifting to TFC. You had very impressive improvement in nonperforming asset and 60-day delinquency ratios, sequentially. Could you give us a little bit more color what's happening there? What was the cash conversion in the quarter? And are the prospects to maybe unload some bigger pieces of this improved given the improvement you have in some of those metrics?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the cash conversion was around 80%, Cai. And that was -- we've been telling folks that we expect to see some quarters when that number comes down like that, at that number or even below that number. In this case, it was driven by one particular account we've had. It's been a problem account for some time, and it just went through a bankruptcy process so we took a charge-off, for which we were reserved. That also explains why the charge-off number was up a little bit in the quarter and of course, takes that out of accrual, out of nonaccrual. I think what you're going to see, going forward, Cai, and it was typical this quarter is that the portfolio, I would dare to say at this point, has sort of stabilized. Right? So the problem accounts, we've pretty well gone through and said, \"Okay, look, these are the accounts that are nonaccrual. These are the accounts that are problem accounts. We're working our way through those.\" As we work our way through those, the good news is what we're not seeing is a lot of new accounts move into those categories. So I think that the performing parts of the portfolio have stabilized. So what you see now is things that are going to migrate their way through the nonaccrual accounts, through the charge-offs for which they're reserved and see that happen without a lot of new stuff backfilling and coming back into those nonaccrual accounts. So that's sort of what's going on. In terms of prospects for moving or selling significant parts of the assets, we did one earlier this year in the timeshare area. I think it's possible that we could do something in timeshare again. We believe there's a fair bit of capital liquidity that's come back into that market. A number people that are very interested in that asset class. To be honest with you, it's been a great asset class for us. It's just not something we want to do in the future, so we do see some interest on that side. On the golf side of things, we did sell a number of golf courses particularly in Canada to a company wanted to get in that space. But I'd say there's still not a lot of capital, not a lot of liquidity coming back into the golf side. So I think if I look at how the year would play off, there's no guarantee. And obviously, we won't do a deal unless we think it's a smart deal. But there's a probability we could do something on the timeshare side, but unlikely on the golf side is the way I would handicap it.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "I guess, I'll going to go back to Cessna. Cai touched on the CSC questions I had. The cash conversion ratio is still pretty good for full year, I'd say. Can you tell us a little bit about the inventories that picked up? How much of that is finished goods, and where do you stand on white tail?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the inventory buildup, Heidi, I guess don't really think of it so much as a white tail now or would say that I feel like we're going to have much in the way of white tails at the end of the year. But obviously, our ability to run the production lines is a lot more linear than our sales forecast. So there's no question that as we work through the first couple quarters, we've been building aircraft at a particular pace. But as I said, I think we have pretty good visibility through either through what is in the backlog or through the customer prospect list and the activity that we're working on that we have pretty good line of sight that those aircraft are -- that we are building the right amount of aircraft, and we're building the right type of aircraft to meet the forecast for the total year. But that does result in some inventory build during the course of year just because of this disconnect between a fairly linear manufacturing flow and a nonlinear sales flow, which we can't line that up. I mean, there's no way we could run the production facility to meet the third and fourth quarter delivery demand only by building those things to have them in time for third, fourth quarter orders.", "Frank Connor", "And that's true at Cessna and Bell.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And then, you talked about growth in aftermarket in the quarter. Can you tell us what's the run rate for aftermarket look like? Is it going to be in Cessna about $600 million, $700 million?", "Frank Connor", "That's about right, Heidi. The second half, we're expecting to be a little bit later than the first half just based on some timing. You usually think of the aftermarket as a lot parts and so forth. But there's also the aspects of refurb-ing planes. And we had a couple of fairly large programs in the first half that actually completed in the second quarter.", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then finally, just to back out so we can get a sense as to what new aircraft performance is looking like. If we x out the aftermarket and if we were to normalize for the ramp in R&D, how much -- what would normalized margins look like year-over-year?", "Scott Donnelly", "First of all, these are normalized margins because this is how we're running the business. But R&D was --", "Heidi Wood - Morgan Stanley", "If we backed out -- I mean, but if we backed out the pickup in R&D and just looked at pure new aircraft outside of parts and others, where would margins look like from there on a year-over-year basis?", "Scott Donnelly", "How about if we tackle it this way. R&D was up $14 million at Cessna in the quarter.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell", "My question -- my first question was around the margins in Cessna. I guess your second half -- your full year guidance implies at the midpoint of the Cessna margin range for the full year around about 30% incremental margins, I think. And that's obviously against a low-teens incremental in Q2. Can you just add a bit of color around what your expectations are on costs for the second half? You mentioned that R&D was up $14 million in Q2. I think it was up $9 million in Q1. And also, in your Q1 discussion, you talked about inflation cost headwinds in Cessna in Q1. So should we assume that for the second half, those cost headwinds are largely parsing away and also the R&D ramp is less steep than it was in the first half, and that's what drives a big pickup in incrementals in the second half? Or is it just you're relying on volumes because deliveries were down in the first half and your full year guidance obviously implies a decent pickup year-on-year in the second half?", "Scott Donnelly", "The R&D rate is not going to change a lot. We have been ramping up the R&D rate, and of course, that will stick with us through the balance of the year. I think if I try to get to understand your question, I mean, clearly, the revenue, the volume is going to be significantly higher in the third and the fourth quarter. So if you take sort of the midpoint around where the overall guidance number is, and you look at where we are year-to-date, obviously, particularly after coming out of a negative number in the first quarter, obviously, that's all when we made up. But really, what drives it is we do have higher aircraft delivery volumes through the third and fourth quarter, which overcomes the increased R&D and whatnot. And as I said earlier, I think there are certainly cost actions that are kicking in, in terms of lower labor cost. We will see some benefit of some improved material pricing, particularly around the CJ4 as we work through the higher volumes of the third and fourth quarter as well. So all of that contributes basically to improve those overall margin rates in Q3 and Q4. So the net for the year, you end up in that guidance range of 1% to 3%. But it's mostly volume-driven.", "Julian Mitchell", "Got it. And then secondly, just in terms of Bell commercial. You'd mentioned that the Paris Airshow, that the term was fairly upbeat and so on. How is that -- how has the orders on commercial trended, I guess, in the first 6 months versus your expectation? I mean, obviously, commodity prices have been moving around net-net as they move up. That should be positive for your customers. But you've had some macro confusion. So maybe -- I mean is it sort of similar to Cessna where even despite all these macro changes, the overall run rate year-to-date is kind of what you thought?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it's definitely what we thought. And we've seen some backlog accretion here in the first quarters on the commercial side. And I expect we will continue to see that through the balance of the year. We always felt that it would be fairly back-end loaded in terms of commercial deliveries because we were still coming out of sort of the challenges of 2010. But I guess, on balance, I would say that the market and how the market's recovering and where the opportunities are, are pretty consistent with what our view was coming into the year. Oil and gas is still strong. EMS is still strong. Asia has been picking up, Indonesia, Middle East. The areas that we expected to be strong are, in fact, turning out to be pretty strong.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank", "Scott, at Industrial, it held up pretty well despite what happened in Japan and what's coming through in terms of auto volumes. Do you still expect to see some impact, I guess at some point this year, maybe in Q3 from the slowdown in auto volumes?", "Scott Donnelly", "This is always a tough one to gauge. Right, what happens at the OEM level. But at least, what we're still hearing from the OEMs is that they're still fairly bullish on how the balance of the year is going to go. As you say, we had a little bit -- it was a little softer than we would've thought in the second quarter. And that was primarily plant shutdowns or reduced shipped rates, mostly in North America. Of the Japanese suppliers -- for a lot of key components were going back to Japan, obviously. But so far, we're not seeing a lot of modification of forecasts coming out of the OEMs in terms of the automotive market.", "Frank Connor", "And David, we're pretty much on track with respect to our original guidance of around $2.7 billion for the Industrial in total. So as we said back in the last call, we thought we'd see a little bit of a shift out of the second quarter, which we saw. And we think we'll make that up by the end of the year.", "David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Doug, I guess that leads to my next question. Can you give a kind of a summary of where your guidance within the segments corporate, TFC has changed since the beginning of the year? I mean, I know systems, you're now talking to $2 billion versus $2.2 billion. It looks like corporate and TFC might be running a little bit better. The share count looks like it might be lower, given what happened in Q2. Can you just maybe talk about where things have changed?", "Frank Connor", "Well, I think in addition to what you said, the other aspects are that Cessna is still pretty much where we said. Bell will be a little better. You already said with Cessna. So net-net, we're kind of pretty close to where we started the year except for that shift between Cessna and Bell.", "David Strauss - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And last one for me, Scott, back to Cessna. The book-to-bill, I think, was a little bit better than most of us were expecting in the quarter. Can you give a little bit of color in terms of -- I know you're talking about it regionally. Can you talk about maybe by aircraft type, model type where you're seeing relative strength compared to -- comparatively? And then, I think you've talked about, on the last call, the book-to-bill getting to 1x by I think you said, towards at the end of year. Does that still hold?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think on the book-to-bill, David, it's still the best guess I have. I mean, I think we always felt that we would probably struggle to get to a 1:1 through the course of this year. I mean, obviously, I think, as we go into the end of the year, if it's anything like last year in terms of just sort of the customer demand behavior around both the end of this year as well as orders for next year and bonus depreciation playing into all of that, I think that is probably where we'll see that 1:1 or greater kind of a number. So in that respect -- I mean, it's still yes, obviously, but it seems to be playing out about the way that we thought. In terms of aircraft mix, we kind of expected -- and again, what we've seen is a bias towards the larger Citation jets, so XLSs and the CJs and Sovereigns, more slanted away from the Mustang. Although Mustangs are doing okay, but we expected, compared to the last couple of years, that we would start to see a move towards the larger aircraft. And that is what we're seeing.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just wanted to clarify a comment you made on the backlog. Obviously, there's timing differences as to when you're going to deliver something. So is the backlog actually in a worse position this year relative to where you were last year for current year deliveries?", "Scott Donnelly", "Steve, I have not looked at that, so I couldn't tell you one way or the other whether our percentage going into the second is appreciably different. I don't think it's significantly different. I mean, just from a day-to-day operation as we talk about the stuff, it doesn't strike me as being very different.", "Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Right, because some of the stuff is for '12 and '13 and maybe a little bit beyond. And then just I think everybody's got kind of a different methodology for doing this, and you've got obviously moving parts around aftermarket, et cetera, and the revenue base. But we're coming up with something around 20 net orders from a unit perspective this quarter. Can you just give us any kind of color around that? It would be helpful for everybody, I think.", "Scott Donnelly", "We have not been giving specific order numbers. So I don't think I want to go there. We just haven't been giving that numbers, Steve.", "Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Is there any point in time where you're going to start giving that, maybe when the backlog kind of fills up? I know it's obviously a very important number to, I think, most investors. And it would just be helpful for us to be able to gauge how this thing is going.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look. I mean, obviously, the backlog number will be out there, and we'll continue to provide that. My issue is that giving specific backlog and order numbers is also more helpful to my competitors. And I just don't think it's a number we want to put out there.", "Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Right, okay. And then just as far as the progression through the rest of the year, are you expecting anything at NBAA? I mean, I know the helicopter show was pretty good for you guys, a nice milepost in kind of the recovery. Anything at NBAA that you'd expect to be positive?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we expect obviously that we'll have a good show. We have some things that we will be talking about at the show in terms of some new product. And in terms of the market, obviously, it's very hard to call. I mean, obviously, Paris, we feel good about where the market is on the commercial helicopter side. As we continue sort of this modest recovery, on the light to mid-size, I mean, I would hope that we're picking up some momentum as you get out there into that kind of October time frame. But we certainly will be talking about some new stuff and things that we think are good for the business. And hopefully, it will be a great show.", "Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then just final question on Industrial. I know you don't like to talk about the portfolio moves that much. But clearly, the business has kind of come back off of the bottom. You have a little bit of profitability there. There is quite a bit of private equity money that's floating around. Is there any kind of active ongoing portfolio review? And I guess, if you don't want to kind of answer it that way, is there any intention to add to that business and build that business? And then one final follow-up after that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Steve, right now, our focus really in that business is run the businesses. I mean, at 7-plus percent of margin is obviously generating a fair bit of margin for us. It's generating a lot of cash for us. And those businesses are a great part of our portfolio. As I've said before, it doesn't mean everything will be there forever? No. Does it mean we'll never add to it? No. I mean, I think that's not something that we spend a lot of time right now. Frankly, we're really much more focused on running them. That's how we've got them to where they are. And I think they have become profitable businesses and valuable businesses as a result.", "Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then one final question. What's the strategy on the big slag [ph] of debt that's coming due over the next couple years? I mean, any intention to kind of take care of that in the near-term given obviously, pretty volatile, or the potential for increasingly volatile credit markets out there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, our focus here for this past year really has been to try to be as aggressive as we can at paying down the bank line. So we've been doing that. We have a new line in place with good tenor to it. So we've kind of worked that part of the capital structure and feel pretty good about that. In terms of those future debt payments, I mean, they're of a magnitude and a duration at this point that obviously we feel very comfortable in our ability to pay that down as it comes due.", "Frank Connor", "Steve, when you look at the progress we made on TFC bank loan, we're down now at only $500 million. We expect to pay that off during the remainder of the year. That will essentially take care of all the 2012 maturities and between liquidations and cash flow. When you then look at 2013, we can take care of 2013 with the liquidations and the cash flows from the business during that intervening period of time.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc", "Just a quick question on Foreign Military Sales and things that are going on at Bell. Can you give us a little bit of color as to how things are going to shape up with regard to the V-22 in particular, and where you think that product is going to sell best and what types of things we, as analysts, ought to be looking out for in tracking Foreign Military Sales of some of your helicopter platforms?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So if you talk V-22 firstly, there are a number of customers that have made inquiries and have expressed interest over time in that platform. Historically, Jason, there hasn't been a whole lot done with it because frankly, we don't even have production capacity to handle more than we're doing at the Marine Corps and the Air Force until you're out in kind of that 2015, '16, sort of a time frame anyway. So obviously, those discussions have become more real here over the last 6 months, I would say even or so. I want to be careful because there are some that are not public. One that is public, because I know the Israeli Air Force has talked about is they have expressed an interest. And the Marine Corps actually has hosted them a couple of times. They've flown the aircraft. They've been in the simulators. I think they've been very impressed with the aircraft and its capabilities. So that's one that's sort of in the first stages of putting together a potential FMS program around there. There's a couple other customers who also have inquired who are not quite that far down the path and again, they're not public, so I won't talk about them specifically. But I don't think -- the V-22, we're not talking about hundreds of countries that are going to buy these things. I think it's 10 or 12 countries that are going to buy these things. But the interest is certainly there, in a number of these places. And as I said, the initial ones are starting to actually progress. On the H-1, which is another opportunity obviously and I would say a much broader opportunity, a lot more countries that would look at H-1s both for the utility and the attack version. There are already some LORs that's been submitted to the U.S., expressing interest in these aircraft. So there's activity going on in the formal early stages of working quotations and working the government-to-government side of this thing. So again, early on but also one where we have not had production capacity to serve beyond the Marine Corps requirements. But as we see that requirement and that opportunity coming up in the sort of 2015-plus kind of time frame, we're now working those opportunities.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. And then just one Cessna question, somebody tried to ask this question a bit earlier. And I'm going to maybe do it at a different way. For the second half of this year, how much of your outlook for deliveries is dependent upon what I would describe as turns business or orders that you expect to both get and fulfill during the second half of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, we don't publish what our current number of aircraft orders and sales are. So we usually talk coming into the year, how much sold out in the past. We're trying to get away from that, Jason, because it doesn't help us in the marketplace to say how many available slots we have. But suffice to say, obviously, there are some available slots. But at this point, the color I would give you on that is when we look at what we think our total year deliveries will be, consistent with the guidance that we provided, that we think we have pretty good line of sight of those aircraft sales because they're either a, in the backlog or b, we are in discussions with customers that we believe will close on deals to sell that number of aircraft.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, perfect. And then one last quick question. Can you just describe the focus of the R&D that you're doing there at Cessna? Is it towards the larger aircraft at this point?", "Scott Donnelly", "It really is a mix across the whole product line. So obviously, we have already announced the new X, which is our largest aircraft. We have a number of programs that are going on. And as I kind of said, we will announce at least one of those at the NBAA coming out in October. But the investment is pretty broad across all the various platforms. Some of those are upgrade programs like it is in the X and hopefully, some will be brand-new aircraft. But the one thing I would say is it's not a Columbus class aircraft, okay? I mean, the realm here of what you're doing and where we're investing really runs from our sort of that CJ-sized aircraft right through the X.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Rob Stallard with RBC.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Scott, just a bit of clarification on TFC. You said it's relatively stable here. If we look at the income statement and what the TFC cost is going to be going forward, can we expect it to be, say, maybe gradually trending down from what you booked this quarter going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "In terms of -- I'm sorry, Rob, on cost?", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "If you look on the income statement, what you've got there as your operating cost effectively at the Finance division flowing through the income statement [indiscernible] of this quarter. Would you expect that sort of level of loss to be gradually trending down from here through '11 into 2012?", "Frank Connor", "Rob, let me put it this way. I think kind of we've given the guidance of around $140 million loss for the year. And there'll be variability quarter-to-quarter on that. But kind of that -- that's the number for 2011. That obviously reflects both operating cost of the business, as well as kind of losses on liquidations. We expect, as we've said, that to trend down as the portfolio gets smaller and trend down meaningfully. But we will, we believe, continue to see losses into 2012 and possibly beyond time frame depending on what that portfolio activity looks like.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think, Rob, I mean, from the cost -- that's why I was trying to be careful, I mean, cost has been coming down from an operating cost standpoint, and we'll continue to do that. Obviously, as we reduce the number of assets we have, the cost base to serve those has been coming down with it. I mean, it's probably -- don't necessarily look at it like you would conventional metrics around returning [ph] asset and cost percent asset and things like that. But obviously, it's coming down. And as Frank said, we are going to continue to liquidate this portfolio. And we would expect to continue to see loss as you continue to see that liquidation. So we know we're going to have more liquidations as we go into 2012, and there's going to be loss associated with that. I would certainly expect that the magnitude won't be as great but again, there's some volatility. I mean, if you had an opportunity to sell a good chunk of the portfolio or something, you would take associated loss at that time.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Secondly, on the V-22, you mentioned that you're discussing the multiyear situation with the U.S. government. I was wondering if you're seeing, as this discussion progress, slightly more onerous terms coming through in terms of maybe the price per unit but also just the general risk-sharing contractual terms that the government is actually looking to get from defense contractors.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I would say that the primary discussion point and the primary objective of the government with respect to the multiyear is achieving a certain savings percentage as compared to if they were to procure on a year-over-year basis. So that's really where most of the discussion and most of the strategy, with both ourselves as well as our customer is how to make sure that in terms of unit volumes and times and whatnot, that if we're going to do a multiyear, we're able to figure out a way to achieve the cost ratio. So it's not a price discussion or sharing discussion so much. It's really around how do we get that savings as compared to if they procured on an annualized basis.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "Scott, as you move into the back half of the year, you're really looking at setting the production rates up for 2012 more than anything else. I'm just kind of curious what your attitude is on the risks you're willing to take with respect to not losing share and gaining share versus obviously some conservatism with respect to the balance sheet. And kind of where do you think the backlog needs to be at year end to sustain this level of production you have in 2011?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, first of all, you're absolutely right. We already are looking at what our production rates look like in the next year because the cycle time of these products from supplier procurement all the way through final assembly and test dictates that we started paying attention to that right now. So our view, obviously, we're not in the position yet to try to guide on probably next year. But suffice it to say that we continue to expect to see some modest improvement in the market. And that's how we think about it when we think our production rates. And just as we've done in 2010, and have now done in 2011, we will have to make some estimates in terms of what we expect that demand to look like. And as a result, we'll set those production forecasts. And yes, we will take some risk. But we'll take pretty thoughtful risk, which is the same thing we did in '09 and '10. And those have played out to be about right. So we will take some risk in terms of the balance sheet and some inventory because we know we're not going to have a backlog in 2012, where the aircraft is spoken for. We know the demand is going to be there for the course of the year, and just as we had for the last couple of years, we'll work as good, as hard as we can to try to make sure we're accurate in terms of anticipating what's going on in the marketplace.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "And do you see any movements with respect to the tax accelerated depreciation coming into play at this debt ceiling in terms of how do you -- it would impact orders for this year either pull forward from 2012 into 2011 or otherwise?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don't think so. We have not heard any discussions with respect to bonus depreciation and any different handling than what has been out there. The talk that you hear around changes in -- tax-related changes for business aircraft. As near as we can tell, I mean, all the discussion is around changing the depreciation schedule to a 7-year schedule from a 5-year schedule, but that wouldn't kick in until you go back to the normal depreciation schedule. So in other words, it does not appear that there's any change, none that we are aware of, with respect to the bonus depreciation scheme. So it will just be a going-forward basis that when you go back to normal depreciation it's a 7 versus a 5-year plan. At least that, we believe, is the proposal that's on the table.", "Myles Walton - Deutsche Bank AG", "And last one for me. On systems, would you expect the back half of the year to have a pickup in bookings putting your book-to-bill above one to hopefully support that business revenue level flat into next year at a minimum?", "Scott Donnelly", "At systems, I would expect that. The only caveat I would put around that is one of the things that's been a pressure point for us this year is as we went through all the CRs and all the budget uncertainty. Some of these programs were pushed to the right. Most of those programs or several of those programs are important to us, should close and be decided by the end of the year. And therefore, you would have that in your book. But I mean, given all of the uncertainty and insurance [ph] in Washington, some of that could slide to the right. But the key opportunities that we've been working on should get into the book by the end of the year.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel.", "Stephen Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "On the assumption that you get some foreign military orders, could those be shipped concurrently with deliveries to U.S. customers? Or would they have to wait in line?", "Scott Donnelly", "A lot of that depends on what's going on with the budgets. But I would say that generally speaking, when you get out into the '15, '16 time frame, the Marine Corps in particular, which is our customer on the H-1, and a majority of our customer on the V-22 has been very supportive of these activities. They know it's good for them as well because it keeps higher levels of production in the factories. And I think -- I won't speak for the Marine Corps, but I think they're amenable to feathering in some Foreign Military Sales opportunities, if that will help to capture some opportunities and add some additional volume to the overall program.", "Stephen Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Just going back to Cessna. You've been talking a bit about mix shifting to the larger planes. Is that something you think will be evident in the second half or is that going to be something that's next year and beyond?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think that will be something we'll continue to see in the third and fourth quarter this year as well.", "Frank Connor", "Particularly relative to Mustang volumes as it relates to the mid-light.", "Stephen Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. And just a question about that problem account in TFC, was that golf account or another category?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was a timeshare account.", "Operator", "Next, we go to the line of George Shapiro with Access 342.", "George Shapiro - Citi", "Can you tell us what forfeiture income net of write-downs was at Cessna in the second quarter and how that compares to last year?", "Frank Connor", "It was about $2 million, and it was roughly similar to last year's levels, a little over $2 million.", "George Shapiro - Citi", "Okay. And then, any way to quantify the impact of Japanese order production on Caltex in the second quarter and how it might recover as we go into the subsequent quarters?", "Scott Donnelly", "George, we've tried to do that. I mean, in some respects, it's not that hard because you can look at a particular plant, and we know they went from 5-day to 2-day shifts for a certain period of time. But what they were forecasting versus what they did. There is some murkiness around it. But let's say that globally for us, it might have been somewhere in the order of $15 million or $20 million worth of physical volume. It's not a huge number.", "George Shapiro - Citi", "Okay, it's not a huge number. And then, Scott, if you look at Cessna orders in June in the early part of July versus April and May, did you see any improvement?", "Scott Donnelly", "George, I don't even know if I have that in front of me.", "Frank Connor", "June was strong. Generally, the pace of order activity although there's volatility month-to-month has kind of improved generally as we went through the year.", "Scott Donnelly", "George, the seasonality within a quarter, you always have stronger end of the quarter, just human nature kind of a thing. So I wouldn't necessarily draw anything from that other than unlike last year, the quickest thing come out and have silenced. So we're encouraged by what we saw in June.", "George Shapiro - Citi", "And I was meaning, Doug, obviously, after the normal seasonality, you might expect with the stronger, normally stronger June but you're saying it's hard to separate it out.", "Frank Connor", "It's lack of bad news, as much as anything. So there was no bad news in June, which is good news.", "Scott Donnelly", "You always have some of this lumpiness, George. I tend to look at it on more of a quarter basis. I mean, we see that number every month, but I think of it more on a quarterly basis. And certainly, there's no tonal change. I mean, when I talked to Scott and I talked to Mark and the sales guys, nobody's coming in and saying, \"Oh my gosh.\" Either nothing's happening or all of a sudden everyone wants to buy. I mean, it's been pretty steady.", "George Shapiro - Citi", "Okay. And then next quick one probably for Frank. The sales of the commercial tiltrotor to Agusta [ph], any financial impact from that in this quarter?", "Frank Connor", "No, because it won't close until later in the year.", "George Shapiro - Citi", "And then will there be a financial impact, then?", "Frank Connor", "Well, there will be some impact on an ongoing basis as a result of kind of various elements of the agreement. We will continue to support them and their development on a go-forward basis. And so we will have some engineering activities and support activity and things like that. But there will not be any type of kind of large one-time impact at the time of the close.", "Operator", "That would be the final question, coming from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just quickly on Cessna, one thing we didn't really talk about was how is international demand? What are you seeing there?", "Frank Connor", "Actually, it's been reasonably strong. The Southeast Asia, Indonesia, these areas have been good for us on both Citation jet as well as Caravan [ph] has been good. The eastern European, Latin American markets are still strong. So it's been fairly balanced, I would say, Ron. I mean, it's not one particular region, but I would say the level of interest and the market kind of just sort of modestly recovering, we're seeing on a pretty broad basis.", "Douglas Wilburne", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call. Thank you very much for joining us. And the few folks that were still in the queue for follow-up calls, we'll get to you one on one then.

Wilburne", "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to third quarter results. Revenues in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago, which yielded earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.45 compared to a net loss of $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2010. Last year's result also included $0.30 per share in special charges. Third quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $339 million compared to $174 million during last year's third quarter. This brings our year-to-date cash flow to $455 million, double last year's $226 million for the same period. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying we believe we had a solid quarter, with good execution, especially at Cessna and Bell. We had 15% top line growth in our Manufacturing segments, reflecting sales expansion across most all of our businesses.", "We're pleased with continued success in selling commercial aircraft in what has been an uncertain environment over the past 3 months. As a result, at Cessna, we delivered 47 jets in the quarter, up significantly from last year's 26. With the orders we recorded in the quarter, which is typically a slower order period, along with current customer activity, we remain on track to achieve our target of a slight increase in deliveries this year, barring no major economic disruptions. ", "I'm also pleased with the progress we're making at Cessna with respect to execution. Scott Ernest has been on board for about 5 months now, and I think he and the Cessna team have established a good cadence to drive both operational and sales execution. ", "We're excited about our 2 newest products, the M2 and the Latitude, which we introduced for this year's NBAA. The Citation M2 provides a very economical step up from Mustang with a larger fuselage, an aft lav and a full 12-foot cabin with increased seating. The M2 also features our new clarity cabin technology system, most modern cabin control, communications and connectivity system available on any aircraft in this class. ", "Compared to the competition, the M2 has also a 37% climb seat advantage, will cruise 40 knots faster and provides an additional 100 nautical miles in range. The M2 is also an excellent value priced at $4.2 million and even more so when you consider Cessna's superior aftermarket support and residual value of retention. We're on an accelerated development cycle and expect entry into service in 2013. ", "We also announced the all-new Latitude jet. This is priced between the midsized XLS and Sovereign models. And at $14.9 million, the Latitude is the largest Citation cabin with a spacious 72-foot height and a flat floor system. Combining the best comfort and performance, the Latitude will have a cruise speed of 440 knots and a 2,000-plus nautical mile range, making it a very compelling choice in the price range.", "Moving to Bell. Business execution across our programs continues to be excellent and that\u2019s reflected in our strong margins this quarter. We delivered 9 V-22s, 7 H-1s and 26 commercial helicopters versus 7, 5 and 24 in the third quarter of 2010. Bell backlog at the end of the third quarter was $6.4 billion, down $588 million from the end of the second quarter of 2011, reflecting military deliveries during the quarter, as well as a $781 million reduction to backlog, primarily to correct an error made in the fourth quarter 2009, which recorded as backlog the full value of a V-22 contract rather than Bell's proportionate share. The commercial order environment of Bell is holding up fairly well, given the macro environment, so we also remain on track to post a slight increase in commercial deliveries at Bell this year. ", "On the new product front, our 407GX earned FAA certification during the quarter. The 407GX is generating significant new customer interest and should contribute to continued growth in deliveries at Bell. We're also proud that Bell was ranked #1 in product support for the sixth consecutive year by AIN.", "Moving to systems. We continue to experience some program approval delays, so volumes were essentially flat in the quarter. It's important for us to demonstrate useful economical capabilities that will give traction in what is a very challenging budget environment. For example, we participated in a live demonstration for the U.S. Army of what is known as the Manned/Unmanned System Integration Capability System or MUSIC. MUSIC is a fully integrated ground control station managing a variety of manned and unmanned aircraft systems. AAI's universal ground control stations served as the centerpiece of the exercise, providing command and control of AAI Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems, as well as several other UAS brands. ", "Making UAS history, we seamlessly handed off control of each UAS from one ground control station to another, demonstrating for the first time, revolutionary improvements in battlefield communication and information sharing. We also demonstrated AAI's one system remote video terminal and a cockpit solution that enabled a number of manned helicopters, including Bell Helicopter's Kiowa Warrior, to view and retransmit UAS video and data while in flight. Despite DoD budget uncertainty, we remain focused on new program development, new DoD opportunities and multiple FMS prospects. ", "So if we move to our Finance segment. We continue to make good progress in liquidating our assets, as we reduced managed receivables by $277 million during the quarter. This brings managed receivables portfolio to $3.5 billion with the non-captive portion decreasing to $1.5 billion. ", "In the Industrial businesses, volumes were up in our automotive and professional tool businesses. However, demand continues to be a challenge in the golf and turf areas. ", "To wrap up the quarter. We continue to make progress liquidating our non-cap to Finance business. Systems top line is a little softer than we'd expected, primarily the result of uncertain DoD budgets, and we're actively working on a variety of new contract program opportunities. Bell's execution continues to be very favorable, and our commercial products are doing well in the marketplace. Our outlook for Industrial remains on track for the year. And at Cessna, I believe we're taking the right actions to improve execution and it\u2019s showing up in both our operation and sales results. With that, I'll turn it over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $236 million, up $124 million from the third quarter of 2010. ", "Let's look at how each of the segments contributed to this improvement, starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were up $236 million on a year-over-year basis due to higher jet deliveries. We posted an operating profit of $33 million on the higher volume, which compared to a $31 million operating loss last year. Our improvement in operating profit also reflected favorable mix and performance. At Bell, revenues were up $69 million due to higher aircraft deliveries. Segment profit increased $36 million, reflecting strong program performance.", "At Textron Systems, revenue of $462 million was essentially even with the year ago, reflecting flat volumes. Segment profit was essentially unchanged as well. Industrial revenues increased $55 million, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange and higher volumes. Segment profit remained even with last year. Finance segment revenues were down $27 million, reflecting our ongoing liquidation activities. Our operating loss improvement of $27 million reflected lower loan loss provisions and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower interest margin on the reduced portfolio of finance receivables.", "During the quarter, we unwound 3 leverage leases, creating a tax benefit, which was not reflected in our Finance segment results but was reflected in the lower tax rate during the quarter. In terms of credit performance during the quarter, nonaccrual finance receivables decreased from $696 million to $606 million, and 60-day-plus delinquencies decreased from $302 million to $275 million. Charge-offs in the third quarter were $26 million compared with $38 million in the second quarter of 2011.", "Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $13 million, down from $35 million last year, primarily due to the impact of our lower share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year, primarily the result of lower interest income on the TFC intercompany loan. ", "On the cash flow front, we contributed $16 million into our pension plan during the quarter. We also reduced our TFC bank line by $100 million, ending the quarter with a remaining balance of $400 million, which we will repay later this week. With the repayment, we will permanently terminate the $1.75 billion TFC bank line.", "With our solid manufacturing cash flow and receivables liquidations, we reduced our consolidated net debt by another $500 million, ending the quarter at $3.9 billion.", "Let me conclude with some information concerning our tender offer for our 600 million in convertible notes. Including accrued interest, we paid $348 million to retire about 37 1/2% to the notes outstanding. This was financed from $500 million of new 5- and 10-year notes we issued at the end of September. As a result of the tender, the company will record a charge in the fourth quarter of about $0.08 per share. Dilution from the convert and its associated structure will be reduced by 37 1/2%, and we have updated the dilution worksheet on our website to reflect this change.", "All in, we expect the impact of the tender will reduce 2011 earnings by about $0.06 per share, which compares to our full tender estimate, which was $0.20 per share, a difference of $0.14. Therefore, rounding up, we now expect our full year EPS will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15. We also continue to expect cash flow before pension contributions will be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. ", "That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "First, we'll hear from the line of Peter Skibitski with SunTrust.", "Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "On the Citation delivery, you're about 16 or so through the first 3 quarters of this year, above last year. So you're saying, basically, that for the fourth quarter, you basically pulled some aircraft from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, so you're just kind of still on track, or just up by single digits, I suppose, year-over-year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Peter, as we've been talking about, last year, I think the third quarter was very soft. And that was really a result of the fact that order intake was pretty slow in the second and third quarters, and so we consciously, this year, tried to work hard to sort of bring sales activities to conclusions and get a little more balance between the third and the fourth quarter. And so, I think that's what you\u2019ve seen. So we had pretty strong deliveries, I think, in the third quarter. And we still think, based on that and then sort of the prospects and the level -- stuff in the order book, that we will still finish up slightly above where we are for the total year last year. But really, just with a more balanced third and fourth quarter than we had last year.", "Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Got it. And then last question just on Cessna, margins are, obviously, significantly improved, even just looking sequentially. And I'm wondering if you can parse for us kind of where the improvement is coming from, and if it's volume, if it's mix. I know Mustang was a little bit light this quarter or if it\u2019s just more so -- just underlying performance improvements. Could you kind of parse that for us?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. I mean, it's a combination of all the above. So, obviously, volumes being stronger with good contribution margin products certainly helps. We did continue to have, as we have for most of the year, better mix in terms of the light to midsized versus the Mustangs in terms of unit deliveries. And we're continuing to see better execution, better performance, particularly cost activities around the CJ4 and things of that nature. So it's really been a combination of the volume and the mix. And I think we're continuing to execute better and drive cost productivity in some of the programs that were kind of putting a little bit of a squeeze on our margins.", "Peter J. Skibitski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "Right. Is CJ4 up to kind of the mean margin rate at -- in the Citation line at this point, or not quite there yet?", "Scott Donnelly", "Not quite there yet, but it's certainly on track to get there.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Scott, you highlighted that Cessna orders are typically a little softer in the third quarter than the average for the year, but they are down noticeably sequentially. And we're getting pretty close to the end of the year with about 70% of a given year's \u2013 or of the current year's production in backlog. How can 2012 be flat to slightly up with that being the case?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, no. I think, first of all, there's a couple of dynamics going on. There still continues to be some cancellations, and these are primarily out-year aircraft, right? So deliveries out in the '13, '14 time frame, some '12, really, very little '11. But this is just -- and people come do -- for some of those long-term orders, we are still seeing some cancellations. I actually feel pretty good about where we finished in terms of actual order intake over the third quarter. It's usually is kind of a slower period, but our order intake rate stayed pretty constant from where we are in the second quarter, despite the fact that it's usually a fairly quiet period. We feel like we have pretty good prospect lists. We have started taking orders, obviously, into 2012 in terms of aircraft that are available for sale in the early 2012 time frame. So I think, Noah, the bottom line is this is going to remain a bit of a spot market, right? I mean, we are taking orders and converting them into sales inside the span of a quarter or 2. And I think that trend is probably going to continue. If you looked at the introductions of things like the M2 and the Latitude, which are getting great reviews from customers, and they are generating some orders, but we're not back in the world where people lined up to place orders for aircraft that are 2, 3, 4 years away. It's still going to be a spot market for a while. So I know the book-to-bill number, because -- particularly, because some of the cancellation activity doesn't look as strong as you guys have liked in the quarter. But I feel actually, we did better in the order rate than I would have expected that we would have through the third quarter, given everything going on around the world and the economies. I think the team is working very, very hard to chase down opportunities and close deals, and we're seeing that happen.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So, I mean, whether you're looking at book-to-bill or not, there is less than one year of production in the backlog. So inherent in the company's comments that '12 will be flattish is an expectation that orders will pick up pretty meaningfully early or in the middle of 2012. At what time or at what backlog level or whatever it is would you need to change that tone or make the call to take rates lower?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it would all be based on what we see in terms of our prospect list and the order -- and the sort of the real-time order flow. No, we're really not building to a backlog, and we haven't really been for the last couple of years, right? I mean, most of the deliveries are results of order flows coming through the course of the year. So at this point, we're not changing our perspective on it being sort of flattish to slightly up from 2011, and that's based on what we see in terms of the prospect list. So it really -- that decision, in terms of where rates go one way or the other is much more of a -- sort of a dynamic call, as we work our way through month by month, working with the sales teams, looking at prospect lists, what's going on in the marketplace, is really what's driving that production rate. But like I said, right now, I'm actually feeling pretty good about it, considering all the stuff that's going on around the world that the third quarter order rates and prospect lists have stayed pretty solid.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one on Bell. Surprised to see only two 429 units in the quarter. You guys are clearly tracking below the full year target that you had put out for that product. Can you give us an update on demand there, the ramp execution and profitability on that program?", "Scott Donnelly", "The demand, I think, will still be there. There's a lot of stuff going on in the marketplace right now. There's a lot of proposals out. So I think that there's still a lot of great opportunity for that. We certainly will see a significant increase here in the fourth quarter in terms of 429 deliveries. And as you know, that at the point where that product is in its life cycle here is still early in production, does put some margin pressure on it. And that will be an issue for us in the fourth quarter, because we will see a significant uptick in the number of 429 deliveries.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Do you actually get close to the 55 to 60 that you've discussed before?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I don't think it'll be that high, no. It's probably going to be more like in the 30-or-so area.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So not to beat a dead horse, but on your orders, you mentioned cancellations. Were gross orders equal to deliveries?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, they were not.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then were there any kind of abnormal items, like were -- comment on the level of forfeiture gains or pretax losses. And was R&D up or down versus the second quarter? Any kind of other issues like that, that would account for this?", "Scott Donnelly", "R&D was up a little bit in the quarter, Cai. And the net difference between stuff like the forfeiture deposits and used aircraft write-downs and whatnot is really kind of down now in the mid-single digit number. So it's not -- it's becoming sort of not material.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. When you say up, up versus the second quarter? Obviously up year-over-year but comparable to the second quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "On the R&D front?", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, I believe it was, but just modestly.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And then, the degree of success, the 37 1/2% you've got on the tender offer, I think really was less than we expected. Any sense as to why it was not more successful? And what's your strategy going forward to kind of deal with that issue?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Cai, I mean, obviously, our intent in doing the tender was that we felt that given the equity levels and given the availability of what is still relatively low-cost term debt that it was the right move for the company to sort of trade out some of that what could be higher-cost convertible debt for normal term debt. And so that was the whole purpose, obviously, of doing the tender. There's no question that the expectations going into it that we were hopeful that we would get a number considerably larger than 37 1/2%. But in terms of why it didn't happen, I think the bottom line is a lot of investors out there said, \"You know what, we like this instrument. We're getting a 4 1/2% coupon, and we've got an option on the stock.\" And where we are today versus expectations and where it could be in 2013 is sort of a bullish statement. So we'd like to remove that piece from our capital structure, but if you got an investor that thinks that's a good piece of paper, it's hard to get them to tender.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And the last one. You did particularly well margin-wise at Bell. Were there any EAC catch-ups or anything like that, that would be considered abnormal or was it just great performance?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it was just great performance. I mean, there is some EAC in there, but nothing materially different than sort of a normal quarter flow of comparable quarters EAC. So these guys are just doing a very nice job at converting on the higher volumes, managing costs. And obviously, that's translating into positive numbers for the business. And frankly, on the military side, it's been positive for our customers, because they're sharing in that benefit.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Scott, I think you\u2019ve spoken before about your expectations for the Cessna -- for Cessna book-to-bill to be above one before the end of the year. Is that still the case? You expect the book-to-bill to be above one in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "David, I always dream of getting back to book-to-bill of greater than one. I don't know if the fourth quarter's going to be it or not. I would be kind of surprised. I mean, obviously, we're going to have -- we still think we're going to have pretty strong deliveries in the fourth quarter. And so I think what we see is enough order flow to continue to make that happen for the fourth quarter and the kind of order flow that we expect to need as we continue to roll and to support the 2012 delivery rates. But I don't think that number's going get up above a 1:1.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Looking at your updated earnings guidance, it looks like if I adjust for the charge on the convert, it looks like you're implying the fourth quarter\u2019s somewhere between $0.28 and $0.38. Is my math right? And if so, what are the kind of puts and takes as to why the fourth quarter will be lower than the third quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, you're right. You've got $0.08 or so in there that's going to be a result of the charges on the conversion -- I'm sorry, on the convert tender. I think we're going to see some higher costs associated just down at the corporate expense level. We probably will have a little bit higher loss on the Finance business, as a result of a couple of deals that we think are going to close here in the quarter and some of the restructuring. So I think the manufacturing level, we'll probably see a little bit better performance in terms of [indiscernible] in the quarter, but that's going to be offset by sort of the Finance loss to convert tender and some higher corporate expense.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Last question. Any initial thoughts on pension in 2012, both from an expense standpoint and then from a contribution standpoint?", "Scott Donnelly", "I'll let Frank take the pension.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. So no, we're still working through the numbers. Obviously, with interest rates where they are, there's the potential for a discount rate change versus where we had previously been, but we don't work through all those items until the fourth quarter. Obviously, our 10-K gives the sensitivities around some of those changes, which again, for a discount rate change would be $25 million for 50 basis point change. So we may see some headwinds associated with assumptions. We may see some favorability associated with some actuarial work we're doing around -- kind of continue to do around our workforce and kind of the assumptions that are made on that side of things. So we do think -- overall, we expect to see some level of headwind, but we've got a lot of work to do before we have any ability to provide you with better guidance on it.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Two quick questions. What needs to happen in the fourth quarter at Cessna in order for you to get to the top end of your guidance range for the year? And then, the second question is if you could just walk us through the Industrial businesses and kind of talk about the outlooks for each of them for the fourth quarter and kind of what the trend line has been, particularly in automotive.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So obviously, Cessna, for us to finish at the top end needs to come through and meet the guidance that we've been giving you guys, which is deliveries for the total year 2011, up slightly from what we had in 2010. In terms of execution, I think the team is pretty well positioned to make that happen. There are still some sales that have to close for that to happen. So it's not, by any stretch, a done deal, but I think the prospect lists and the work the sales teams are doing around the world are going to, if not get there entirely, get pretty close to it. So it's -- I think, achievable at this point, but there is still work to be done there.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'm sorry, the question was a little bit more directed on the margin rate for Cessna for the year.", "Scott Donnelly", "On the margin rate?", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, the margin rate is largely going to follow that volume coming through.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So it's volume is the most important part?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. I mean, we'll continue, as I said, to make the improvements in terms some of the cost positions and particularly in a couple of models like the CJ4, getting our profitability back up. But I think we're pretty well on track in that regard. So at this point, it's a matter of making sure we convert on a number of aircraft deliveries.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then on the Industrial side?", "Scott Donnelly", "On the Industrial side, I would say that particularly around the automotive business, the volumes continue to grow. Frankly, the margin rate in the auto side was probably a little lighter than I would like to see it. And that's primarily driven by -- the good news is there's a number of new platforms that were launched in the quarter, which gives us good volume going forward. There's also been a number of OEM moves around the world, where we also then have to move some of our capacity around the world to be there with them. And it wasn't a disaster, but there were a couple of operational misses in there that resulted in some of the volume coming through without the margin rates that we're accustomed to seeing in that business. Those are short-term issues, so I think as we get those production lines stabilized and those new platforms stabilized that we'll see the margin rates come with it. So at least, at this point, I think if you look at what the CSM data's telling you and the industry is that they're expecting at the OEM level, continued growth. I think we're very well positioned on a number of those new platforms. And so we will see that growth come through and come through with the kind of margins that we expect to see going forward. So bottom line, a little bit of softness in the quarter, but that was really just getting the execution on a couple of new ramp-ups going, and I think we'll be all right long term.", "Operator", "Next Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, you mentioned about the general level of uncertainty that's out there in the broader economic world at the moment. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how this had impacted your activity, maybe over this quarter. You mentioned how Cessna orders have held up pretty well. But has this had any impact on your ability to convert maybe at TFC? Are you seeing order rates in Industrial slowing down? Or if you\u2019ve got any other broader comments, that would be helpful.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, environmentally, we haven't really seen any deviation from what we expected to see, let's say, at TFC. So the liquidations continue to be of the magnitude that we expected. I would say that across our portfolio, whether it's TFC or the Industrial businesses, the golf markets around the world continue to be pretty soft, particularly the U.S. And so, we are continuing to see liquidation for instance in the golf portfolio, but not big numbers. And we continue to see a softness in the golf-related industrial products. So that's one industry that I would say, environmentally, is still pretty challenged. If you looked at Cessna, as I said, I think if you look at the amount of uncertainty around the economy today versus where we were a year ago, a year ago, when you had these kinds of issues, particular with respect to sovereign debt, it really had a major impact on what was going on with our customers and the order flow. This year, it has not had a significant impact. So we continue to see order flow despite a lot of those uncertainties. Western Europe would certainly be the one that has been the most challenged, I think, in terms of order activity. But the U.S., actually, has been kind of continuing at its pace. The Latin Americas and the Asia regions also seem to have a fairly strong level of customer activity that's going on. So I'd say, environmentally, the only real challenge I see across the portfolio is really in the golf and turf area. Most of it, other than that, has continued to flow. The Tool business, actually, is doing fairly well. As I said, the automotive business continues to be fairly strong. And most pieces of the portfolio don't seem to have been hit too hard. Obviously, in the defense side, from an environment standpoint, there's a lot of budget uncertainty out there. There's a lot of programs that are being delayed. The amount of time it takes to evaluate a contract \u2013 to issue a contract. We see a lot of slowdown in that area, and that's why you see sort of the flat top line in the systems business. And I would say, at this point in time, given all the uncertainties in Washington around the DoD budgets that we'll see that continue to be an issue here for some time.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And a couple of quick follow-ups on that. You mentioned that there's differences within the order flow at Cessna by region. I was just wondering where your overseas orders maybe ended the quarter. Because I know it's been over 50% at some point. So I wonder if that's still the trend. And then on the defense side as well, what sort of level of delay are we seeing in orders being awarded? Is it like 2 to 3 months more than you normally expect?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think a lot of -- on the defense side, you really have to think almost in terms of quarter. So programs that we would have thought at the beginning of the year would be awarded in the third or fourth quarter this year are now out in the first and second quarter of next year.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So regional splits, sorry?", "Scott Donnelly", "The regional splits, orders are very lumpy. But I mean, if we talked about deliveries, I mean, we're, obviously, particular with Europe in a little bit different place from where we were before, but it's really been more like a 70%-30% in terms of domestic versus international. And that can wander back maybe closer to 60-40 kind of range, but it's -- I think it's going to be in that range for a little while.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague", "I\u2019d just like to dig into Bell a little bit more. The margins really do look extraordinary. And I guess if there is nothing unusual going on there, I\u2019d just like to kind of understand better the components of the strength and how should we think about it going forward. You seem to imply in your Q4 remarks that overall manufacturing not dissimilar to Q3. I don't know if that applies to Bell specifically. But can you give us some sense how you get to 16%? We've got a couple of quarters in a row where Bell margins have been better, and the talk has been maybe they can't stay this high, and they seem to kind of keep going up.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we had pretty favorable mix in the third quarter. Obviously, the military stuff continues to go along. We had some good commercial deliveries. As I think you know, Jeff, there's a fair bit of variation in each of these model types in terms of profitability. The aftermarket, obviously, is good, profitable part of the business. So I think if you look from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, the knot [ph] will be up, at Bell but also, obviously, on higher revenues. And I would say that I think the team's performance continues to be strong across all the platforms, but we will have more 429s. And that does put some pressure on the margins, but there's nothing unusual going on. I think the team is just doing an excellent job of executing on the increased volumes. And I think that is a trend that will continue.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague", "Can you give us a sense then, just on a normalized basis, if you look out at your V-22 and your H-1 ramp, and you\u2019ve got kind of a view on commercial, kind of a range of what you would say is the normalized margin of Bell?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I don't think we'll talk about that just yet, Jeff. I mean, we'll, obviously, give you guys 2012 guidance and try to put some balance around that at that time, but we'll give you that in January.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague", "And then, I guess -- I mean, Frank, you were asked on the pension question, and I understand you\u2019ll snap a line on 12/31. But do you have a sense just kind of where things stand today, kind of at least put us in the ballpark of what we might expect next year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Jeff, as I said, there's so many moving pieces to it. Obviously, the markets have been bouncing all over the place in terms of asset returns. We are doing the work, as I said, on the actuarial side, which we do on a regular basis, but we've got kind of an experienced set now in a more stabilized workforce environment that we are looking at. And so there's probably kind of a bit more of a positive impact there than when we've looked at this previously. And we just don't know kind of what those assumptions on discount rate and return might look like. I mean, you'll recall, as we sat here this time last year, we had a very low interest rate environment, and therefore, there was all kinds of concerns about what those assumptions were going to be. And then, at the year end, it was quite different. So obviously, we're in an environment where we expect rates to stay low and, therefore, some discount rate pressure reflected on the expenses, but there'll probably -- there'll be some offset to that. So there are numbers out there that you guys have around headwind that seem as kind of as reasonable a range as I could give you right now, kind of to think about, because there's just too many moving pieces to it.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of George Shapiro with Access 3:42.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "I just wanted to pursue Cessna a little bit more. I mean, on a sequential basis, the incremental margins were closer to 50%. And the question I've got is how much of that was really due to what's clearly a favorable mix versus how much Scott Ernest is able to implement already?", "Scott Donnelly", "Let's just run our numbers, George. I think it was marked in the mid-20s in terms of the sequentials, which is kind of what we would expect with the mix of aircraft, particularly with a stronger mix of the light mids versus the Mustangs. So as I said earlier, I think the -- that kind of leverage, given that kind of mix on the volume is appropriate. We have had some models where we've been at a lower level of profitably than we would like to do. And I think Scott and the whole team out there are continuing to be very, very focused at getting those models in-line, and we've seen progress steadily as we've gone through the year. So I think that the team is doing a nice job. I think they'll continue to do that, and they have, obviously, challenges in front of them to make that -- to drive that cost as we continue into the fourth quarter and obviously for 2012. And I think, just as importantly, the real drive and focus around the rhythm of sales, and putting more feet on the street and being a lot more aggressive about getting out there and capturing business. I mean, we're certainly seeing the benefits of that. But I think, the bottom line, George, is that leverage from sequential quarter-to-quarter is probably more in the mid-20s.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "All right. I'll check my numbers then. I thought it was that way year-over-year but more sequentially.", "Frank T. Connor", "Year-over-year it will be much larger, George, but sequentially, it was the low-20s.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. That's probably right, George. Probably have it the other way. The year-over-year where you had a lot of issues on...", "Frank T. Connor", "We went from a loss to making money so it's really kind of...", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "I may have said it backwards.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. So the year-over-year is a little distorted just because of the nature of where we were and losing money, but the sequentials, you should see to be in the mid-20s.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "Okay. And then just, Scott, sequentially, orders were actually down from the second quarter. I mean, was that kind of expected given the normally weak July and August? Or was that something that was -- because I was expecting it to be sequentially a little bit better.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, yes, I think that the order rate was actually fairly strong and pretty consistent with where we were in the second quarter, but we did have some out-year cancellations that influenced the backlog number, which is probably what's skewing the number for you, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "Okay. Okay. So if I took out the cancellations, it would have been closer to what you saw on a gross basis in the second quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "First, I want to follow up on George's question about the mid-20s incremental margins you saw in 3Q. Given the volume you expect to see into 4Q, any reason to think those incremental margins won't stay there? Any puts and takes on mix or R&D?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, let's just say, we still have work to do.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. I mean, is there any mix or R&D issues? Or is it more this quarter, you had kind of great operating results, and you don't want to count on them until you see them persistently?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look, I think we had very strong operating results. I think we have a lot of work to do to keep that going. We have a little bit of mix going on. As I say, I don't want to necessarily get into guiding quarter by quarter on margin rates here, but to try to sustain that level of leverage, we still have some work to do in the fourth quarter.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then, Frank, I guess, a clarification on the pension side, I just wanted to understand your comment about demographics and the plan. Are you actually looking to maybe shift the amortization of gains and losses over the remaining life of the employees versus the service life? I mean, are we at that level of change to the assumptions, similar to what Goodrich or Rockwell Collins did last year?", "Frank T. Connor", "No, what I was referring to is kind of has nothing to do with the accounting treatment of it. It has to do with just continuing to look at the profile of our employees in terms of when they're retiring, kind of the amount of attrition we have at various stage groups and continuing to update kind of how that experience set impacts all of the actuarial assumptions that go into all the pension calculations.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then on Bell, lastly, back to the questions about outperforming your own expectations on a pretty consistent basis. When is the next repricing that you'd have to worry about? Is it not until the multiyear expiration in '13, '14 that would be a kind of material repricing event? Or is there anything near-term that could put downward pressure on some of your more established programs?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, there's a sharing that goes on in the existing V-22 contract, and so that will always put some downward pressure on it, because there's a share line. And then of course, on things like the H-1, there's an annual negotiation around that pricing.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I guess I'm not going to get more out of the long-term expectations for Bell margins then.", "Scott Donnelly", "Not at this time.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just had a question really on the Bell commercial orders outlook, someone like Eurocopter as recently as September was saying the U.S., for them, in terms of the commercial order sort of tempo in customer conversations was trending sort of pretty well. I just wondered what your thoughts were on the commercial orders outlook in Bell.", "Scott Donnelly", "I feel pretty great about where Bell commercial is right now. I think our order intake rate has been good. We've been seeing wins from customers that we haven't done a lot of business with in many years. So I think, as you know, we really started almost 2 years ago, really trying to reestablish ourselves and put a lot of additional resource and focus into the commercial side of Bell Helicopter and that sales force, and we feel great about where that's going.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the Industrial business, you've seen a number of sort of the automotive OEMs, the production outlook seems to be deteriorating, particularly in Europe. You said, obviously, near term, you\u2019ve got a boost from new platforms. You\u2019ve also been doing some reorganization globally. I just wondered if there was any effort in the auto piece of Industrial to do some kind of more fundamental cost takeout just on the assumption that production volumes may deteriorate even though, obviously, you get some tailwind from platforms being launched.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we certainly look, as we go through our annual operating plans, we look at every platform we're on. We understand from the OEMs' perspective what those lines are going to look like. And obviously, we understand what can happen if you have a general slowdown in one region or more than one region for that matter in the automotive sector. So our ability to take out cost and size those operations appropriately for even what would be a significant downturn in volume is something that we're all too familiar with. So in the event that, that really plays out, we certainly have the playbook, if you will, on how to address that. But right now, at least the feedback we're getting from the OEMs on all of our platforms is still indicating that there'll be pretty stable steady growth. But absolutely, if that changes, we know what we need to do to take cost out of that business and continue to operate through a down cycle.", "Frank T. Connor", "And Julian, as a point of history, for this past year, I think that we've been hearing a concern about slower volumes through the year, and that just has not materialized. Every quarter, the total outlook for the year has pretty much remained consistent with our original outlook for our business.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure. So the sort of the migration of capacity that you mentioned earlier, that's more to do with as you say, just lining up better with the OEM customers. It's not to do with some kind of general volume slowdown concern.", "Scott Donnelly", "No, that's right. I mean, particularly, Julian, I mean, you see more growth in China. I mean that's becoming a -- obviously, it already is the biggest automotive market in the world. And as you see more and more of our customers increasing their capacity and production rates, we go there with them, right? I mean, we need to locate and have our production capabilities, more or less, adjacent to them. So we continue to see that trend. But we're seeing really relatively stable volumes, even in a lot of our Western European operations. So it's something that everybody worries about. And if you read the headlines, you\u2019d think, \u201cGeez, automotive is going to collapse,\u201d and obviously, we watch it very, very closely, but it has not happened this year. It's been staying on track.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Mayur Manmohansingh - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is Mayur, in for Carter. I just had a question on systems. Scott, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the potential risk that you see to systems next year as part of the whole budgetary debate?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think as I said earlier, I believe we're going to continue to see a slow pace of new programs and contract awards. It's not that nothing's happening. I mean, they did just come out with the -- and awarded the ASB reset program, which we won. There are quite a number of programs that we have proposals in. And it's just the pace at which new program requirements come out, the speed at which RFPs are ultimately released and evaluations are done, I think there's just a general slowdown. And as I said earlier, I don't think that's going to change as we go through 2012 with all the uncertainties around their budgets. So as we look at most of our programs and significant contract opportunities, we think it won't be unusual to see those things slide to the right, 3 to 6 months. It's not that new programs aren't going to happen or that contract awards aren't going to happen, but the guys in the building that do all this sorts of work are really sort of overloaded at this point with all of these different budgetary exercises and the amount of time they're having to spend modeling and thinking about what different configurations or what program opportunities, timing, there's a lot of different sort of churn, if you will, within the building that these guys are having to do to respond and react to all the different potential budget outcomes. And that's, frankly, a lot of work. It's on top of what they would normally be doing. And so I think that's resulting in a general delay of a lot of programs. So I think, obviously, we don't want to get into 2012 guidance at this point, but that is going to pressure the top line at the systems business. And I think it, obviously, is having an impact on what our expectations would have been this year to where we're down below a couple billion of revenue, and I think it's going to continue to pressure that top line in 2012.", "Mayur Manmohansingh - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just as a quick follow-up. On the -- you have a $0.10 variance in the Q4 estimate. I wonder if you can just clarify what is behind that variance? What are the main drivers?", "Frank T. Connor", "I'm not sure what you mean by variance.", "Scott Donnelly", "It's the $1.05 to $1.15. Are you talking about the spread? I think the bulk of it is really going to be -- where do we end up on Cessna deliveries, will drive the bulk of that swing. As I say, we still do have some aircraft to sell, and there's work going on to make that happen. But there's still some variability in terms of, obviously, in the business jet market today, what that total number of deliveries will be. So in my mind, and when I look at sort of what's the variable in the quarter, that's probably the most significant. That is the most significant.", "Frank T. Connor", "And I think it all ties around the macroeconomic environment. I mean, with the volatility that we've been dealing with, you just really be unwise not to have that kind of a view on potential outcomes.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "Drew Pierson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Drew, in for Steve this morning. I just wanted to follow up on the 4Q guidance. I mean, the EPS range on a headline basis is basically unchanged, except for the adjustment to the below-the-line items. But at the segment level, just to understand what is changed versus the last quarter. It feels like Cessna and Industrial are probably about the same, Bell a little bit better, Systems may be a little bit weaker. Is that the kind of the right way to think about it? And then walk us through kind of what's changed in the outlook.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, as you know, Drew, we don't really do quarter-to-quarter kind of guidance per se. But the numbers, the way I would see the quarter playing out is I think we'll see a little bit stronger outperformance out of the Manufacturing businesses, particularly Bell and Cessna. But when you do a quarter-over-quarter comparison, you're going to see the pressures of the cost of the convert flowing through there. I think you'll see some higher corporate expense. You'll see a little bit higher loss quarter-over-quarter in the Financial Service business. And that's really where you end up on the quarter.", "Drew Pierson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Sure. But I mean your Manufacturing free cash guide hasn't changed. So fundamentally, there hasn't been a change, looking at the way you look at the year now versus at the end of the last quarter?", "Frank T. Connor", "That's right.", "Scott Donnelly", "No, there really hasn't been. I mean, as I said, we're still believe \u2013 granted towards the top of the range, but that we'll see the number of Cessna deliveries we expected, and we'll see the number of Bell deliveries that we expected. So there, really -- from an operational perspective, we don't really see a change in terms of what our expectations were for the fourth quarter.", "Drew Pierson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, did you guys give a cash conversion number at TFC?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was about 80% in the quarter.", "Operator", "In a moment, we'll hear from the line of Noah Poponak. [Operator Instructions] Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of clarifications. If I understood your comments correctly, it's dynamic and a moving target, and you're not giving '12 guidance. But with what you see now, you would expect the Industrial top line more likely to be up in '12 versus '11, despite Europe auto production probably being down, and the Systems top line in '12 with what you see now a good chance of being down in '12 versus '11. Is that a correct interpretation?", "Scott Donnelly", "With you, I don't even need to give guidance. Perfect.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have no more calls in queue. Thank you for joining us today, and we'll see you in January.", "Operator", "Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. We will now like to turn the conference over to our host, Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Thank you, Terry, and good morning, everyone.  Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to fourth quarter results, starting with Slide 3. Revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, up 4.1% from a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a loss from continuing operations of $0.06 per share, which compares to earnings per share of $0.20 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Last year's EPS included $0.13 in special charges. Because we're reporting a loss in the quarter, the per-share loss is based on a basic share count of 279 million shares.", "Looking at Slide 4. This year's result included a number of onetime items, which resulted in a $0.55 reduction to fourth quarter EPS. Before we go through each of the items, let me point out that the amounts on this schedule are based on fully diluted shares, specifically 292.5 million shares for the fourth quarter and 307.3 million shares for the full year. ", "So starting with the first item. We recorded a $186 million pretax mark-to-market charge in the Golf Mortgage portfolio and our Finance segment in the quarter. We also recorded a $55 million pretax loss in corporate expenses reflecting the impact of convertible note purchases we completed during the quarter. As you may recall, we received $225 million in face value of notes in response to our public tender offer. Subsequent to the tender, we purchased another $159 million of notes. So on a full year basis, the total after tax impact of the convertible purchases was $0.13 per share, $0.08 of which related to the tender notes, and was included in our most recent full year guidance. ", "We also recorded $60 million in pretax charges at Textron Systems. This included a $41 million charge for intangible impairments and an approximate $19 million charge for severance costs. Working in the opposite direction was $59 million in pretax income, resulting from a payment of a note receivable from the company's 2008 sale of its Fluid & Power business. $52 million of this amount was recorded as an offset to corporate expense, and $7 million was recorded as an offset to interest expense.", "So after adjusting for these items, our fourth quarter earnings were $0.49 per share with full year at $1.31.", "Moving to cash flow. Fourth quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $545 million, bringing our full year amount to $1 billion. Full year pension contributions were $642 million. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning everybody. Capped off the year with a solid fourth quarter with Cessna segment profit up $37 million; Bell up $29 million; and Industrial, up $24 million. We all saw a continued progress with another $386 million in liquidations at Textron Financial. That brings our full year liquidation to $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we also moved the remaining Golf Mortgage portfolio into the held-for-sale category. As a result of the mark, we are now projecting the Finance segment will be approximately breakeven for the year. ", "Looking at Slide 5, our non-captive portfolio is now below the $1 billion mark at $950 million, with about $380 million in Golf Mortgage and about $320 million in timeshare. For the smaller portfolio, our annual liquidations will also be smaller, so we're anticipating about $350 million in non-captive receivable liquidations in 2012.", "Moving to systems. Revenues were down slightly in the quarter, consistent with what we've been seeing through the entire year, as a result of DoD program delays and project cancellations. Looking at 2012, with continued DoD spending pressures, we're expecting a relatively flat top line for the year. ", "As a result, we're executing a rightsizing plan at Systems, which is reflected in the severance charge we recorded in the fourth quarter. We're taking these actions to improve our cost competitiveness in a tighter budget environment. We'll continue to invest in new products, DoD opportunities and prospects for foreign military sales. ", "In the meantime, we have a number of important program proposals, which should be decided this year and should clarify the growth outlook for Systems. In terms of 2012, we anticipate flat revenues and margins in the 10% range.", "Shifting to Industrial. We continue to see good volume expansion in the quarter with Greenlee and Kautex, with Golf volumes relatively flat. We saw margin improvement at the segment with fourth quarter margins at 6.9%, versus 3.9% last year and 5.6% in third quarter. ", "Looking at 2012, given the unfavorable prevailing foreign exchange rates and uncertainty in European markets, we have a conservative top line expectation for the Industrial segment, resulting in flattish revenues and margins.", "Moving to Cessna. We delivered 67 jets in the quarter, down from last year's 79, reflecting our success this year in balancing deliveries between the third and the fourth quarters. In total, we delivered 183 jets, up from 179 in 2010. The big driver of this growth was the excellent receptivity in the marketplace for our CJ4, as we delivered 48 in 2011 versus 19 last year. ", "Order activity for the CJ4 remains good in large part due to the fact that the aircraft's performance is exceeding our expectations, as is usually the case with our Citation products. ", "With respect to the overall order environment, despite continued economic uncertainty, the fourth quarter was our strongest order quarter of the year. As we enter 2012, we continue to be in a spot market, but believe the market demand should build throughout the year. Coupled with our enhanced sales and marketing capabilities, we believe 2012 deliveries will be up modestly. We also expect margin improvement with increased volumes, despite planned increases in R&D spending as we continue to improve cost productivity.", "Longer term, we expect jet growth will accelerate as the global economy stabilizes, emerging markets develop further and our new products roll into the marketplace. In fact, customer reaction to our 2 most recent entrants, the M2 and the Latitude has been very good, and initial deliveries of those models should contribute to growth as they continue to come to the market in 2013 and '15, respectively.", "Now to wrap up with Bell. Execution across our programs continues to be outstanding, and that was reflected in our strong margins in the quarter. We delivered 7 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 62 commercial helicopters in the quarter, versus 7 V-22s, 7 H-1s, and 71 commercial units in the last year's fourth quarter. ", "On the military side, we continue to have excellent execution and delivery commitments, cost productivity and quality. Looking forward, we're actively pursuing FMS opportunities for both H-1 and V-22. In fact, we had an enthusiastic reception by a number of potential FMS customers at the recent Dubai Air Show. We took a number of them on demo flights so they could experience the impressive capabilities of V-22 technology firsthand.", "After a flight in an actual V-22, there's no question in the customers' mind with respect to how valuable this asset would be in the armed services. On the commercial side of the business, we're seeing the benefit of investments we've been making in product development and sales capabilities with very strong order flow.", "Most recently, our 429 helicopter was selected by the Turkish National Police for their fleet, with a requirement of 15 to 20 aircraft. The 429 also received an additional 500 pounds of lift certification from Transport Canada, increasing its gross weight to 7,500 pounds, which meaningfully increases the value of the aircraft for our customers. Looking to 2012, based on our current commercial backlog and customer activity underway, we expect a significant increase in commercial deliveries from the 125 aircraft delivered in 2011.", "Along with program increases in our military platforms, we expect Bell revenues to grow nearly 20% with strong margins. ", "In summary, I think we had a good year despite continued volatility in a tough global economic environment. Textron Systems is clearly affected by the DoD budget challenges, but we are taking actions to improve our competitiveness in this new environment. And Industrial, last year's top line -- 10% top line growth reflected growth in auto volume and our continued investment in new products. Cessna showed good progress, improving cost productivity throughout the year, revamped the sales process and launched 2 exciting new products. Bell performance at an all-time record, and just as importantly, we announced new products with more to come. ", "Overall, we substantially strengthened our balance sheet as we liquidated another major portion of our non-captive portfolio and generated strong manufacturing cash flow, allowing us to reduce our consolidated net debt by $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion. ", "Looking forward, we believe our overall growth outlook is good, as we continue to pursue a strategy of rapid new product development. Looking to 2012, on a projected overall revenue increase of about 11%, our guidance for EPS from continuing operations is in the $1.80 to $2 range. Cash flow from manufacturing operations before pension contributions is expected to be $700 million to $750 million, with pension contributions of about $200 million. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $268 million, up $27 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "Let's look at how each of the manufacturing segments contributed, starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were up $51 million on a year-over-year basis, as lower jet deliveries were more than offset asset by higher volumes in propeller products and aftermarket. We posted an operating profit of $60 million, an improvement of $37 million from the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting better cost performance. At Bell, revenues were up $35 million, segment profit increased $29 million, reflecting strong program performance. At Systems, revenues were down $14 million. Segment profit decreased $63 million, reflecting the previously mentioned charges and lower revenue.", "Industrial revenues increased $70 million, primarily due to higher overall volume. Segment profits increased $24 million reflecting improved performance and a higher volume.", "Finance segment revenues were down $15 million as a result of our ongoing liquidation activities. The Finance segment loss increased $175 million primarily due to the mark-to-market charge.", "Looking at Slide 8 in terms of credit performance, before taking into account the impact of the reclassification of the Golf Mortgage portfolio, non-accrual finance receivables decreased from $606 million in the third quarter to $566 million. And 60-day-plus delinquencies decreased from $275 million to $241 million. However, when receivables are transferred to held for sale, they are removed from these credit performance metrics. Therefore, non-accruals ended the year at $321 million and 60-day delinquencies were $166 million. ", "Taking a look at Slide 9, our Finance segment capital structure reflects a 5.9x leverage ratio, well below our long-term target of 7x and consistent with our plan to achieve our liquidation strategy without the need for any new permanent capital.", "Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $39 million, down from $48 million last year, primarily due to the impact that our lower share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was down $10 million from a year ago, primarily as a result of the $7 million in interest income associated with the collection on the Fluid & Power asset sale.", "Turning to pensions and looking at Slide 10. We are reducing our discount rate and long-term rate of return assumptions, and we're estimating that 2012 pension costs will be approximately flat. We would've had an increase in pension expense given the discount rate and long-term rate of return revisions. However, the impact of changes in plan participant behavior and workforce demographics, and last year's cash contributions to the pension plans, offset these headwinds.", "Turning to Slide 11. We are planning to increase R&D spending for 2012 by $110 million to about $590 million or 4.8% of sales. This includes program-focused efforts in our businesses, as well as some product development activity at corporate. We also plan to invest slightly more in CapEx this year, about $450 million compared to $423 million last year. These investments are consistent with our emphasis on new product development and improving cost productivity.", "Now flipping to Slide 12, here's a summary of 2012 segment guidance. We're expecting about 14% revenue growth at Cessna and 19% at Bell, with a flattish top line outlook for Systems and Industrial. At Finance, as Scott indicated earlier, we're expecting non-captive receivable liquidations of about $350 million. with segment profit approximately breakeven for the year.", "Looking at Slide 13. We're projecting about $145 million for corporate expense, which reflects the impact of a higher share price and the cost for the previously mentioned product development activity. Interest expense at $140 million is flat with last year, and we're expecting an increase in our tax rate to about 32%, primarily reflecting the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we're assuming an average share count of about 294 million shares. ", "With respect to our EPS guidance, to give you a sense of the underlying improvement in our business, take a look at Slide 14, which is a walk from our 2011 GAAP results of $0.79 at the midpoint of our 2012 guidance range. $0.52 of the improvement relates to the elimination of the fourth quarter onetime items and $0.37 reflects the elimination of Finance segment operating losses. There's a pick-up of $0.09 primarily due to lower convertible share dilution. We have a tax rate headwind of about $0.04, primarily related to the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit, and $0.31 in headwinds from higher R&D and depreciation. This means that we expect our underlying manufacturing business to generate approximately $0.48 increase in earnings per share. ", "I'd like to wrap up with a final comment about our liquidity outlook. With the financing actions we took last year and the liquidation success we have had with TFC, we have made significant progress from a capital structure and financing point of view. Looking at the next 2 years, we have $200 million of debt coming due in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2013, which we believe can be satisfied even under a reasonable downside scenario with our current cash balance of nearly $900 million and expected cash flows at TFC in the manufacturing businesses.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, Terry, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Scott, the book-to-bill at Cessna, when you calculate just straight up on sales, looks like it was about 0.7. But when you look just at the jet side, x Mustang, was that number closer to 1? Because I know the sales number includes a fair amount of service revenues, used aircraft revenues.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "David, I haven't done the math that way to look at that. I mean, I'm sure it's a more favorable number, but I think what's more important at this stage of the game where Cessna is and where the light to medium-sized business jet recovery is, is this is all about selling aircraft. So for sure, there's some backlog there, but we're out -- as we look at our numbers and what we're guiding you to in terms of revenue in the business. This is all about selling airplanes and that's where we've been sort of for the last 2 years. So where we're guiding, where we think the revenue is going to go, where the jet volume is going to go, as we kind of say up modestly is really more based on our view of the current marketplace, the level of customer activity and what we think we'll be able to close in terms of orders, which largely we'll be converting to sales, just as they have been in the last couple of years. So my principal view is see us up modestly is based on sort of the tone of the marketplace and what's going on with the sales guys. And I'd love if we had this big backlog and could tell you, \"Loo, it's all locked up,\" but that's not where we've been for the last 2 years. And we've been pretty accurate about gauging the market and getting the orders in, converting into sales and I think that's where we're going to be in 2012.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Scott, a question on Cessna's pre-R&D margins. Can you give us a sense as to where you were in 2011 and '12, considering that R&D is going up this year? How shall we think about it in a pre-R&D basis?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think on a pre-R&D basis, we are seeing some margin expansion. This past year, I think, we've even seen that through the course of the year as we attacked particularly the cost issues around the CJ4, and have gotten that where it's now back to reasonably healthy margins. So I think if you look at sort of the contribution margin level, we'll continue to see improvements in that through the course of the year. We're assuming relatively flat on the pricing side. So I think the improvements you're going to see are going to largely -- because obviously, there's some benefit and some additional volume. We obviously have the headwind of the R&D, but I do think just the underlying contribution margin will continue to improve.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question, Scott, on the -- you talked about the tone of the market. I wondered if you might speak to what you're hearing, seeing from the sales guys on a geographic level, U.S. versus Europe versus emerging markets and what sort of things, particularly, you're seeing in the U.S. with there being such a large market and having presumably some sort of pent-up replacement demand. Is that an area of strength? Or any color there would be helpful.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, it certainly is, Carter. I mean, I think if you looked at the sort of, geographic lay of the land, our deliveries over the course of this year have largely been U.S. It's probably around the 70-30 split U.S., versus international at this point. That seems to be the trend. I would expect to see numbers pretty consistent with that 70-30 split as we go through 2012. So the U.S. as you say, very large installed base. Customers are used to upgrading, certain amount of pent-up demand, where people know it's getting to be time to do this. And I think that's what's driving a fair bit of the activity. The Latin America markets continue to be pretty strong. We still see some strength in some of the Indonesia, Southeast Asia regions that are creating some demand, particularly strong for some of our Caravan turboprop lines, some activity in Eastern Europe. Western Europe I would say is pretty quiet at this point. So again, I think, in total it's been sort of a 70-30 market. And I would expect to see that trend through 2012.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us an update on the V-22 program? I guess at one point, you all sounded fairly confident about a second multi-year, then that's ebbed towards maybe that not happening, and now that discussion seems to be picking back up. Can you tell us what you expect to learn in this Pentagon deliberations over the next few weeks on V-22? And if you could walk through the next several year kind of unit outlook you see there, that would be very helpful.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure. So I think, Noah, the conversations between ourselves and the Marine Corps and the acquisition side have stayed pretty constant with respect to V-22 and the outlook for another multi-year. We've submitted proposals. Those proposals have been going through the analytical process in the Pentagon in terms of justification around a multi-year versus a series of single-year contracts. That's usually a fairly long elaborate process, and it's proving to be exactly that. But I think that there's general views, both on from our perspective and the government's perspective, that a multi-year is the right answer for the program. So I would say I remain pretty bullish that, that's going to happen. It's certainly our desire. I believe it's our customers' desire to make that happen. So I think what you'll see happen now is -- the original basis was on sort of original program of record volume expectations. I think everyone has known for some time now that the reality would be that the rate of production, when you get out to 2015 and on, will be at a lower per annum number. And so we're in the process now of working through with the government and revising the numbers to reflect lower rates of production. But that process is continuing, and I'm still, again, fairly bullish that we will end up with another multi-year. And that process will work its way out here probably through 2012. I think again, we want to see that happen. The customer would like to see that happen. We all know it's the best economic outcome for the customer. So that being said, I do believe that the rates on V-22, which are still ramping as we go into 2012 and then they kind of hold steady through '13 and '14, my expectation is that the U.S. government side of this thing will be lower in 2015 and on. And that's why we're outworking FMS opportunities, looking at other applications of the product. There are a number of international customers that are very interested. And the way we have to look at it is that, sure, numbers will be down on the U.S. DoD side in '15, but that actually creates some production capacity to go address the Foreign Military side. So that's the process that we've undertaken. We're out selling, were interacting with a number of customers to try to fill what will be that production gap when you get out to the 2015 timeframe.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It sounds like you think this is up next year, flat '13, '14 and then potentially still flat depending on what you do internationally even beyond that.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. The contracted numbers, Noah, are 39 in '12, 40 in '13, and 36 in '14. So up, then flatten, slightly down '13, '14.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "But you're right now, this is, we're basically running at peak capacity for the next 3 years, and then we have production slots to fill for 2015.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then on the Bell margin, can you speak to -- they've been very good and above expectations, can you speak to the degree to which you're theoretically over earning on V-22? Especially potentially V-22 aftermarket? Or if this has just been straight up performance or some mix of the 2?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think it's been straight up performance. I think our margins have been good on V-22. I think one of the things you're seeing a big swing is our historical margins on H-1 were very poor. And as we've gotten H-1 and the real production rates and running and driving productivity and efficiency into that, we're getting the VH-1 rates to where they should be. So I think V-22 and H-1 are fair rates as we've overachieved in terms of driving costs. We've been able to get some better margin and our customers have been able to get benefit out of that as well. So I think those programs are in good shape. They're healthy both in terms of original equipment and aftermarket. You don't see huge swings in the pricing on those original versus aftermarket on the military side. We continue to see reasonable volumes on our commercial business starting to build, the service business doing okay. The big difference is as we go into 2012 is you're going to see, again, some increase in V-22 as we talked about going up to the 39, but we expect to see pretty significant increases in original equipment commercial sale. And obviously, we're putting a lot of money into the R&D side of this thing, and we have a big announcement here at Heli-Expo, and we're ramping up pretty significant program investment. But all that being said, I think our margins will stay strong. I mean the guidance we're putting out there I think is a pretty solid guidance for a helicopter business. These are good margins and we'll sustain them.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mitchell, Julian with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess the first question would be around how you think about the cost base of the company? Because I guess you've got a situation where the backlog's still shrinking in Cessna, but the deliveries are looking better. So how are you thinking about capacity and kind of utilization rates given where capacity is today versus the prior peak? And then also, I guess how capacity relates to the defense side of the business where there is some restructuring going on, but you're optimistic on the V-22, you have a new multi-year program. So how are you thinking about managing that cost base down over the next few years? And what are you thinking about the cost base inside Cessna as well?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure. So I mean, Julian, obviously it varies a lot from business-to-business. So I look at Cessna, where we've done a lot of cost reduction over the last couple of years, which you would expect given the significant volume reductions that we had. I think we've probably now turned the corner on that. We had a slight increase this year. I think we'll have a modest increase next year in terms of the production volumes. Obviously, the number of new product programs is increasing. So we're sort of at a point now where we would expect to be growing our -- some cost associated primarily with R&D at Cessna. We obviously don't need to invest anything in growing raw capacity at Cessna. Now we do have some additional CapEx. But again, that's all driven around tooling for these new product programs. So in terms of the physical infrastructure, manufacturing facilities, metal bonds, paint boost, that stuff is all in place and ready to go. So there's no increased capital in that area, but I don't think we need to do any more rationalization of that cost or facility because we're actually now going to probably start to turn to higher levels of utilization. At Cessna -- I'm sorry, at Bell, the situation, in fact, we had a note that was out a couple of weeks ago. One of the things that we're looking at is our capacity as we start to see the levels flat or even decrease in terms of things like V-22s out in 2015. Historically, we've done most of our commercial aircraft final assembly in our facilities in Canada, and we've done primarily our military V-22 and H-1 final assemblies in Amarillo. So we announced that this new program, the product which will be announced here at the Heli-Expo shortly. We've already announced that the production, the final assembly of that product will be in Amarillo even though it's a commercial ship. And the reason for that is we already see capacity expansion or capacity being pretty tight up in our Canadian facilities. But we know we can have some softness on the military side, so we're going to put that production capacity in Amarillo to help balance our utilization of what was wholly dedicated to military to put some commercial volume in there as that commercial volume grows. If you look across the Systems business, part of what we announced yesterday in terms of our restructuring is exactly aimed at an expectation that you will see some lower volumes and lower demand across those businesses. And obviously, if we end up winning some programs and you see some growth, then we'll address that. But I think it's prudent in an environment where you know the budgets are going be tighter and things are going to tend to be delayed and scaled down, that we're taking the appropriate charges and size in the cost structure of the business. So that even if it's a smaller business, it's a profitable business.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, I was wondering if you can comment on the order situation at Cessna, it tends to be in the past that the fourth quarter has been a strong quarter for business jet sales, and then things have maybe dried up a bit in the subsequent quarter. Do you see a similar sort of pattern this time around?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, Rob. I think the nature of this thing, the way it works with tax incentives and whatnot is we've always had the cyclical nature of the fourth quarter being a strong delivery quarter, and the first quarter tends to be a fairly weak delivery quarter. And I think that you're going to see that. I think that's fairly natural in the way these industry cycles work. That being said, given the strength of what we see on the order rate through the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter, I certainly expect that we'll have better performance in the first quarter than we had a year ago. So in terms of profitability, it will probably be more in the breakeven. But I think the good news is, we won't be digging ourselves a big hole in the first quarter as we have the last couple of years.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to follow up on the Textron Systems, you said you expect the revenues this year, 2012, to be roughly flat. What sort of backlog do you currently have there? Because given the pressures you have in the DoD, that would seem like a relatively optimistic forecast.", "Frank T. Connor", "Well, the backlog was $1.3 billion Rob, it was down just a little under $200 million from the third quarter. But again right now, backlog is a difficult metric for Systems because of the undefinitized contracts and the like there.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes I think -- exactly. The backlog, first of all, Rob, as you know, I mean you have to kind of look at the different pieces of the business to try to kind of understand backlog. And there is an awful lot, too much, in my opinion, of undefinitized contract work going on where you can have an entire contract executed under an undefinitized contract, which means it never goes into backlog, because it's not a definitized contract. So that's a metric that I would be cautious about. I think if you look at the 3 largest businesses in there, ASVs are pretty well spoken for in terms of volume in 2012. When you start thinking about 2013 and '14, it's largely going to be around what happens with programs like the Canadian TAPV program, so again, I don't think that was backlog per se. I think 2012 feels good and again based on contract awards, we'll see how things are going into the future in the defense systems, Sensor Fuzed Weapon business. That's a business that I feel pretty comfortable where we are in terms of customers and backlog and order rates, that, that's probably going to sustain for a number of years at kind of the rates that we're running today. And then the UAV business is probably going to be in reasonable shape for the year. It's a number of different contracts, a number of different programs, mostly upgrades, there's some ISR Services programs, there's SMSF opportunities. There are programs that have to be won but in terms of where the budgets are in the government, where our backlog is, what programs we're executing on, I think, it again aims towards being a relatively flat year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Access 3:42.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "Scott, just in Textron Systems, I mean how realistic do you think it is to have flat revenues there as opposed to down to some extent?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, George, again, I think that for 2012 we have pretty good insight into the ASV business, which is a good size part of the business that's already -- program that we're executing and we'll deliver through the course of the year at the SFW side of things, and we know what that is. Those contracts were already won, we're already executing the programs. There are some things that need to be won on the unmanned air vehicle, unmanned air system side of the business, but there are several opportunities. So I think we have reasonable visibility on the year. I mean, depending on what happens in the budgets, we can always have some additional haircuts. But I don't think they'll be dramatic, and that's why we kind of guided to flattish. I mean it could be down a little bit but also it could be up a little bit. I think it will depend largely on how those program win opportunities go through 2012. And obviously, I think even more important, that will give us a lot better insight into what '13 and '14 look like.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "And then one in Bell. I mean, the past 2 years, you kind of blown away your Bell margin guidance by a lot. Why wouldn't you still do a lot better this year since I'm figuring you're at the tail end of the current V-22 multi-year, and usually you wind up getting some contract pick-ups in that last year of the contract.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean I think there's a couple of things here, George. I mean we are forecasting 13% to 14%, which are pretty healthy margins. We do have R&D headwind as we ramp up a significant program in that business. With respect to these end-of-contract kind of things, we have been, I think, much more diligent at working very hard to make sure that our estimates of completion on these program accounting areas are much more, I don't know, I won't say realistic, but I mean, we're trying to make sure that we're doing a better job of forecasting the total program margin and try to avoid having these big end of contract, onetime sort of cum catch accounting things. So I think that the margins that we're booking associated with our revenue are pretty accurate to what the real margin of the programs are. And to take out some of the conservatism perhaps that others put in there and then end up with these big gains at the end of contract period.", "George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC", "Okay. And then one just quick one on Cessna. I mean given that you're more relying on the spot market, I mean, how do you factor in the margin guidance that you're giving? It would seem like you probably got to be somewhat on the conservative side.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I don't know George. I mean this is kind of year 3 of this. So trying to understand where the market is, what customer event [ph] is going to look like, what's going on competitively in the marketplace, it really is -- it's a forecast. But again, we've gotten to be fairly good at this. I mean, there's always the disclaimer if jeez things really went -- changed radically in terms of the marketplace, then we could see some additional pressures. But we've aligned our production forecast to where we think it's going to go. As I said earlier, I think we've seen sort of a flattening of price for the most part of the markets. So we kind of assume that's going to happen. And then obviously, we look at what activities we have internally around cost productivity to support that level of margin rates. So I think just our view is given where the market is, the level of activity on the order rate, the discussions with the customers, what we're doing inside, what we're doing on R&D, we feel like this is a, hopefully, a fairly accurate projection of where we're going to be.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So your R&D, you projected is up 50 bps for the year. Is it fair to assume that all of the businesses, except for Systems, you're going to see some increase of about 50 bps?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes. I think that's fair, Cai, though I think the majority of it, you'll see around Cessna and Bell.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right, right. But those are the biggest absolute numbers. But so as we think forward beyond 2012, is R&D at Cessna now likely at sort of a plateau level or near a plateau level?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think you could still see some increases in the absolute dollars, Cai, but I think given where we think we're going with revenue, you're going to start to see that flat line in terms of on a percent of sales basis.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Okay. And could you give us a little more color? You have a number of competitions in the Systems area. Could you give us a little more color in terms of what those are, when the decisions are and your chances?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So well, I like our chances, Cai. The most significant programs that are out there, you've got the Ship-to-Shore connector, which will probably be, I think it will be a first half decision. I don't know if it will be in this quarter, but it will probably be in the first half of the year. You've got the TAPV program, which is the armored security vehicle, light air platform in the Systems business, which is probably going to be likewise. I don't think it will be first quarter, but more likely in the second quarter. We have several programs in Sensor Fuzed Weapons, which I feel very good about in terms of winning in places like the UAE and Saudi Arabia. We also have some programs on the Unmanned Air Vehicle side and medium UAS and ISR Services that are programs which, again, are probably in the first quarter, second quarter this year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Terrific. And lastly, your Golf area that's held for sale, are you in negotiations? I mean, is there a reasonable chance that, that could be gone within the first 6 months?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, and no. I think it's not -- Cai, the reason we put it into held for sale is, as you know, our strategy on virtually all of our assets has been to just hold for investment, run them in due course and in the event somebody's  solicited to acquire and look at them, we would do that and move them to sale at that time. And that's obviously been very effective in all of our other asset classes. Because there's not a lot of liquidity going back into the Golf Mortgage portfolio area, we felt that a change of strategy to say we'll hold them for sale so because now we can go out and more actively market those and try to look for opportunities to do that. So we've obviously just made that change in strategy and obviously, taking the accounting that reflects that. So now we're in a position where we can go out and start to market those assets. I don't think it's going to be one big transaction. I don't think it's going to happen within 6 months, but I think it gives us the ability to go out there and get a better feel. Look, I mean, it's not our objective here to fire-sale these things or feel like we need to do something in 6 months. Our cash position is great. But it's just not an asset class that is turning or one where we're getting a lot of inbound traffic. So I think it's appropriate that we change the strategy, put them up for -- it's held for sale and then go start to make inquiries and see what we can do. So I mean, I still think this is probably more like a 2-year time horizon kind of a deal but at least we can get out there and start to market them.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Scott, can you speak or maybe, Frank, just speak to the cash flow outlook for 2012. Obviously, downticking from '11, it looks like D&A and CapEx kind of offset, is there anything else in particular that's going on in there that drives the year-over-year delta?", "Frank T. Connor", "No. We kind of overdrove a bit on cash flow frankly in 2011, Jeff, kind of relative to obviously what our guidance had been, that the cash flow guidance for '12 is essentially 100% conversion on earnings. And so it's right in the area that we think is a normalized type rate with frankly some better performance in 2011, causing a bit of the kind of the negative comparability.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And I was also just wondering kind of last question for me, just, Scott, thinking about the cadence here in '12 with Cessna, you succeeded in '11 and relatively getting at level, although it always ramps towards year end of course, but do you see the same type of cadence in '12? Or given that the backlogs are a little leaner going into the year relative to kind of the forecast that maybe it tilts more back-end loaded again?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think I would expect it to look more like we saw in '11. So as I said earlier, Jeff, I think we're -- clearly our expectations in terms of at cadence in what we're doing out there in selling, combined with where customers want to go is that I would expect we'll get off to a better start this year than we have over the last couple of years. And we'll sustain at that better more level pace through the balance of the year. So we don't want to see this big -- frankly, it's very difficult to run the business effectively with these huge swings. So the focus of the business clearly is to make this thing more level. We were successful doing that between Q3 and Q4, and I think we'll be much more level this year. I want to be cautious. I mean the third, fourth quarter always going to be stronger than the first, second quarter. I mean the first quarter is a challenge. But again, I don't think we will dig as big a hole in the first quarter, and we will have something that's more like what you saw in the third and fourth quarter last year in terms of trying to level this thing out.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Scott, you talked by the business becoming more a spot business and obviously, you've done a good job in the last couple of years managing it to that extent. Can you give us maybe a little bit more granularity of the 183 jets you delivered in 2011, how many of those were actually bookings in year that were spot bookings?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I don't even have that number in front of me.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you give us any ballpark?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I mean, honestly, I'd be guessing. When you go through and you look at -- obviously, there's a lot of dynamics, cancellation to orders and whatnot that are in there. So no, I'm sorry, I would be completely guessing. I just don't have the number.", "Frank T. Connor", "Also, I think the best thing to say is that we've gone into our delivery years with less backlog than in normal circumstances. And we were clearly in that situation now, and I think Scott went through a pretty extensive discussion in terms of those dynamics.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes. I guess was curious, though, if you had $1 billion burn in the backlog this year, was that largely because of cancellations? Or because of deliveries from backlog? Obviously, they would tell you 2 different things.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It was both.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I guess a clarification on the $180 million outlook for pension expense in 2012, Frank, how much of benefit did you get from the change in demographics, and I guess, choices by the employee base?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. It was kind of $50-ish million, $60-ish million of benefit from kind of the various changes that have taken place in terms of kind of our employee profile and kind of attrition rates and things like that as we relooked at the employee base and the trends over the past couple of years. So it was a meaningful number and obviously, the kind that very much helps on a go forward cost basis.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "And then the cash contribution was...", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. And then the cash contribution.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from line of Jason Gursky with Citibank.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Scott, you mentioned the Ship-to-Shore competition that might happen in the first half of this year. Can you just remind us, if you are successful on that, what your expectations are around revenue levels and timing?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's not going to have a huge revenue impact in 2012. That program starts out as a development activity, completing the design, and then you go into a limited rate production, that's probably '13, '14 kind of timeframe. And then you'd really see production volumes out beyond that. So an important program obviously, but one that's not going to be a big 2012 revenue impact.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right, okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned several things during the call that pricing at Cessna at this point you expect it to be kind of flattish. In your experience, what are you going to take for pricing power to come back to the industry generally, I mean we're at pretty low levels of capacity utilization? Where do you think we need to get, kind of industry-wide, to see pricing actually firm up and maybe actually starts higher?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think there's 2 things. I mean obviously, just some demand in the marketplace never hurts. I think the other thing is more new products and more differentiation. So as we look at new products coming into the marketplace, things like Latitude where you have some significant differentiation and capability, M2 where you've got differentiation in product and some other new things that we have in the pipeline, there's no question that refreshes, updates and just flat out having a better product always helps a little bit on the price line as well. So I think it's that combination -- that's why I kind of see things flattish here over the next year because demand is just starting to come back, and the current product suite, which are great products, but there's not a lot of new stuff to say, \"Hey, you're going to pay more than you would have paid 6 months ago because of some new capability.\" So I think you'll see some slight lift on price in the sort of the near to medium term just as demand comes back, and then you'll see better pricing, you should start to see more and more product differentiation.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then one last one, just on the Systems side. Do you have any ability to participate in the JLTV or what is it going to be -- your exposure going be there, if you're going to go that route as opposed to Humvee recap, and just kind of any other types of opportunities that you might see out there that you haven't already discussed either today or in the past several quarters?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So we don't currently participate in the JLTV program. We are one of the candidates to the extent they would look at a Humvee recapitalization program. There's a lot of noise going on right now in the building around that program, like a lot of programs, as to whether it will happen, won't happen, whether there's JLTV and some Humvee recap activity. There's been some very recent word out of Pentagon that they may not do the Humvee recap program, but this is all sort of new, news and obviously something that we'll need to understand and work our way through.", "Operator", "And we have a question from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a question, I know you're not going to give us kind of your backlog status for the year. And I guess you said that it's going to finish or at least start relatively similar to prior years, but maybe a little bit better given the indications you're seeing. At what point, if we assume that things don't play out in the consensus macro way and we do get further hiccups in Europe, et cetera, at what point will you make a production decision on 2013? I mean, is another production cut in your mind, maybe is there any probability of another production cut given what you're seeing for 2013? I'm just thinking about how kind of short cycle this business is now, and relative to the economy, and it just doesn't appear to me that the backlog situation to change very much coming out of the fourth quarter.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Steve, I think normally just the way the cycle of the business works, the '13 decisions is really more in midyear '12 in terms of production rates, I mean, something we revisit and look all the time. I mean we're not -- just the nature of the long cycle manufacturing, it's not something we're -- we look at it like on specific dates. I mean, it's something that's kind of always a roll forward. In terms of the probability that you would see a production back off in '13. I mean as you said, if you had a major hiccup another 2008, 2009, from a global economic meltdown happen, absolutely, you would have a reduction, and we would act accordingly. I think that seems fairly unlikely given where we are right now and certainly unlikely given what that level of activity we're seeing with our customers, but something we always keep an eye out for. But the timeline here for '13 is something we would be looking at as we go into really more closer to the midyear for next year, when we'll start making that decision.", "C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Sure. So I guess it doesn't sound to me like -- it sounds to me like the, I guess, the inquiries and customer conversations that you're having are at least enough to kind of make you feel good that you could grow or at least hold your production stable even in a kind of, now I guess we can call it a 2010 or 2011 economic environment, where it's a little bit more confidence based than actual dramatic declines in industrial production and that type of thing. Is that the right way to kind of think about it?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes. I think that's accurate. I mean, if you kind of stay where we are, then we would feel like we can make our 2012 numbers that we're forecasting to you, and then that would kind of hold steady through '13.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of questions for Scott, maybe on the defense side of the business first. You mentioned before about things potentially slowing down in the DoD and some things getting pushed out. Can you give a little more color around how you're trying to reposition the business given that changing backdrop?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean a lot of it is just around the cost structure of the business. I mean, we went through a period of growth through '06, '07, '08, '09. And as you sit here and you say, okay guys, things are going to be slower, we're seeing a fairly regular trend towards decisions being delayed, program starts being delayed, we need to size the business of cost structures, so a lot of the reductions we're doing. We're not taking big hits out of a lot of the areas that we think we need to invest to win new programs in the R&D and the bid proposal areas. Obviously, manufacturing-related costs, we will scale and have been scaling associated with the volume of those productions. But when it comes to a lot of the overhead functions, support and things like that, we really need to size that thing back to being a smaller business and if you win contracts, you get new opportunities, that's fine. You can add cost back in to execute them but I think it's just taking a general trend that, sure, we want to grow, yes, we have a lot of proposals out there. And if we win, most of them, we could see growth. But we have to, I think, have a mentality that says this whole industry, under the current payout trajectory of the DoD budgets, is an industry that's going to shrink. And so we want to try to get -- make sure we're ahead of that.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then maybe just switching gears a little bit to the commercial side of the business, maybe more specifically Cessna, when you think about the bifurcated recovery in the business jet market right now, I mean a lot of the really big stuff's kind of comeback already, the mids and the lights, it seems like they're starting to come back. Isn't that really tempting to do a bigger airplane to try to get into that piece of the market?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean I think there's 2 things there, Ron. First of all, you're right. I mean, just the nature of how the cycle has played out, the big metal has come back faster than the light to mid, but the decision to go get into doing -- the big cabins where this stuff is really strong, is a much bigger aircraft. It would be a huge investment on our part to go do that, which I think we would have to do with the expense of investing in the core of our light to mid-size market. And it's not like the large market isn't pretty well served. So I mean, you're basically spending a ton of money and to go into a well-served market, I just don't think it will be the right use of our capital. The place where we've been very successful and we can make a lot of investment and be very competitive and be in the right position as the light, midsize growth comes back is just a better bet for us.", "Operator", "Now we have a question from Steve Levenson with Stifel.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I think all the good questions were asked. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape for Cessna as things begin to look up, what you see coming into the market, and what you see that might be going out of the market?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So I think from a competitive landscape, obviously, what you have new coming into the market, which is now been going on for a few years is Embraer. We've seen them come in with the Phenom 100 and 300. The announcements and introductions that will come in the future on the 450 and the 500. Clearly, when you look at some of the things that we've announced, the M2, which really puts a product out there, the issue we really had is a Phenom 100 kind of sat bigger than a Mustang but smaller than our CJ family. And so by coming in with the M2, we're providing an aircraft in that cabin class with better speed and performance was something that I think will be very, very good for us in the marketplace. Similarly, if you looked at where things were going on something like a 450, which was sort of bigger than our XLS, a little bigger cabin comfort in there, which has been our strong suit in the past. That's the reason the Latitude exists. It gives our customers, again, a product in that category, with those kind of performance features that's a better product. So I think that from a new product standpoint, and this kind of refers back with the discussion with Ron, investing in those kind of products, like the M2, like the Latitude and you're going to hear more things to come, really is positioning us with some outstanding products vis-\u00e0-vis what the competitors are doing. In terms of guys going out of the market, there's obviously a great deal of uncertainty around where Hawker Beech is going, and we'll all hopefully kind of see how that plays. But I think -- we look at the competitive market that's out there today, both the current guys, the new guys that have come in, and I think that our product strategy is in a great spot right now in terms of making sure that we have very, very competitive products that line up very well head-to-head with the overall competitive marketplace.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "All right, Terry, I think we have one more follow-up question in queue and we'll finish up with that.", "Operator", "Okay. And our follow-up question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of follow ups. Given what you've done with TFC and the shape of the balance sheet and the cash flow statement are now in and the cash flow projection you just gave us, which looks fairly strong, when do you think about bringing back share repurchase and/or a larger dividend?", "Frank T. Connor", "I think we've got another year here of being focused on continuing to work on the balance sheet, continuing to kind of fund the pension plan. We, obviously, with the moves that we made on the convert this past year, we did retire some underlying dilution associated with that securities and so kind of we did pay a premium for those securities to, in fact, remove kind of the dilutive impact of that. But we're going be largely focused as we look at, at least this year, and continue to kind of watch how the businesses continue to ramp, with continuing to improve the balance sheet and work on the pension plan.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And just one other one, just one other one on the Cessna margins. I know there's a lot of moving pieces, and the volume outlook is relatively uncertain. But the midpoint of the revenue and the midpoint of the margin imply a year-over-year incremental that is a little bit below 20%, and that's comparing against a 2011 that had a huge negative number in the first quarter that I suspect you're not intending to repeat. And you have new leaders at Cessna that at NBAA went through a dozen slides on all the things they're doing on a productivity and cost standpoint. So it seemed like that would be low relative to those items. Is there more upside or downside risk to Cessna margins from where you see it today?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "That's a different, difficult -- yes, I have to say that the answer to that question is yes. Look, I think if the volumes come through, there could be a little bit of upside to it. If there's volume softness, then there could be some downside to it. And I think that's kind of why we got it where it is. No, it's a phase in this program or for that business given where the market is, that we're uncertain on volumes, right. I mean there's a lot of aircraft to sell. We're out doing that. We're having pretty good success with that, I would say. But we're going to be selling airplanes all year to make those numbers happen. So when you balance all that stuff out, that's why we ended up where we ended up.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to first quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, up 15.2% from a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we recorded income from continuing operations of $0.41 per share, which compares to earnings per share of $0.10 in the first quarter of 2011. ", "Moving to cash flow, first quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $106 million use of cash. First quarter pension contributions were $144 million.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. I believe our first quarter financial results represented a very solid start to the year, reflecting growth in our commercial aircraft and industrial end markets and continued operational execution improvements across all of our businesses. We also secured a number of key program wins and made some important strategic moves in the quarter that should help provide growth in the long term.", "Starting with systems, we won 2 important unmanned aerial systems fee-for-service contracts from the U.S. DoD. The business model for these fee-for-service programs is different, and we normally -- in that we will be investing CapEx in the platforms upfront and in turn, we'll be receiving cash over time as we operate the assets to deliver services to our customer. These 2 contracts were important for a number of reasons. First, the addition of what we expect will be meaningful revenue streams over the next several years at Textron Systems. And second, both these awards are based on our Aerosonde unmanned aircraft, which is a smaller air vehicle than our traditional Shadow models. So we'll now have a second product platform deployed with the U.S. military, which should lead to future opportunities. Finally, these contracts provide an opportunity to demonstrate the attractiveness of fee-for-service UAS arrangements for additional U.S. and foreign military applications.", "Moving over to our Finance segment, we continue to have success with our non-captive exit strategy as we liquidated $171 million in non-captive finance receivables during the quarter, including $67 million reduction in our Golf portfolio. This included the disposal of 13 golf course mortgages and one owned golf course at favorable prices. Our non-captive portfolio now stands at $780 million. We generated income in the quarter, which reflected profitability in both captive and non-captive portfolios.", "Shifting to Industrial. Operating performance was solid, with revenues up at each of the business units. We did see some softness in European auto and tool markets as expected, but this was more than offset by strength in North America.", "Moving now to Cessna. We delivered 38 jets in the quarter, up from 31 last year and saw a double-digit growth in our aftermarket business. More importantly, we continue to see improvement in customer activity. New orders were higher than last year's first, second and third quarters combined; and our customer prospect list continues to improve. We had several additional positive developments at Cessna in the quarter, including an improvement in the range specification of the new Citation Latitude from 2,000 nautical miles to 2,300 nautical miles, the first flight of the new Ten, the first flight of the M2, delivery of our 400th Mustang and the announcement of new service capabilities in China.", "Expanding our Chinese service capability is part of our accelerated China strategy for which we also announced a very important agreement with AVIC to develop a Chinese general aviation business. We expect that this agreement will lead to a number of business opportunities. We expect to form a JV with AVIC and the Chengdu municipal government, which will focus initially on final assembly and completions of our Sovereign product line for our Chinese customers and will ultimately evolve to include a number of activities, ultimately including the development of a new aircraft. We're obviously very excited about this opportunity and believe this positions Cessna very well to participate in what will be a significant growth market.", "To wrap up with Bell, we delivered 10 V-22s, 7 H-1s and 30 commercial helicopters in the first quarter versus 9 V-22s, 4 H-1s and 15 commercial units in last year's first quarter. Solid execution on the ramp up in these deliveries allowed us to post another quarter of excellent financial performance. The commercial demand environment of Bell continues to strengthen and based on order activity underway, we still expect to see a significant increase in deliveries this year. ", "During the quarter, we also expanded the addressable market of Bell with an important product announcement at Heli-Expo, the 525 Relentless. This new 16-passenger super-medium helicopter will offer best-in-class capabilities, including superior payload, range, cabin, and cargo volumes. The 525 will have a fully integrated glass cockpit featuring the Garmin 5000, integrated avionics suite, a pair of GE CT7 engines and a BAE fly-by-wire flight control system. The Relentless will be especially well suited for deep water offshore applications in oil and gas and will also serve as a great platform for search and rescue, emergency medical services, and VIP and corporate missions. The 525 is a strategic new product for Bell, which we will expect will meaningfully contribute for future commercial growth.", "To wrap up the quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs in our commercial aircraft markets at both Bell and Cessna. We posted strong results at Bell and Industrial and much improved results at Cessna. ", "At systems, we had 2 important program wins in a challenging defense environment. Overall, I think we're focused on continuing to prove our tactical execution, at the same time, we're also investing in making strategic moves to grow our business over the long term. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.  Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $247 million, up $80 million from the first quarter of 2011 on a $342 million or a 13.9% increase in manufacturing revenues.", "Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. ", "At Cessna, revenues were up $113 million on a year-over-year basis as a result of a $23 million -- or a 23% increase in jet unit deliveries and an 18% increase in aftermarket revenues. We narrowed our operating loss by $32 million from the first quarter of 2011, primarily on higher volume.  ", "At Bell, revenues were up $245 million on increased V-22, H-1 and commercial deliveries. Segment profit increased $54 million, primarily reflecting higher volumes and the mix of commercial aircraft.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were down $68 million, reflecting lower volumes. Segment profit decreased $18 million, primarily due to the lower volumes.", "Industrial revenues increased $52 million, reflecting higher volumes, partially offset by a $12 million negative impact of foreign exchange. Segment profits increased $12 million, primarily due to the higher volumes.", "Moving to Finance. Segment profit was $12 million for the quarter. Finance receivables ended the quarter down $267 million from the end of last year. Credit performance improved during the quarter with non-accruals ending the quarter at $290 million, a decrease of $31 million from the prior quarter. And 60-day delinquencies were $143 million, an improvement of $23 million from the fourth quarter.", "Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $47 million, up from $39 million last year, primarily due to the impact of -- that our higher share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was down $3 million from a year ago.", "To conclude, we remain on track for our full year EPS outlook of $1.80 to $2 a share and cash flow from manufacturing operations before pension contributions of $700 million to $750 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Greg, we can open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question will come from Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes. Can you talk us through the puts and takes on Cessna reconciling the 18% increase in aftermarket with -- which should reduce profits with what we saw and why you're so confident in achieving this for your goals for the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think, Heidi, if you look at the conversion rates, obviously, I think if you go back to the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, it's quite a bit higher than the 18%, but I do think that if you look at over the course of the year, we still think that given what remains kind of a difficult pricing environment and relatively lower volumes, you kind of get into a laundry list of things that are moving around. I still think that over the course of the year that, that's about the leverage that we'll expect to see. So we had a reasonable conversion versus the previous quarter, but I think as you look through the year, I still feel pretty confident it's going to end up somewhere around that 18-or-so percent.", "Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right, great. And one last question. Can you -- we want to dig into the Bell margins a little bit more. Talk a little bit about the sustainability of that and what sort of drove that nice margin performance.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the Bell margins, as you know, we've talked about the challenges this year of being around significant increases in commercial deliveries. Obviously, even within that there are some mix issues depending on the models. So I think for the quarter, obviously, we saw solid growth in terms of the military side. Certainly, commercial was up from 15 to 30 helicopters, but I think we're going to see even more significant unit growth over the course of the year on the commercial, and most of those are going to be somewhat dilutive in terms of margin rates. We also have increased R&D that's going up. So again, I think the numbers that we've guided over the course of the year is certainty attainable. The guys are doing a nice job in managing the ramp and controlling costs, but we are going to see a much heavier mix through the balance of the course of the year on the -- particularly on the wider commercial helicopter volume.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just quickly on systems, I wondered if you might give us a little bit more color about the decliners there. You had mentioned your expectations for flat revenues, although I recall in the last quarter, there was some commentary about conversion of some opportunities on UAVs. Any color you can provide us there on what you saw the decline in the quarter and what surprised you there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I don't know that anything surprised us a whole lot in the quarter. Obviously, the trend that we saw all through last year and that we still see into this year is just things moving relatively slowly in terms of getting contracts let, going through the whole proposal, evaluation and award process. We didn't have any surprises in the quarter, where something that we thought was going to happen either didn't happen or volumes were issued at a lower rate, and I still think that we're feeling like we're going to guide to a flat year. Obviously, what was important in the quarter as we came into the year needing to get a couple of very important wins on the UAS business in particular, and we won both of those. Now those don't generate a lot of revenue in 2012, so we said we'll spend most of the rest of the year building out the systems and getting those deployed per specific task orders with both the Navy and the Marines and SOCOM, but those things will all be out there. And they've got between 3 and 5 years of pretty solid revenue generation beyond that. So I think those were important wins, again, not so much they had a lot of impact or were forecast to have a lot of impact in 2012, but very important for us in the '13 to 'l5-or-so time frame.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And one quick follow-up for Frank. The corporate expense, you noted the step-up due to the higher stock price and relative to the amount, I think it was $145 million, you talked about on the last call for corporate expense for the year. How much should we be assuming that, that steps up as a result of this?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, it probably steps up about $10 million if the share price stays in and around these levels.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citigroup.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this DoD contract structure that you talked about on the UAS. Is that something unique? And how did this come about?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think this is a trend that you're going to see more of in this sort of a fee-for-service, so particularly these UAV vehicles, how much ISR is required and where is it required both by, in this case, the Navy and Marine Corps is one program and SOCOM being the other program, where instead of having the military tie up a certain number of systems, they're looking for the industry to provide those systems and actually own and operate those systems and be able to deploy as required. So I think it's trying to create -- at least, it's a tool they're looking at and a technique they're looking at, I think, to create a more dynamic, more capital efficient way of utilizing these kinds of assets. So instead of tying it up within the 4 structure in one particular location, by having those resources and that capital owned by the industry, they can simply issue task orders and deploy them as required in a much more capital efficient structure. I think that's the intent. And of course, the difference for us is, I think ultimately from a profitability standpoint, we'll do quite well on this, but it does require that we have that capital because then we're the ones that can turn around and respond to what their needs are and allocate those same resources in different locations at different times over a period of 3 to 5 years.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. Okay, that's helpful. And then Frank, you've mentioned that the guidance holistically stays in place. I'm wondering, given the results of this quarter, whether you wouldn't mind walking through the segment level guidance and maybe give us some puts and takes on what you're now expecting for the rest of the year.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, well, we're really the same in terms of that segment level guidance as we've -- there are puts and takes in and around the ranges, but generally within those ranges we're still fine with that. The one change to that being on the Finance segment, given the first quarter results, we had suggested Finance to be kind of breakeven-ish. We think that the captive business will be profitable as we had indicated in our outlook. We think that non-captive, given the performance we're seeing right now, probably is more around breakeven. So overall, we think Finance will be positive for the year versus breakeven, but otherwise, kind of we're in the same ranges on the segments.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "And then Jason, just to add to that, I think that when you think of the holistic picture there, Frank mentioned that corporate expense is going to be up a bit, we're looking at a higher share count given the share price as well. So all in, it still comes out into the same range as we're sitting here today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Back to the margin question at Cessna, you compared it to Q1 of last year. But if you look at it compared to Q2 of last year where deliveries were pretty similar overall but your mix was actually a little bit better this year. Last -- in Q2 last year, you were able to generate a profit. Could you maybe just compare this quarter, the moving pieces this quarter versus Q2 of last year where the deliveries were pretty similar?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, I think if you looked at the comparison, and we've obviously done that, David, just to understand sort of the moving parts here, I mean, you're right. We had a few fewer Mustangs than we had back in that quarter. There are some other mix issues pushing around there in terms of just the mix of the different models of aircraft that was -- that worked against us a little bit. But look, there's also some pricing that is still difficult in the marketplace out there. I think ultimately, we got to push to get that better, but it has not been favorable over the past year, so we took a bit of a hit on pricing. And I think really one of the bigger issues here is at the volumes that we're running and the cost structure we have, the numbers are such that things that would normally be sort of lost in the noise around LIFO adjustments and accrual for some severances in our Citation, you get down to sort of a laundry list of numbers that are frankly all relatively small numbers, but when you're talking about small numbers of absolute margin, they make a difference. So I guess, the bottom line is a little bit of unfavorable mix in the numbers of jet deliveries, continued pricing pressure and a bit of one-timers in there that normally I don't think would be something that would move the needle very much that in this environment is making a difference.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So R&D wasn't a major factor?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It wasn't a huge factor. I mean, again, you get into this saying, well, look, our R&D, absolute spending can go up, but we also had some stuff we wrote off in the quarter which went back to 2011. So at least, in that kind of a causal, if you look between those 2 quarters, not a major factor.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And as a follow-up, moving to Bell on the commercial side, 429 deliveries were a lot lower than where I thought they would come in. Talk about what's going on there, and have you gotten the certification for the 500-mile-range increase in the U.S. yet?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So 429, there's no change in terms of our expectation in 429 deliveries this year. There's a bit of timing in there just because of where they're laying in the year, so you're right, there was only a couple in the quarter, but there's no fundamental change in what we're expecting in terms of 429. That's part of the issue that's a pressure for us, obviously, in the next 3 quarters, is we'll see significant increases in things like the 429 models. The regulation issue, that's 500 pounds of capacity, which has gotten through and been approved by the Canadians. It is in with the FAA right now. I feel pretty good about it, and I think it's something that will happen in the fairly near term", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So kind of moving back to Cessna, could you tell us where is the level of any abnormal preowned losses or forfeiture gains, and maybe give us some color -- the trend in demand and pricing as we went through the quarter. I mean, do we enter the second quarter with any appreciable change, or is it kind of really the same throughout the quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think it's about the same throughout the quarter, Cai, in terms of pricing environment. In terms of the used market, I would say, it continues for the most part to be pretty stable. I mean, we're talking about fairly small numbers in terms of things like write-downs and forfeiture deposits. These numbers have become sort of a couple million here, fairly inconsequential numbers, so fairly significant. I would say, continued stability and when you look at our used available for sale of our kind of in-production models, they're getting lower and lower, right? They're down in the 5%, 6%, 7% of the fleet kind of numbers. So that piece of the market in terms of competition for new orders, which is part of what makes pricing tough when you've got relatively new aircraft out there, does continue to get smaller, but it's not gone.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then to the first question, the preowned losses or forfeiture gains, were they much of a factor?", "Frank T. Connor", "They are low -- very low single digits and largely offset each other.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, one of your competitors, Hawker, has asked for -- has a forbearance agreement with its lenders currently. If Hawker were to go into bankruptcy, would you be interested in pursuing any or all of that operation?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I guess, Cai, I would say that we keep an eye on that like most people, and there are certainly some assets there that we think would be very interesting.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes. So just firstly on Cessna, I mean, it sounded like from the volume outlook, at least, you are more positive in terms of order trends, what you've seen in Q1. If you could talk a little bit about maybe anything on, by region, what you're seeing and then also the effect that, that might have had on your sort of updated assumptions for things like R&D and CapEx. I mean, I think for overall Textron, you talked 3 months ago about R&D up $110 million, CapEx up about -- to about $450 million. Have you sort of changed any of those outlooks given what's happening with demand in Cessna and in Bell commercial?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No. I think, Julian, everything's very consistent with our plan. Obviously, the new product programs at Cessna, driven large part right now with the M2 and the Ten are in-flight test programs. The Latitude, obviously, is in its early stages of detailed design. The 525, as we announced, is also a program now that's in its early stages of detail design. So the CapEx associated with those programs, again primarily around tooling, which is really what's driving most of our CapEx budget there and the R&D numbers that we kind of guided to are all completely within what we expect them to be for the year. So there is no change. And again, in terms of the market, I think if you look at what's going on in the orders and level of customer activity at Cessna, it's where we expected it to be. So I still feel pretty confident about what we are thinking in terms of the total volume of deliveries for the year. And the same is true with Bell. The market's been strong, the backlog is there, the level of activity and order rate is where we expected it so that we should ultimately have the commercial deliveries fall in line with our guidance.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, I'd just add, the only thing that -- on the CapEx side that puts a little pressure on our CapEx number to the upside are these wins at systems. And depending on the volume ultimately of the task orders that are let, the amount of equipment that we would look to field this year. But we don't think that, that's a big number, but that kind of does have some impact on the CapEx number.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Right. The only differentiator there is those are revenue-generating numbers as opposed to what we traditionally think of as CapEx, right, which is around the tooling and our infrastructure. Those are assets that would be required to go perform those contracts.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure. And then just a quick follow-up on systems. I mean obviously you had -- in Q4, you had a charge around severance relating to the cost base and so on. You've had a decent sort of revenue drop here, but it sounds like the full year outlook is still flattish. How do you feel about the cost base in systems when you're looking out this year or thereafter? I mean, do you think you've done enough on the costs for the time being given that Q1 was, it sounds like, as you expected?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, I think, again, it's pretty consistent with our expectations. When we announced the restructuring and we looked at the costs and in particular, for the most part employees affected by that, where we thought we needed resources and where we thought we needed to do restructuring given the current environment, really remains unchanged. I mean, the reality is for some of these programs, particularly for these fee-for-service, where we actually will be adding resources to go execute those programs. But those are different people in a different skill set than those who've been affected by the restructuring. So again, Julian, I think, pretty consistent with what our expectations were going into the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "At Bell, can you tell us what the commercial aftermarket and military aftermarket growth rates were?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. We did see some growth there that -- those are not numbers that kind of we break out separately, but we are seeing growth in those areas -- and on the commercial side, it's at rates that are lower than what we've seen at Cessna, but we are seeing growth.", "George Shapiro", "Still double-digit numbers or below that?", "Frank T. Connor", "We don't kind of -- we don't break those numbers out separately.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then one, Scott, maybe if you could give a little more color on the JV with AVIC. I mean, you were talking about potentially a larger cabin jet. I mean, is this something in the Columbus category or even bigger, and if you could give some specifics about timing and development.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the timing, George -- as you know, the joint venture kind of goes through a few phases here. We started out by putting a completion center capability in Chengdu so that we can deliver basically a green aircraft out of Wichita and do all of our customizations interior completions, paint, finish and all that for delivery into China out of our Chengdu operation. Ultimately, we'll do some additional manufacturing work in the location and greater levels of assembly around the Sovereign and ultimately, longer term, around the Latitude. The new development program, which I think really, ultimately, will be sort of a highlight of this whole activity, is one where we really start the definition and kind of market research of what's the right product for the market as part of the formation of the JV. So that's usually a year or 2 activity when we look at most of our aircraft to really decide what are the right specifications, how do you really do the concept work and define the right product. Certainly, our expectation is that this is going to be a larger, longer-range aircraft than anything else that's in our portfolio, and that's why this is something that makes an awful lot of sense, both for us and for AVIC to invest in. There is no comparative analysis, I would say, against something like a Columbus -- it's not really working from the Columbus baseline . It's really working from what's the right thing given this timing and our current position in the market and, frankly, other things we've done in our portfolio. So I think any specific discussions or disclosures of technical specifications is probably a couple years downstream.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, I was wondering if you could comment on the market share situation, to follow up from Cai's question whether the issues at Hawker have had any impact on your market share and also with regard to your comment on pricing.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think the -- you've had historically 4 guys really working pretty hard at most of that market, 5 if you include some of the bits of Gulfstream and even Dassault to some degree at this point. But I think if you look at the market right now, and I'm sure you'll see this as it comes out through the industry data, is that no doubt you're going to see loss of share in the jet business at Hawker Beechcraft and I think that, that share is sort of dispersing itself between Cessna and Embraer and Learjet. I think, understandably, it's pretty hard to have a serious discussion with the customer about buying a $10 million, $15 million , $20 million asset if there's uncertainty about who's going to be there to support that aircraft. I mean, I don't think this is a secret, right? I mean, guys that are buying aircraft are -- buying the aircraft is just the beginning, right? I mean these are very long-life assets, and the support and have the manufacturer behind it is an important part of a purchase decision. And I think it's probably giving them a fair bit of difficulty right now given their financial situation. So I can't tell you or wouldn't guess at this particular point where that share is going, but I would suspect that it's moving amongst the other few big OEMs in those markets.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on the pricing issue. I was wondering what your assumptions are for pricing at Cessna through the rest of this year. Are you assuming they stay pretty flat or that they improve?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think it's going to -- it will vary probably a little bit from model to model and region to region. But we would like to think that as we bring new orders in place at this stage of the game that we're going to try to figure out how to drive pricing back up, but that's going to be a difficult fight on a deal-to-deal basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just a couple follow-up, a lot of ground covered already. First, just back to the, I believe, the first question that Heidi asked. Scott, I think she was talking about aftermarket, but it sounded like you were kind of talking about contribution margins a little bit. Can you just clarify your comments on what to expect for contribution margins on Cessna? Were you trying to get at that?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, I think if you look at -- well, I mean, we're not going to -- I don't think we've ever talked about contribution margins on aftermarket or whatever, I guess maybe I misunderstood it. I think if you look at our guidance for the year at Cessna, you get incremental margins on the additional volume year-over-year of around 18-or-so percent. Now in the first quarter, those incremental margins were considerably higher than that versus the first quarter of 2011. But I don't think that the incremental margins that we saw year-over-year in the first quarter are going to sustain that high. I think we ultimately will be around where we guided, which is about an 18% incremental margin on that additional volume.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Okay. I just wanted to clarify that because that was the same number as the aftermarket growth, and it just sounded like there was some apples and oranges in that.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "And it could be, Jeff, I'm sorry about that.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "No problem. And Frank, can you just give us a little more color on kind of how to think about cash flow? You have this big use and other assets and liabilities in the quarter and some working capital pressure beyond that. What's going on there? And how does that play over the balance of the year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. There's not anything unusual in the first quarter. First quarter is always a significantly negative cash quarter for us. There was some inventory build, there's receivables build, there was some timing and -- in terms of payments from customers and things like that, particularly on the military side, that can tend to be lumpy. So it was negative. It was a little worse than the prior year. If you go back 2 years, it was kind of pretty much in line with what we did in the 2010 first quarter and consistent with generally how we had planned the thing. And again, we believe for the year, we'll be in the $700 million, $750 million cash flow range, just as we had talked about in our guidance.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And then just on Cessna orders, Scott, I think you said Q1 was better than the first 3 quarters of last year, but maybe that's a little bit of kind of the small numbers on small numbers we've been kind of talking about. But can you give us some sense on where book-to-bill was and how you expect book-to-bill to play out into the second quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think you're right. I mean, it's growth over a small number, but it is growth. So we feel pretty good about that. I think on a book-to-bill basis, you're at like 0.75, right, if you looked at just the -- break out the first quarter numbers. But again, I think that what we've guided, our expectation in terms of what we saw in the order flow in the first quarter, what the customer prospect looks like, that we still feel pretty confident that we're going to see the kind of order flow through the course of the year that we need to get to the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, I was hoping to go back to the China JV for a second. And Scott, if you could talk about some of the coproduction platforms that you would think about moving over there and whether -- and how much that would help demand towards the end of this year, if not into 2013.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think by the time the -- we're doing the finalization right now, kind of the Ts and Cs of getting the joint venture itself, formed. We do have to go through the Chinese business license process, which can take a number of months. So we're trying to work towards a target where all these things will be lined up and ready to go at the end of the year. Obviously, we're already working on putting together the requirements in terms of what we have to do for a facility from a completion center capability in Chengdu so that as soon as we get all the licenses in place, we're ready to get all that stuff rolling and capitalize the business, but I don't think you're going to see any kind of impact really in 2012. I think maybe till late 2013, you'll start to see some flow in local deliveries. Now we already have Chinese deliveries, and I will continue to have Chinese deliveries anyway, but at a relatively small number through '12 and '13. But I think this really is something that will start to have an impact in '13 and become more material in '14 and on.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And as you look into '13, Embraer coming out with the Legacy 500, what kind of demand impact do you think that will -- or erosion potential impact that will have on your higher end of your line up, Sovereign in particular?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "That's kind of a difficult question to answer right now. I mean, obviously, there's things that we have going on. Latitude is a good example, where you look at customers that are looking for the larger cabin and that really addresses more specifically the 450, and I think gives us a much better aircraft, much better performance in that space and, obviously, there's some other things that we have going on that would, I think, address well what will happen in the space that represents the 500, which is obviously a bigger, considerably larger aircraft than a Sovereign, at a considerably higher price point than Sovereign.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Levenson from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On Textron Systems, you talked about the fee-for-service business for the UAS. And can you discuss what the margins are relative to an outright sale and where you think the additional opportunities might come from?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think the -- you wouldn't expect in a government environment to be able to negotiate a very different profit margin on what's expected versus what you would do if you were just selling these assets. I would say that the upside to this thing is that if the utilization ends up being higher, and we are good at utilizing the capital behind these things and the demand is greater, that, that represents upside to us. So I think on an apples-to-apples basis, you would expect pretty similar levels of profitability for the base case. And if we're able to more effectively use -- utilize the capital and there's a demand that allows us to do that, that I would say we would have upside.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the other opportunities are...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Just higher-level utilization, additional task orders.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Not necessarily from other customers though?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It can also be other customers, right? I mean, these assets are spoken for on sort of a task-order basis, and so it certainly can give us the opportunity, again, depending on what the demand is on these particular contracts can you also utilize those assets on other contracts over time, which could be with other customers as well.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And again, I'm sorry, domestics such as customs and border patrol, or more likely a European customer, for example.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "All of the above. I think this is a -- we're sort of in an interesting point right now. This is sort of the beginning of this kind of a concept, right, and so I guess, that's why I say when I think it could lead other opportunities, I think about all those kinds of applications. There's stuff within sort of civil applications like border patrols, monitoring of national or emergency areas or disaster areas. There's a lot foreign military applications, so I mean, obviously we'll be taking this model and trying to utilize it on a pretty broad range of applications.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I've just got a couple of questions for you, maybe just a quick accounting one. When you look at Textron Financial, what provisions were taken during the quarter?", "Frank T. Connor", "$4 million, Ron.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, $4 million. Okay, that's great. And then kind of switching gears to the Chinese JV, how do you think about protecting intellectual property when you go into something like that?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think it's pretty easy for us, Ron. I mean, people talk a lot about intellectual property protection, and I think if you're a consumer goods kind of guy, you probably rightfully should worry about that a lot. On the other hand, I think as you get into some more sophisticated technology, there are sort of national protections. I think when you look at China in particular, I think it bears some understanding. Chinese are also very brand conscious, right? So if you look at -- I think what we're doing is much more akin to what's happened in the automotive market than a lot of other industries, where the Western companies that went in and set up joint ventures with the government and did local manufacturing and really had a footprint in the country are the ones that not only enjoyed the growth of that market and helped make the market, but are still the brands and the products that dominate that market today. You go to China, whether it's Shanghai, Beijing or the smaller cities, it's VWs and Audis and Buicks. I mean, these are the guys that were first movers, and they still have very powerful brand presence. People make a lot about sort of the knockoff car companies, the reality is they haven't done all that well. You don't see very many of those. I think when you look at our business in the aviation space, it's even further sort of down that continuum, if you will. And that if you're in the country and you're finishing your final assembly on Sovereigns, you're not going to see a company down the street all of a sudden and pop out with a Sovereign lookalike. You can't -- aviation is a global industry. You have to have certifications, you have to have the FAA and the CAC. So if anybody is going to try to take our intellectual property and do a knockoff of our products, that's going to be a very, very, very public thing. You're not going to all of a sudden see these things on the market for sale. It's years and years of development, a very, very difficult certification process. So I frankly think that people are, in our case, in our industry, our kind of product, our -- this is not an issue to worry about. And frankly, I think you're much, much better off being in the market and participating in the market than thinking you can avoid that market and somehow not worry about IT by taking that strategy. I mean, you're more susceptible to having intellectual property issues if you're not there and participating in the market.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Interesting. I guess what the counterargument would be is what happened to some of the rail companies over there, correct?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'm sorry, to who?", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Like Siemens and some of the other companies when they were doing high-speed rail.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, and I've heard of some of that, but again, I think when you think about all the certification requirements, and again, people buy aircraft and fly them around the world. There's not a local market or a specific local project, it really has to be a global product.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes. And then maybe just one last question for one of you guys, there's been a lot of discussion on the call both from you guys and from other analysts about pricing. Doesn't it imply, I mean, if pricing is still soft, that there's just too much supply on the market, that either on the used end or on the new end, that there's just too much supply, and that's why we're not seeing pricing get better? That really the only way we'll see pricing get better is we just need less supply somehow.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I -- there's absolutely no question there's a supply and demand issue going on here and part of that supply includes those used aircraft. And so I think if you look at sort of competition in the marketplace, that's exactly the dynamic that you have going on. And so everybody -- I don't think anybody wants to short the market, right, as things start to come back, so everybody is doing what we're doing, you're trying to understand what -- where you think the market's going and you're trying to build to a forecast because you can't do it month to month, you've got a fairly long-lead assets here. But I think what we -- we would love pricing to get better tomorrow, I would love pricing to be better yesterday, but I think we are where we are in the cycle. I think the used, as it starts to wind down in, particularly on the stuff that's still in production kind of aircraft, will help get that supply demand back into balance, but you still have at least 3, really 4 competitors out there that are all trying to make sure that they keep their position in the market. So as demand comes back and it is getting stronger, you'll start to see that switch just like it has in -- every time you go through these cycles.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Have any M2 or Latitude orders in the quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes.", "Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Any numbers?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No. But, Steve, I just -- just to put some color, they're not overwhelming numbers, okay? I mean, we're in a position here still in the market where people aren't -- you don't see lots of people lining up that want to place orders for aircraft that aren't going to deliver until 2015, okay? So yes, there are some, there are certainly people that want to be sort of first in line for the aircraft and love the airplane and want to do that. Obviously, we have more entry-level buyers and some current Mustang guys who are already thinking about their step-up and then looking at an M2 and saying, \"That's where I want to go.\" Some of them have gotten to the point where they're putting money down and saying, \"Yes, I want one of the first units.\" But there's not a panic yet in the market of people saying, \"Geez, if I don't put an order in here real quick, I won't be able to get an airplane.\"", "Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right, right. And then you guys aren't going to give kind of your sold-out position for next year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No. That we're definitely not going to do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Since there are no questions on Industrial, just I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. Just given the growth you've seen in the first quarter, if you're going to have flattish sales, is there any part of that, that you're expecting or worried about weakening as we go through the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "The part I still worry the most about is around the automotive build. I think the first quarter is always strong in the automotive industry, I mean, just the way that cycle tends to work, and it was pretty strong. It was a little softer in Europe, which we expected, but it was also considerably stronger in North America, actually even a little bit stronger than we would have expected. Asia was stronger, but not as strong probably as we would have liked. So I would say in terms of how the quarter went, we're happy with what we saw in terms of volume and the health in the industry. But I'd say we remain still a little concerned about what's going on in the -- what will happen over the course of the year, particularly in the European automotive market. And we have a significant share over there, right? It's about 40% of our automotive business.", "Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just on that topic, is Kautex, do they use this nylon, that seems was in the papers today about shortages in their fuel systems? And how does that play out?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, so they do. All of the major suppliers of full-molded tanks use the, I think it was PA12 was what you're referring to. So there was an explosion at a plant in Germany that manufacturers that material system. So it's too early to say exactly what's going to happen. I mean, it certainly has the potential to have an impact. They represent a significant source of supply for that particular material so there's -- all I can tell you is there's active discussions underway with our customers about material systems, alternate material systems, sort of how to manage and sort of bridge our way through that, given what has been sort of a key supplier that has had a real problem. And that's not unique to us, by the way. I mean, that's material that feeds into everybody that makes this kind of a tank.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "As a follow-up, I think it's Cessna, I don't think you've talked about regionally. Could you comment, Scott, specifically on North America, what you're seeing? And is North America, if you look specifically at the North America book-to-bill, is that above kind of the Cessna average?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So I'm sorry I haven't done a book-to-bill on a per region basis, but I would say that the U.S. continues to be healthy, but I would say as we've gone into the year, we've seen some strengthening internationally as well. So I mean we're looking at order book that comes about, I mean I think over the course of the year and what we certainly see indicative in the first quarter, it's going to look more like a 60% international kind of a number as opposed to last year, which was more like a 30% and 70% U.S.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, just following up on David's question, Scott, how about demand-wise, you're seeing more for your bigger planes versus the smaller ones?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "George, the mix continues to be, in terms of the order rates, favorable. So we're seeing sort of stronger demand in the CJ4 and up than say the Mustangs. And again, that's kind of consistent with what we saw in the latter part of last year and what our forecast is based around for this year.", "George Shapiro", "And then, did you give or will you give how much R&D change from last year at Cessna?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Not on a by-business basis, George. But in terms of how you guys think about it, the only thing I would say is that we've talked increased dollars, still putting some pressure probably this year around percent of sales, but our expectation is that even though we'll continue to increase the dollars going forward, that we would start to lose that headwind in terms of percent of sales on R&D.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "It appears now that we've exhausted all the questions and follow-ups. So thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us, and we'll talk with you soon. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today through July 18.

Welcome to the Textron's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Thanks, Tricia, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to second quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $3 billion, up 10.7% from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations was $0.58 per share, which compares to earnings per share of $0.29 in the second quarter of 2011.", "Moving to cash flow, second quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $121 million and from that, we contributed $21 million to our pension plans.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter performance reflects continued growth in our commercial aircraft and industrial markets and improved operating execution across our businesses. We also continue to secure a number of key program wins and made strategic product announcements in the quarter that should further contribute to growth long term.", "Starting with Textron Systems, our Marine & Land Systems business won the Canadian Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle program. This contract calls for delivery of 500 vehicles beginning in 2014 with an option for 100 more, as well as an initial 5-year support contract. This was an important win as it extends our production of armored vehicles through at least 2015. This win also establishes a new family of our proven Mine Resistant vehicles, and we can now market to other customers around the world.", "Our TMLS business also won the Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector competition, which starts with detail design and construction of a test and training craft to be completed by early 2017. The contract also provides options for deliveries of up to 8 initial production units through 2020. So the total value of this contract could amount to $570 million over the remainder of the decade, with even more significant opportunity when the program enters full rate production.", "And finally at our Unmanned Aircraft Systems business, we recently received a $358 million award for engineering support and upgrades to retrofit 45 Shadow Systems with deliveries of these units beginning in late 2013.", "So despite a difficult DoD environment, over the past several months we've won several significant new programs that help solidify the long-term outlook and systems.", "Moving to our Finance segment, we had another successful quarter of liquidations as we reduced noncap to financial receivables by another $160 million, including a $70 million reduction in our Golf Mortgage portfolio, representing 19 loans. Our noncap to finance receivable portfolio now stands at $619 million.", "Shifting to our industrial business, operating performance was solid with revenues up 5%. Volumes in our Industrial businesses reflect strength in the North American and Asian auto markets offsetting European softness.", "Moving over to Cessna, we delivered 49 jets in the quarter, up from last year's 38, reflecting modest recovery and our success in the current market. We also had a number of strategic developments over the past several months at Cessna. First, we announced our new long-range super midsize Longitude business jet during the eBay show in Geneva. With a 4,000-nautical mile range and a speed of Mach .86, the Longitude will be designed to make nonstop flight between city pairs like New York and Paris; London to Dubai; or Beijing, Moscow. At a price of just under $26 million, we believe the Longitude will be the best valued 4,000-nautical miles super midsized business jet available in the world. We also continue to make good progress during the quarter with flight testing on our new Citation M2 and Citation Ten.", "Finally, our newly announced Latitude was selected by NetJets to become part of their fractional fleet offering, which should add significantly to the long-term demand for this aircraft.", "And to wrap up with Bell, on the military side we delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s versus 9 22s and 8 H-1s in last year's second quarter. We saw a significant increase in our commercial business with 47 units delivered in the second quarter, up to 25 from last year's 22 deliveries. This growth reflects the overall strength in global helicopter markets, as well as the ramp-up in our 429 program and the success of our new 407GX.", "To wrap up the quarter, overall manufacturing revenues were up 10% with manufacturing net margins improving 120 basis points. We believe this validates the investments we've been making over the past couple of years in new product development, our sales capabilities and manufacturing productivity.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $288 million, up $59 million from the second quarter of 2011 on a $269 million increase in manufacturing revenue. Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna.", "Revenues at Cessna were up $111 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting higher jet deliveries. Segment profit was up $30 million, primarily due to the higher volume. Excel revenues were up $184 million primarily due to higher commercial helicopter volume. Segment profit increased $32 million, reflecting the higher volume in a favorable mix in our commercial business.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were down $63 million primarily due to lower volumes in our weapons and sensors and land and marine businesses. Segment profit decreased $9 million, reflecting the lower volumes and deliveries on lower-margin contracts. Industrial revenues increased $37 million, reflecting higher volumes across most of the businesses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, primarily due to higher volume.", "Moving to finance, total finance receivables ended the quarter down $256 million from the prior quarter. Nonaccruals ended the quarter at $252 million, a decrease of $38 million from the prior quarter, and 60-day plus delinquencies were $169 million, up $26 million from the first quarter, primarily reflecting a few aircraft accounts.", "Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $20 million, down significantly from the first quarter, primarily the result of lower propelling share price, which reduced compensation-related expenses. Interest expense was $35 million, even with the first quarter. Our average share count during the quarter was 295.5 million shares, which was 19.7 million shares lower than last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit of having repurchased a large portion of the company's outstanding convertible notes.", "To conclude, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $1.80 to $2 a share, with cash flow from manufacturing operations before pension contributions of $700 million to $750 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So Tricia, we can open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you walk us through the strong improvements we're seeing in this quarter in Cessna? I think -- I can't recollect precisely, but I think Scott Ernest has now been there for 1 year. Can you tell us what has been changing with him and his team that's been most effective in these results?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "You're right. Scott's been in place for just over 1 year. And I think some of the changes that he's made in establishing real business segments, or P&Ls within the jets and propeller, military and service sector and the teams, the people we put into those leadership jobs are doing a great job on focusing both on where we're going in the future, product development, plans, kind of marketing strategy, but also sort of a stronger focus on their P&L and understanding their costs, understanding conversion costs and prior costs, warranty, really looking at the products a little more holistically along each one of those product lines. And I think the focus on that and trying to draw profitability back in the business is something that they're doing very well. And I think that's what we're seeing in the results.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Didn't we expect then, Scott, in the second half a steady climb in profits then as he gains, and he and his team gain greater traction?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well I think that you're going to see, obviously, the continued focus on the cost, but I do think we'll start to see a little more pressure on R&D spending as we continue to ramp up all the exciting stuff that we've announced. We actually have to go spend the money to make those things happen. And there's a couple of other headwinds. But there's going to be things that push back and forth through the quarter. But I would say I don't think there's any change in their focus around cost, and that will continue to support our margins. But we are going to have some headwinds around some of our R&D spending.", "Heidi Rolande Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And last question, obviously given the conservatism in your guidance, you're baking in and implying deceleration in the back half of the year. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes that kind of drives that conclusion?", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Heidi, I mean obviously coming through the first half of the year, we feel pretty good about where we are relative to how we expected the year to progress. But I have to say that we still look at the back half of the year in terms of what's going on with economies around the world in a lot of uncertainty. I have to factor in that, that will cause concern with a lot of our customers as well. And so we still have, as we have had now for the last few years, an awful lot of activity, particularly at Cessna, which requires sales, orders that then convert to sales in a relatively short period of time. And I think there's enough uncertainty out there in the economy, in the markets around the world, that it's best to still anticipate it's going to be a tough back half.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, I was wondering if you could give us your views on revenues for the full year and whether there's been any changes in the allocation by division?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, there really isn't, Robert. I think things are really -- there's no reason to change the kind of guide that we've given you guys the beginning of the year around each one of the businesses. Bell, obviously, I think is on track. Cessna is certainly on track. Systems, as we sit here today, is probably a little behind. We guided the revenue around that business to be flattish for the year. We're a little behind where we were obviously at this time 1 year ago. I think that's reflective of just the general slowdown of getting things through the DoD process. But obviously with some of the wins that we've had here in the past few months and some FMS activities, I think we have reasonable line of sight to expect the revenue to catch up on that business and finish the year about flattish as we originally guided.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And as a follow-up on Cessna, you've given us the backlog number for the quarter. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of maybe how orders and cancellations might have panned out this quarter.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, there were some -- certainly, still some cancellations in the quarter. I would say gross orders were pretty good. We still have some cancellations, and if you will just -- frequent of why we could still see cancellations at this point. And frankly, it's still driven by some orders that were in the backlog that date all the way back to sort of the 2007 MBAAs and CJ4 launches. And as you know, the backlog was way out for that model at that time and so as deposits come due, there still are some that are dropping out of that area. So I would say principally when you look at cancellations, that's what's driving it. The rest of the cancellation numbers are sort of immaterial.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Just follow-up on that, Scott. Was the gross book-to-bill at 1 or above 1 in the quarter then?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think if you look at gross, it was just barely above 1.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And what happened to the aftermarket at Cessna? I mean, how much did that grow in the quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "The aftermarket was up sort of in mid-single digits. On a comparable basis, it wasn't as strong as we've been seeing, but we had a very strong comp from the second quarter of '11 because a lot of fleet refurbishment activity was going on. But it was still up a healthy, healthy mid-single digits.", "George Shapiro", "And you had very strong incremental margins. I mean is that just a volume, or did the large number of XLS deliveries help that? And why shouldn't we expect that incremental to continue if you adjusted for the higher R&D?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think if you look -- I mean for sure, gross margins continue to be good. I don't see a change in that going forward. But as I said, we are going to see more R&D coming into this thing, and we're still at a point here where the numbers are relatively small. And plus or minuses, whether it's inventory adjustments, that will have an influence. It's bigger than we would like just because the number's relatively small at this point. So at this stage of the game, I mean, I certainly feel good about what the guys delivered on the quarter. We'll continue to drive hard but at this point, I would say I don't see a reason to guide outside of the margin range that we gave you for the total year.", "Frank T. Connor", "And George, the comps going forward at Cessna are going to be a little tougher, too. As Heidi pointed out, the new management team got underway a little over 1 year ago, and so some of that immediate impact started to flow in the third, fourth quarters of last year.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick clarification questions. First, on TFC and the outlook for the rest of the year and moving into 2013. Obviously, we've had some better-than-expected performance relative to your initial guidance of breakeven for the year. Can you just give us some updated thoughts on -- yes, look, not just for this year, but as we kind of move into next year given what you know today?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think that most of what we're seeing that has been upside to what we would have guided, Jason, has to do with our successful liquidation in the Golf Mortgage portfolio and the fact that we've been able to liquidate those notes at better than where we mark them when we took the mark last year. And so obviously, those come through as a gain. Now eventually, obviously that's going to stop. I mean, we've had 2 good quarters of those liquidations. I think we'll continue to see good liquidations of that through the balance of the year but obviously as we start to think about 2013, we have a better sense of how those are liquidating now. So when we get around to kind of guiding you toward 2013, we'll consider that but that is going to end, right? I mean those receivables are dropping fairly quickly, which is good news. But as you look out, I'm going from -- starting the year with 381, we're already down to 244. These things are going to run through the book. I hope we'll continue to run through the book pretty quickly. I would hope that we will continue to see some positive numbers come out of that as we liquidate them better than their mark, but that will end.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And as far as the timing on the ending, do you have a sense of that? Is it in calendar '13 or we see that this year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean our -- it's hard to tell, right? But our pace right now has been sort of in that $60 million, $70 million over the last couple of quarters. So even if we continue that kind of run rate, then you're going to be -- the portfolio we have, what it was as we get to the end of the year, which means it'll...", "Frank T. Connor", "We'll still in number -- in '13. We still expect, obviously, liquidation activities in '13. As Scott said, it's going to depend on the pace of liquidations for the second half of this year and where those liquidations take place relative to where we have, at least, the Golf portion marked and then we have other liquidations coming out of other pieces of the portfolio. It will continue.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I guess what we're saying, Jason, is you can't assume that level on a go-forward basis. I mean, that's not something we can bake into the TFC model on a go-forward basis, because it is really driven by a particular asset class and how that's liquidating. And as you know, that will come to completion as we finish that liquidation.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. Just 2 quick follow-ups then. On the Cessna cancellations, can you give us a sense of how much that might have contributed to operating profit during the quarter? And then Scott, can you just give us an update on V-22 international sales?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "On the former, Jason, the cancellation foreclosure numbers is de minimis. I mean, it's $1 million or something. There was not an impact on the quarter in terms of the margin rates really. In terms of V-22, on foreign military sales opportunities, we just came out of Farnborough. I would say we had a great show. The Marine Corps had 4 V-22s. Over at the show, they were providing demonstration rides for a lot of Foreign Military customers. It was a packed few days. They were terrific, in terms of supporting us. We had a lot of folks flying the aircraft, a lot of fabulous feedback. I would say we are in serious discussions with several different countries around the V-22 sales opportunity, and we remain pretty bullish that several of those deals are going to close. We'd obviously would love to see one happen this year. I think there's a possibility for that to happen. Remember, we're really trying to look at production slot availability out in that 2015 time frame as you start the second multiyear. So I would say right now, there is not a complete signed contract on any of those, but there are several there and -- that I think are real opportunities, and they're going to start to happen.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just want to go back to the full year earnings outlook question from the first questioner. And I just want to make sure I'm interpreting you correctly in that, I think you were saying the reason for just keeping the range and not raising it despite the large beat, at least versus our expectations, is simply because of the broader, higher-level macro and not because of an expectation for specific segments to get worse in the back half. Because you earned $1 in the first half, so you have to earn less in the second versus the first to get to the midpoint of your range, which in any normalized year historically has never happened. So just wanted to make that clarification, and if it is the businesses, which ones are the drivers?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, it is exactly as I said. We're -- I think if you looked at where Bell is today and where the industrial business is, the systems business I talked a little about, I think I have a reasonable degree of confidence in forecasting what their performance will look like through the balance of the year. But at Cessna, we are in the same mode that we've been in for a few years here, where we're taking orders and selling in sort of a 3- to 6-month window for the most part. And I still worry about the back half of the year in terms of what the market's going to look like. And that's just driven by, I believe, a lot of uncertainty in economies. I think there's a lot of concern about heading toward November, a lot of small midsized business guys who are our customers are very concerned about the balance of the year and where things are going in terms of election and politics. You've got debt ceilings, you've got sequestrations. You've got massive changes to tax policy. So I remain concerned that we'll have too many people sitting on the sideline as opposed to guys that are willing to make significant capital investments and hiring people and things like that. So I think it's proven at this point, given the uncertain nature of the economic and political situation particularly in the U.S., that we'd be a little bit cautious about the second half of the year.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, understood. And then as a follow-up to the Cessna order topic, orders weren't through the roof, but they were certainly -- they kind of held in there relative to how bad the macro was in the quarter. Can you talk about whether or not part of that is share gain? And you have new management and new product strategy and the degree to which you think you're taking share back from competitors that maybe had some inroads versus you. And then as a second question, when you mentioned gross book-to-bill being above 1, I think that's been the case for a few quarters. So what's the timing at which you think the cancellations finally end, such that even without core gross order improvement, you'd automatically have book-to-bill above 1?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Noah, I've been trying to stay out of the guessing game on the order book, but like, let me just say it. I think we feel good about what gross orders were in the second quarter. I think that it feels like we're taking some share. I haven't seen the MBAA numbers yet. Embraer's put their numbers out, but I haven't seen numbers from any of the other businesses. We'll obviously, we'll see that here in the pretty near future. But I would say that I think our sales teams are doing a great job in terms of coverage. Certainly a lot of new products that we've announced. This generated a lot of interest in our brand, and our product continues to be very well received in the marketplace. So I think we're continuing to do well, and I would guess that we have seen some share pickup in the quarter and I would expect that to continue. So it's not like I feel bad about where we are in terms of orders. Our order rate has been pretty good. I think the guys are doing a nice job out there. It's just caution in the macro environment that would cause us to feel strong enough at this point to take our overall guidance number up.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just a couple of questions, just back to R&D. Obviously, you do have a lot going on and R&D has to go up. I think in some of your prior conversations though, the thought was yes R&D goes up, but it doesn't outpace sales growth once we get beyond this year. Is that view changing?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, I don't think so.", "Frank T. Connor", "No, I think the comment, Jeff, was just that it's more back-end loaded than front-half loaded this year, but the longer-term look at R&D is still the same.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Right. And Scott, can you just share some thoughts on sequestration? You've taken the view that it won't happen. Unfortunately, you're taking that view because you're a logical businessman, right, and we're operating in a world where maybe things aren't so logical. So whether you think it's going to happen or not, what does Textron do if it does happen? I mean, how do you posture? Can you do things in advance? Do you even know what sequestration would mean for your businesses at this point?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, Jeff, I mean it really is something at this point that you can't plan for, because the fundamental flaw, in my view of sequestration, is it's just bad policy. If people decide that there needs to be a further reduction in the defense budget and obviously, the defense community doesn't like that idea. But even if you are going to take it down, the issue is you surely would never do it in the fashion it's laid out in the sequestration law, right, where you do a -- spread it across everything, every program, every spending item, everything gets hit by a common percent. I mean first of all, it would be a disaster for the government because that means every contract, every worker, everything out there gets impacted, which is going to result in a massive deluge of contract changes, requests for equitable adjustments. I mean it would cost the government more money than they would ever say. I mean there's actually contracts. You can't just go out there and arbitrarily change contracts without having ramifications of that. Just from a pure administration standpoint, you would never do that. The other course is if you're going to take more money out, and I'm not betting against, by the way, that they're going to take more money out. I think that there still could be, when they work their way through, I'd be very surprised if it's a lame-duck process -- session. But when you get into a new Congress and they actually start to figure out what they got to cut and what they're going to do about the deficits, that there could still be a further allocation of cuts to defense. But I think you have to let that go work the way it normally does, just like the first $0.5 billion of defense is already taken, where you go to the Pentagon, you go to Congress, okay, we're going to take up this much money. And there's actually a thoughtful rational way about what programs get hit, what programs don't get hit and you proceed down that path. So I think I wouldn't be very surprised if sequestration gets invoked just because of inaction in our political process. That wouldn't surprise me a whole lot at this stage of the game. But I think once that hits, there will be some emergency sessions and people will actually say, \"Okay, if we're going to cut money, here's how we have to do it.\" And the problem with planning for that is you don't know what programs they're going to go try to take money out. So I don't think it's going to be an across-the-board deal. I think that's an administrative -- it's bad policy. Administratively it's bad. It's bad for defense. But knowing where the cuts ultimately will come at this point would be absolute guesswork, and I just don't think we can -- we're wasting our time to even try and to do so -- a plan for that.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question on sort of big picture on Cessna, Scott, if you -- I wondered if you might compare and contrast the demand environment to the sort of summer slowdown periods we've seen in the past couple of years, and whether it's any different than what we saw last year, better or worse? And then a point of clarification with respect to the order book and the NetJets order and whether there's any portion of that that's included in the backlog?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Okay, in terms of the macro view of Cessna, I mean we certainly are not where we were 2 summers ago where when the euro, sort of crisis first hit, it sort of froze the market. We have not seen that level of reaction. Frankly, even with what's going on in Europe right now, we still continue to see order flow in Europe. Obviously, it's in -- mostly around countries that are still economically doing better than some others. So we haven't seen that sort of falling off a cliff where everybody just stops. So I guess in that regard, it's more like it was last summer, right? I mean we went through it and we kind of -- we muddled along, we continue to get orders. And I think there is still demand out there, obviously, for the product. There are still people who want to do upgrades, and they want to put new aircraft, and that's the flow that we're seeing. And so our belief is that's why we think we're going to continue to have a solid year. But there's still the macro overhang of it. So the macro level is certainly not like it was 2 summers ago when the market just absolutely stopped. It is much more like last year, and I would hope it will continue like that. That's what we seem to see in the demand right now. In terms of the NetJets order, no. None of the NetJets order is into our backlog. The process of how we're proceeding is that we will put aircraft into the backlog as we identify a specific serial number to be delivered to NetJets to fulfill their customer demand. And obviously with this aircraft coming into market in 2015 in the -- just really getting into the marketing and the selling process on the NetJets side, I wouldn't expect to see those aircraft going into the backlog for some time because again, we won't put them into the backlog until we see assigned specific serial numbers. And we'll do that on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. We will not put that entire order into the backlog at any point in time. It will come in on a aircraft-by-aircraft basis.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And one other just sort of brief follow-up. You mentioned the aftermarket performance at Cessna. I wonder if you might comment on what you're seeing on that front at Bell?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Bell aftermarket performance was good as well.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, kind of still good growth there.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Similar to the mid-single digit at Cessna?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Scott, last quarter you talked about the price environment being tough, being a headwind last quarter. Could you address pricing year-over-year and sequentially at Cessna?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I would say still a difficult pricing environment. As I indicated on the call in the last quarter, we saw tougher pricing on a year-over-year basis than we would like to have seen as we're kind of battling our way through things. In terms of sequential, we actually saw some modest improvements. We actually put a couple of those price increases out there in the market and then pull back on some of the allowances. And I think our sales team has done a nice job of closing a lot of orders and getting a little bit of price back.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "In terms of the Cessna, you noted your conservatism obviously with all the macro issues. But could you maybe talk about where you are in terms of being sold on the rest of the year relative to whatever delivery number you have baked into the revenue guidance, and how that would compare to the last couple of years when you were midway through the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, we're not talking about unsold positions at this point, David. But as I've said, I mean I think the reality of the market where we are and have been now for some time is that it's safe to assume a lot of the aircraft are going from an order sales process that's in the 3- to 6-month kind of time frame typically.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Last one, Frank, on the pension side, will you guys benefit at all from the recent change in the pension legislation smoothing the discount rate? From a funding standpoint, I think you were looking at pretty meaningful contributions on a go-forward basis.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. No, it won't have a big impact from a minimum-required pension contribution. It helps us to the tune of $30-ish million or so, so it's not a big number. And we've been making contributions just because of our funded status at levels, as you know, well above our minimum contribution levels and kind of we anticipate and continuing to do that for a bit longer. So it doesn't have really any impact on how we think about that.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, could you give us some color on the demand at Cessna, both by product, by geography and kind of the pace going through the quarter? Did it sort of slow down, as I would assume, kind of in the last part of the quarter, early July?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "You know, Cai, we didn't see much of a slowdown. I would say in terms of geography, both our orders and our deliveries at this stage of the game are kind of sitting in the 60-40, 60%, domestic, 40% international kind of market. And I would say it was pretty steady through the quarter.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And by product, I mean we've been hearing that maybe the mids and super mids are firming a little bit. You seeing any sort of areas stronger or weaker?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's relatively balanced. I mean the XLS plus had a very good quarter. We continue to see strong position in the CJ4s. There were some CJ2s, 3s. Mustangs were about flat, so it's pretty well across the portfolio.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then help me understand your comment, the guidance is the same, and yet your corporate expense is way down. And unless you're assuming your stock price surges, it looks like that's going to come in a fair bit lower than you expected. And you indicated expecting some more favorable adjustments on liquidation. So it looks like TFC is going to do better than expected even if it about breaks even for the year. So is this really conservatism, or help us understand why that guidance didn't change.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think that if you would accuse me of conservatism, Cai, I would say that it probably is conservative on our view of how we will do on Cessna for the balance of the year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it, got it.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "You're right that there's obviously some of the upside we've seen at TFC, associated with the Golf Mortgage liquidations. Kind of when you look at our overall guidance, I mean that will tend to push us towards the high side of the guidance based on that number being a number that is stronger than guidance. And I would -- I'd say that's going to be true, but I still think we're going to be a little conservative if you're on the total of your Cessna number.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Understood. Now you mentioned that R&D is going to move up in the second half, up sequentially from where we were in the second quarter. And was the second quarter may be not up much from the first and not up much year-to-year, so it's really the R&D profile has something to do with the numbers of the full year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Well, we've never talked about quarterly kind of R&D because it does fluctuate, Cai, depending on kind of different things that are going on with different programs. But it will -- and we always expected it to be a bit back-end loaded relative to the first half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So I guess firstly, just on Bell commercial, you've been fairly positive on that for sort of 6 or 9 months, and it certainly seems to be coming through in your numbers. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for volume delivery growth in Bell commercial over the next sort of 12 months? And also, what's happening on the pricing side there, given that you've had this inflection on volume?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think on the volume side of Bell, the year is playing out very much as we expected and guided, so we are going to see for the total year, significant growth in terms of Bell deliveries. And I think you're seeing that here in the second quarter as we had pretty strong deliveries on the commercial side. I expect that will continue through the balance of the year. I think we'll see particularly strong mix increase on the 429s and our 407s. As I said, I think both products are doing very well in the marketplace, and pricing has been good. The market -- the demand is strong around the world and so as you would expect, there's been some pricing power as well.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just sort of yet another question on Cessna, unfortunately, but if -- I just wondered how you're thinking about the sort of business jet, taken from landing data to the sort of the traffic data, and how that affects your outlook for the second half? Because I guess the U.S., you had good growth for sort of 3 years, and that's largely expired. The U.S. traffic seems to -- in Europe, sorry, traffic seems to be down a little bit. So how does that -- when you're thinking about, I guess, second half or the next 12 months, the core assumption around traffic growth versus market share gains that you can get from price, how do you think about those 2 drivers for Cessna volumes?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We don't look at that a whole lot in terms of volume driver. I mean we certainly look at average deal utilizations, and there's some tie-in, in terms of looking at the service business and there are people using their aircraft or not using their aircraft, and that's been pretty steady in the last year or so. It went down a lot, obviously, from the '07, '08 kind of numbers. But the number that we see right now, in terms of the ADUs for the quarter are very consistent with what we saw last year. So people are using their aircraft, and as a result they're coming into the service centers, and they're \u2013 having maintenance work done and upgrade work done. So I think it's -- that, that piece of utilization is something we look at more around what is it driving in the service business as opposed to new aircraft sales. On new aircraft sales side, we tend to look more at the metrics around what's available in the used market and what percentage of the fleet that's out there is available for sale. And those numbers continue to go the right direction. We were down -- we believe our fleet now is down somewhere just above 12%. And in particular, if you look at the models that are still in production models and what's available for sale in the market of those model types, for most of our models that's now down in the mid-single digits.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then finally just on the industrial business, very good core growth, sort of 11% much better than a lot of other industrial companies this quarter. What's the update there on the sort of the investment program there, and how you're thinking about the cost base? I mean, are you investing sort of substantially to make sure that type of growth continues, or is it sort of largely a one-off court, and do you think the growth will normalize from here?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, a lot of the growth is driven. I mean if you look at our Golf and Turk markets, those were pretty hard hit. Those have started to rebound a little bit, so I think we saw good performance in the E-Z-GO business, across not just Golf, but also the commercial and consumer markets. We had a reasonably strong quarter with Jacobsen. You see more people going back and having to replace mowing equipment. The industrial tools business did well. I mean we had some FX challenges there, but volumes and profitability continue to be recovering in the industrial tool world. And Caltex, we've kind of hung in there. As we said, we've seen some softness in Europe, which is our, probably our biggest market for that business, but that was offset by a continued strength in the North American market. And I would say probably growth is not as strong as it has been in Asia, but it's still growing in Asia in terms of the automotive market.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Scott, I think you're probably going into or in the 2013 strat planning sessions and looking at Cessna and coupling that with your commentary about the second half's economic geopolitical uncertainty. Are you still looking for higher production at Cessna into 2013 that you'd kind of preliminary pass along to the supply chain come September?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, you're right. We have -- we are in that process. In fact, we've just completed doing that with all the businesses, so we are developing a view, I would say, at this point in time. But I would say we're not at the point where I would start to talk about issuing 2013 guidance on the businesses.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess the near-term activity, if you decouple it to that second half kind of event risk situation, I mean, would that still make you comfortable that you're in what you've talked about before of kind of consistent recovery, maybe it's slower than previous cycles, but still a recovery nonetheless?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, absolutely. I would say the macro level, I wouldn't change the tone of our view that we will expect sort of a steady slow recovery in the market. The issue, of course, is that can have some peaks and valleys along the way, and so we always have to keep an eye out for that. But no, there's certainly -- in terms of talking to customers and looking at the activity that's going on in the market, looking at demand and where it is, we don't have any reason to feel differently than this, like the midsized jet market, will continue and make a slow steady recovery. And obviously, part of what we factor in is with a lot of the new products that we're putting out in the marketplace, we would expect -- certainly expect to see some share growth over that period as well. So I don't think anything versus what we've told you in the past is different in terms of sort of macro mid- to long-term view of the business.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then a clarification, I guess, on delinquencies. I know it wasn't a big pickup sequentially, but I think it's the first one that was seen in the last couple of years, if not longer. And I think you said it was aircraft customers. So I'm curious when is the trend going to start going the wrong way? And is that indicative of either higher-risk customers coming into the portfolio or customers who've been in there a while starting to show weakness?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, I mean, you're right. The 60-day delinquency trend was driven by a couple of sizable aircraft accounts. I mean I never liked to see a data point that goes the wrong direction, but I mean it did go the wrong direction, but I don't think that's going to be a trend. I mean these are customers that we know, we understand, there's a couple of specific issues that are going on, but I don't think they're -- I don't find it personally alarming at this point. I think it's something that we'll be able to get under control and get the delinquency heading back in the right direction.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And these aren't necessarily customers, or are these customers who entered the picture in the last 24 months or customers who have been in there longer?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, no, no. For the most part, these are guys that have been on the book for quite some time.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Steve Levenson with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I think all the good questions have been asked. I just wondered if you had any commentary on the developments around Hawker Beechcraft, the price discussion and if you think the door is absolutely closed to any sort of participation by Textron?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the HB process is certainly not closed to anyone at this stage of the game, right? I mean they basically have entered into a negotiation process with a, what is effectively a stocky horse in the normal bankruptcy process. So I don't think it's certainly technically not closed to anyone. On the other hand, I'd say the number that's out there is a number that's a pretty high number, so we obviously, as everyone will kind of watch it as it goes through in a pretty public process and just going to see how it plays out.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess you might like to get that valuation for Cessna.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I -- we think we should.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with BofA.", "Elizabeth Grenfell - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's Elizabeth in for Ron this morning. Just a follow-up on the last question. What implications do you think there could be for Cessna from the recent deal to sell Hawker to the Chinese with your Chinese partnership?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean again, this is a process that I think is still fairly early on. We'll see how things work out. If in fact the Chinese do buy Hawker, then it means Hawker's still in the market. So we've been competing with these guys for a very long time, and we'll continue to do that. Frankly, I think if you look at the investments that we're making and things like the Latitude and the Longitude, the things we're doing with our service network, for the reasons that we've been very successful versus Hawker Beechcraft in the last couple of years are the reasons that we would continue to be very successful against those products and that capability in the marketplace regardless of who happens to be the equity behind it, so...", "Elizabeth Grenfell - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So what about your deal to build a new airplane with the Chinese?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well yes, I mean, we're still continuing our discussions with AVIC. I think the Chinese market is going to be a big market. And there's going to be a lot of competition in China. Obviously, the things that we've been trying to do with AVIC is to give us capability in the country that we think will be attractive to customers to help make us competitive in China, but I don't think by any means do we think we'll ever be the only guy to oversell in China. I mean everybody sells in China today, and I think everybody will sell in China tomorrow. We continue our discussions with AVIC to see if that's not something that gives us a competitive advantage in that marketplace. And so from that perspective, I don't see that as a change.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, just a couple of -- it's probably more nitty things. But was there any LIFO benefit at Cessna in this quarter like you had in last year's second quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And that's a -- there was a slight sequential decline in the margin at Bell even though revenues were higher, and maybe it's too small to worry about going from 14.6 to 14.4. Any reason for it, because commercial was better?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean commercial, obviously the commercial mix is usually somewhat dilutive in our margin. We did have -- when I talk commercial, I'm talking about OE, right? So when you see more unit volumes, things like 429s and 407s in terms of the original equipment sale, those tend to have some dilution. But you're right, we get into 0.001 site, I wish I was that good, George.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, that's what I figured.", "George Shapiro", "All of our businesses, as we've seen, have a fair amount of quarterly volatility to them. There's lots of ins and outs.", "Operator", "And we do have another follow-up from Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just one quick one, back to the Hawker Beechcraft process. Obviously, the defense piece of that portfolio, the trainer businesses is still out there. I wondered if you might comment on whether that's something you'd still be interested in or any comment would be welcome.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Carter, I think that we have the same general view. These are assets in which we have an interest but again, it would have to be at a value that we thought was appropriate. In general, I would say this whole situation with HB, we've always expressed an interest. I think some of the assets of the company are interesting and would be a good fit in our company, and that we could do the right thing for their existing customers and our customers. It would all work. But at the same time, whether it's the overall HB situation or the defense piece, these are things that I think, given the investments we're making, given the position where Cessna is today, I feel great about what our team is doing. So we don't have to do something here. If it's the right value and it will be accretive for our business, then absolutely we're interested. But if it's not something that's going to be a good financial deal and it's not going to be a good investment for our shareholders, then we'll pass on these things.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Is it your perception that, that piece is going to have a sufficient number of interested parties?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's a good question, I don't know. I mean you can imagine a couple of people that would be interested in it, but I think we'll have to wait to see how that plays out.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs for a follow-up.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just had one follow-up on systems. You've obviously put up a number of nice wins there that start to flow through beyond 2012. And right now, we're seeing the business show negative growth. And beyond the 2012 period, you probably still have a number of headwinds. I know you don't want to talk specifics beyond 2012 yet, so I wondered if you could just say, with everything you want and everything you know about the legacy business, do you think systems is up or down in 2013?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well again, Noah, I think it's -- it would be premature to get into 2013 guidance at this stage of the game. The only thing I'd really talk to is around 2012, and we are behind a little bit where we would like to be on the revenue side of things for '12. But I think with some of the wins we've had and some of the dynamics of the business right now that we still think we'll probably get back to about flattish for the year.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And can you comment on just directionally, positive or negative next year or too early to do that?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think it's too early to do that. I mean a lot of these programs we've talked about on Ship-to-Shore is a relatively small impact to this year. It's a little bit bigger impact to next year but again, primarily driven around research and development. TAPV, there are -- is a fabulous program win, but that really is production volumes that are -- later on, I mean we're already kind of where we need to be in terms of maintaining productions as we go through next year. So the TCDL win obviously is something that will help a little bit next year. So I think -- I don't think you're going to see a big swing one way or the other in 2013.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just one last question here on systems, and I apologize if you've already answered this question, but I didn't quite hear the details. The outlook for the rest of the year to get back to roughly flat, can you just give us a little bit of detail, Scott, on what needs to happen in the back half of this year? What programs specifically do you think are going to see an acceleration in the revenue outlook for the back half of the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, we had a couple of programs that drove some of the -- caused us to be under where we are today, primarily driven around some FMS transactions where it was a matter of getting through the finitization of contracts and getting things signed, which I believe have happened now. So I think we will be able to firm up more in the back half of the year. I guess I'd rather not go into a specific contract-by-contract basis. There's a lot of contracts going on, right? I mean we have talked about some of the larger and more strategic wins. But when you look at things that are going on, options that are being exercised on armored security vehicle business, upgrades that are going on in the UAV business, some FMS sales in our precision munitions business, these are all sort of full business, if you will. But those things, many of those things have been just difficult to get through the whole process and get the finitized contracts done. So the things that we knew we were going to have, there was no question about, was the program going to happen or be funded or not, it was just a matter of getting under contract, getting finitized and getting everything lined up so that we can get about with doing the production and test and sell them. The slowdown, that was what caused the first half to be a little softer, but I think we'll recover that in the back half.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then to your question -- your comment on pricing, it says in some of the price increases, is that fairly broad based at this point or is that kind of model specific?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It was pretty broad based. The price increases were on a couple of specific models. But incrementally, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we saw some pricing improvements in virtually all models. And I think there's only one model I can think of where the pricing was sort of flattish or -- versus before. But on a quarter-over-quarter, virtually all the models were off a little bit in price.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Okay, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, today's conference will be made available for replay after 10:00 a.m. today until October 16 at midnight.

Our income from continuing operations was $0.48 per share, up from $0.45 in the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $153 million compared to $339 million in last year's third quarter. We contributed $16 million to our pension plans during the quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Our third quarter results reflected strength in our helicopter industrial units, continued favorable liquidation activity in our financial portfolio and good execution at Cessna in what turned out to be a weak business jet demand environment, especially in July and August. The quarter also reflected charges \tassociated with our new fee-for-service unmanned aerial systems programs, as well as lower volumes in the Systems business.", "As you know, earlier this year, Systems won 2 contracts associated with our Aerosonde platform to provide UAS services to the DoD on a fee-for-service basis. Cost estimates for these programs were based on our extensive experience offering Shadow Systems for the DoD under government-owned contractor-operated contracts. We thought most of the operating expertise would be directly transferable to the Aerosonde platforms, but it turns out, the operating know-how did not transfer well, and we had significant start-up issues during the quarter as we began systems deployment.", "To address these issues, we augmented training, procedures, added resources and adjusted our estimated costs to support the programs, such that we expect they will operate at a loss during the initial phase of the contracts. Consistent with contract accounting rules, in the third quarter we recorded charges of about $14 million representing the expected losses on these contracts. So we anticipate the Aerosonde activities will be recorded at breakeven through the next 3 quarters, having already booked the estimated losses.", "We are also experiencing some delays in our TCDL and SFW programs. Therefore, I think it is likely that we will miss our original full year guidance at Systems for flat revenues by about $100 million to $200 million. Looking forward, we will focus on improving program execution at Systems.", "Moving to our Finance segment. We had a successful quarter liquidations as we reduced noncap to finance receivables by another $161 million, including a $90 million reduction in our timeshare portfolio, which included payoff of the largest remaining individual timeshare credit, plus a $60 million reduction in our Golf Mortgage portfolio, primarily as a result of loan sales. Our noncap to finance portfolio now stands at $458 million.", "Shifting to industrial. Volume has reflected normal summer seasonality, but we continue to see year-over-year volume growth in our golf and turf and auto fuel systems businesses with an overall organic growth rate for FX of about 7.5%. We do believe that we will see some volume softness in the fourth quarter as it appears that the European export auto market and the Japanese OEM auto business, reflecting current Japanese-Chinese tensions, are expected to be slower in the fourth quarter.", "Moving now to Cessna. We delivered 41 jets in the quarter, down from last year's 47, reflecting the weaker summer market. Specifically, July and August were very quiet order months with a pickup of activity in September. In the meantime, we believe that generating essentially flat segment profit with fewer jet deliveries demonstrates the progress we're making with our overall cost structure at Cessna. We also made good progress on the new product front during the quarter, starting with an announcement that we increased the range of our Latitude by 25%. Latitude will now be a 2,500 nautical mile airplane, which we believe significantly enhances the value of this offering to our customers. Our design team was also able to announce a new top speed for the new Citation Ten at Mach 0.935 preserving its gestation as the fastest commercial jet in the world.", "We also had important announcements in the quarter with 3 new global company-owned service centers. Most recently, we announced the acquisition of a service center in Doncaster, U.K., which followed the announcement of a new service center in Valencia, Spain. During the quarter, we also announced the opening of a new joint Cessna Bell Service Center in Singapore. These investments in aftermarket infrastructure are extremely important to both Cessna and Bell, as they capture future annuity streams in the form of service revenue and create a stronger touchpoint with -- for our customers for future sales.", "To wrap up with Bell, on the military side, we delivered 11 V-22s and 5 H-1s versus 9 V-22s and 7 H-1s in last year's third quarter. We saw another significant increase our commercial business with 46 units delivered in the quarter, up from 26 last year. This growth reflects continued overall strength in global helicopter markets, as well as the ramp-up in our 429 program and the success of our new 407GX.", "To wrap up the quarter, we continue to make great progress strengthening the portfolio with Finance on favorable terms. At Systems, we experienced some execution difficulties during the quarter, and we are addressing those. Industrial has maintained growth and good operational execution in an otherwise challenging economic environment. I believe Cessna did a good job in the quarter, closing new orders in a very thin market. And they have made such substantial progress with their overall cost structure over the past year. Bell continues to execute well in both its military and commercial businesses.", "Finally, across our manufacturing units, we remain committed to making investments in new product development, sales capabilities, service capabilities and manufacturing productivity.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing segment profit in the quarter was $254 million, down $6 million from the third quarter of 2011 on a $154 million increase in manufacturing revenues. Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna.", "Revenues at Cessna were up $7 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily reflecting higher used jet sales, which more than offset lower new jet and other product line sales. Aftermarket sales were up approximately 2%, which was against a tough comparison as aftermarket sales were up 13.7% in last year's third quarter. Segment profit was $30 million, down $3 million from last year's third quarter.", "At Bell, revenues were up $181 million primarily due to the higher deliveries of commercial units and V-22s. Segment profit increased $22 million, reflecting the higher volume. At Textron Systems, revenues were down $62 million, primarily due to lower volumes. Segment profit decreased $26 million, reflecting the fee-for-service charges Scott described earlier, and lower volume. Industrial revenues increased $28 million, reflecting higher volumes across most of the businesses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $1 million, primarily due to the higher volume, partially offset by cost inflation in excess of price increases.", "Moving to finance. Total finance receivables ended the quarter down $233 million from the prior quarter. Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at $145 million, a decrease of $107 million from the prior quarter. 60-day delinquencies were $114 million, a $55 million improvement from the second quarter.", "Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $38 million in the quarter, up significantly from the second quarter, primarily the result of higher prevailing share price, which increased compensation-related expenses. Interest expense was $35 million, flat with the second quarter.", "Moving now to cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions was $168 million versus $455 million at this point last year. The most significant drivers affecting the lower cash flow this year are lower advance payments on military contracts at Bell, an increase in Cessna used inventory, reflecting higher trading activities and the wind-down of our Citation air fractional program, plus an increase in inventories at Systems related to delayed program activity. For full year 2012 manufacturing cash flow, we are maintaining our target of $700 million to $750 million.", "To conclude, in anticipation of continued positive performance at Bell and our outlook for jet demand at Cessna in the fourth quarter, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance from $1.80 to $2 a share to a range of $1.95 to $2.05 a share.", "That concludes our prepared remarks, so operator, we can open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to ask about Cessna demand and orders. In the past couple of quarters, you talked about cancellations still impacting the Cessna backlog. I wondered if you could speak to where gross orders and cancellations were this quarter versus last. And then in the context of that, I believe you've commented that Cessna book-to-bill could go above 1 before the end of this year or sometime soon simply by having cancellations come down if gross demand doesn't change. I wondered if you thought, if you still think that could happen next quarter or in the next couple of quarters.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Noah, I would say that in terms of cancellations, the cancellation number continues to come down. It was down again in the third quarter. This issue for us, of course, is the third quarter was fairly light in terms of gross orders, so order activity, as I said, was very, very light in July and August. We did see it coming back in September. So if you look at the gross book-to-bill number for the quarter, was probably somewhere around 0.85. So obviously, for it to get above 1, we need 2 things to happen. We need to see a continued reduction in the number of cancellations. I feel pretty confident that trend is obviously going to continue. We expect the cancellations will continue to come down and are really at a point where they're becoming pretty de minimis here going forward. But we need to get better gross orders. And certainly, what we're expecting is that despite a pretty tough market here in the past quarter, that we'll see a more normal gross order level activities in the fourth quarter as compared to what we've seen in, say, '11 and even '10. So that's I think a reasonable assumption in terms of what we see going on in the market. And September was certainly better, but in terms of gross orders recovering from a very, very quiet July and August, just really wasn't in the cards.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And so I guess when you put all of those considerations in, anything you can share on the current thinking for where you'll put 2013 production versus 2012?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, we're certainly not at a point where we're ready to give guidance yet on 2013. We'll do that in January, but, I mean, I think it's obvious as you watch through the course of the year, and not knowing what's going on exactly in the market, at this point, you' probably think something that's going to be around flattish, but we'll give a more refined guidance for you when we get into our January call.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one more on the Systems charge. Did you say $13 million, 1 3?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "$14 million, sorry, 1 4.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So the margin would have -- I guess the operating margin would have been somewhere a little north of 8.5%, excluding that. That's kind of trending below where you've been the past few quarters. Is that sort of the run rate going forward? Or are there other reasons that should come back up on an adjusted basis?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think that if you think about next quarter, in particular, the revenues that we book associated with that program being in the 0 margin, that's probably not a bad way to think. But in terms of a longer-term run rate, no, I think we'll still expect to be higher than that. There were a couple of things obviously that hit us in the quarter. One was, as you know, the charge associated with these programs, which is, frankly, are just an execution problem and one that we have to go work on. But we also had delays in some volume deliveries of programs that are good programs and will deliver. But we have deliveries that were supposed to be in the third quarter, which are now moved into the fourth quarter and even into 2013 that are good, normal margin programs. And that was also a part of what was leading to the drag on the margin rates.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Can you tell us how many used Citations you did deliver during the quarter and maybe the sales and earnings associated with that?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure, Pete. This is something that I think is important to understand when you do the analysis on Cessna margin rates. The revenues were roughly flat, but that's because we had an additional $30-some million of used aircraft sales. So really, what happened here in the quarter, is that as a result of the light orders early in the quarter, our deliveries, as we said, was down to 41 versus 47 on the new side, and that revenue or bulk of that revenue was made up for with used jets. Now it's good that the used jet market is moving and that we're able to start -- to move more used aircraft. But the way that we account used aircraft is basically we end up selling those at 0 margin. So that's a particularly bad mix when you see fewer new deliveries and more used deliveries. And so you effectively had $30-plus million of 0 margin business in there. When we bring used aircraft in, we book them at their market value, and generally, that's about where we sell them. So it's really a 0 margin mix.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Understood, understood. And then in terms of the gains on canceled jets, less than $5 million? Or was that any meaningful number?", "Frank T. Connor", "Not a meaningful number.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, not a meaningful number.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then I guess I just wanted to ask you, one thing I'm trying to get clarity on, could you update us on the status of the business jet depreciation rules as we go into 2013? Does accelerated depreciation end at this point? And if so, what kind of impact do you think that will have?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think it's still 50% first-year depreciation.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So no meaningful change kind of going into next year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, no. and I think the one thing, other thing, Pete, when you talk about one of the dynamics in terms of these cancellations and forfeiture deposit gains, and the other dynamic, of course, is valuation of used aircraft. As we've said over the last year or so, these numbers have become small numbers, and they are still small numbers. But I do think you have to [ph] understand that I think if you went back to the third quarter of 2011, these were sort of mid-single digit number gains, primarily driven by the fact that what few deposit forfeitures you had left was greater than revaluations. You look at this third quarter, again, it's still a mid-single digit number, but it's a mid-single digit number the other way, okay? Because there are very few forfeiture of deposit gains owing to the fact that cancellations are way down. But there's also a little bit -- again, these are small numbers in terms of revaluations, but when you add a small number the right way and the small number the wrong way, you end up with a number that's sort of like a $10 million number.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Understood, understood. And if I could just sneak in one last one, I promise. The FAA denying the 429 weight increase. Can you talk about the impact to sales there going forward and the probability that you can work around that and maybe the timing? Because it does sound like that could be a catalyst if the FAA does approve it.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, we certainly would see it as a catalyst if they do. I mean, obviously, Canada, which is the primary touch [ph] certificate holder has approved it. We've had about, I think we're up to about 10 other countries now, have approved it, based on the Canadian approval. And so we have seen some sales. I mean, because we're able to market the full performance of the aircraft in those countries. As you know, the FAA has denied that extension. Obviously, we're appealing that, and we're working with the FAA to try to find a path to do that, whether that is through just a straight appeal on the exemption or whether there's some changes in how they view the part 27, part 29 certs. I think the FAA is trying to work with us and understand the situation and see if there's not a path to get there. But that will take, obviously, some period of time. But in the meantime, in quite a number of international markets, we're able to market and sell the full capability of the aircraft. And obviously, we hope to be able to do that in the U.S. as well.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Scott, just a couple of quick questions again on Cessna. First, can you describe the pricing environment for new aircraft? And then secondly, what the fourth quarter's shaping up to look like from a seasonality perspective?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure, Jason. So I mean, pricing remains difficult in this environment. It's still a pretty thin market and very, very competitive. There are some models that saw some better price, and there some models that saw some worse price. And I think that's kind of been the story here for a little while, and I would expect it to be a still a bit of a struggle going forward given the market. In terms of the seasonality of the fourth quarter, again, what we're assuming in our plan is that we'll see a fourth quarter in terms of order rates and activity that was similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2010 and '11.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just got one last one on Cessna. Can you just describe where we are in China from a market development perspective and just offer up some updated thoughts there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure. So we are actively engaged. As you know, we signed a, sort of a framework agreement with AVIC. We are in active discussions on 3 separate -- with -- the structure of these is that you've got the AVIC and ourselves and then whatever municipal government associated with particular product lines, which are in different regions of China, which was part of the plan, was to have us be in several different operations. All those 3 negotiations are, I would say, progressing well. I think we're very close to getting the finalized agreement on at least one, perhaps, two here in the fairly near future. And the third, which was sort of on the back burner for a while, has kind of come back to a more active state of negotiations. And I think we'll get that done in due time as well, so they're all progressing as we expected. And as you can appreciate getting through these negotiations and setting up new operations in -- with 3 parties at the table is not easy. But we're -- been working through that, and I think we're making good progress.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wondered if you might talk about the -- I think you mentioned briefly what you saw on services. But I wondered if you could speak to Bell and what you saw in terms of spares in terms of commercial versus military, what kind of trends you're seeing there.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We don't usually break out the commercial versus military...", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Were they directionally different? I'm just trying to get -- some other competitors have talked about weak military spares. Is that a trend that you're seeing in Bell?", "Frank T. Connor", "It is not a trend that we're seeing, Carter. Year-to-date, we're up high-single digits, overall in aftermarket at Bell.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And briefly, you mentioned in Industrial some anticipated softness there later in the year. I wondered if you might talk to sort of the magnitude of that, what you may be seeing in terms of order trends, especially on the automotive side.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, on the automotive side, of course, I mean, fourth quarter seasonally is always a lighter quarter on the automotive side of the business in general, because they tend to shut down towards the holiday seasons. We're expecting it actually to be a little bit lighter than it normally would be, and it's really driven by 2 things. As we've gone through the year, Europe, which was supposed to be very soft all year, we certainly saw some softness in Europe, but some portions of Europe, particularly those models of vehicles, some of the large sedan, higher-end vehicles that are very export-driven, continued to be pretty strong through the year. And we've seen some softening of that here, and we expect some softness of that in the fourth quarter as the export market is a little bit slow and as opposed to most of the softness being sort of within the European consumption. So I think that will be a trend of some softening in the fourth quarter. And then the other, which is a very, sort of event-driven exercise, is that this latest flare-up between China and Japan has effectively led to sort of a unofficial boycott of Japanese product in China. And so the Japanese, still an export, but in particular, some of our larger customers in China are Japanese OEMs that have manufacturing facilities in China. And they're taking their volumes down dramatically as a result of Chinese people not buying Japanese-branded product, even those that are made in China. So I don't think that's necessarily a macro trend. And some of that share will certainly shift to other places, but it is a -- I think it'll be a bit of a problem in the fourth quarter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just one last quick one. With respect to the DoD contract environment and the fourth quarter activity, usually a big quarter for the government at the end of the fiscal year. Did you see anything that looked different, either better or worse, given sequestration sitting out there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, I can't say that we've really seen anything very different. It is still very difficult to get through the contract-negotiating process and the order processes. It's taking extraordinarily long periods of time to do that, but that's a trend that we've seen for the last couple of years. On the sequestration front, you hear sort of anecdotal things from different people about people either trying to accelerate getting something under contract or delaying something under contract, and everybody wants to attribute to sequestration. I'm not really sure you can do that. I think people are sort of trying to read the tea leaves or read things into different activities also, say, with sequestration. Our view on sequestration is, in light of the fact that the government has not guided DoD, DoD has not guided the contractors, that we need to just let this thing play out. Obviously, some of our larger programs, like the multiyear that we currently have with V-22, we would not expect any impact on sequestration on that. We don't see it as a huge issue for us in the very near term. And so rather than worrying a whole lot about it, I think we need to wait, and let's see what happens as we go through November and we go through the lame-duck session and get to where sequestration is either invoked or not invoked or how it's invoked. I would say the good news for us is we will give you our guidance in the mid part of January. And by that time, I think we're going to know a whole lot more about where this sequestration process is going. But for us [indiscernible]...", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, I thought I'd kick off with Cessna. You mentioned you had some, an increase in used sales this quarter. But I was wondering if you could comment on the broader used business jet market, how the inventories are looking, how the pricing is looking, and perhaps how financing is tracking as well?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I would say the used market, if you look at it, it has picked up. The number of transactions has increased across the whole market. Obviously, we see that in our business. In terms of pricing, it remains quite flat. And also when the books come out, each quarter, there's, obviously, there's normal depreciation of valuations, but we haven't seen big moves one way or the other. I mean, we've seen some models where they've ticked up slightly, and we've seen others where they've ticked down slightly in terms of how BRF and the Blue Book guys view the aircraft. But so I would say on the positive side, transactions are happening, the market is moving. But again, I think there's still -- even though the numbers have come down dramatically, it is still probably in all fairness more of a buyers' market than it is a sellers' market.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And on the financing, how easy is it for customers to get financing for used aircraft, do you think?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'm not aware that there's any particular issues. I mean, again, most of the aircraft that we deal with, particularly the older aircraft, are probably at a price point right now where it doesn't take a whole lot of money to get a reasonable LTV on a note, and people seem to be able to get financing.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And secondly, on Bell, you mentioned that the civil helicopter market showing some good strength there. I was wondering if you could comment on how your market share has been tracking, and what your initial thoughts might be for where 2013 could go on the civil helicopter market?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think the market has remained strong. We feel pretty good about how our products are doing out in the marketplace. I would say that we believe we are still continuing to gain some share, and we'd like to think that we'll continue to do that. I think the 429 has proven itself to be an outstanding helicopter and is doing very well and competing and winning around the world. Things at the new 407GX that came out, is doing is ordinarily well, I think, and continues to pick up share in that segment. So when you look at some of those new products that are out there, and I think John and the team have done a very nice job of sort of doubling down on our sales efforts and increasing the number of resources we have out there to make sure that we're covering all the regions. We continue to do very well, and I think we'll -- I feel pretty good that we'll stay on the trend.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Just a couple of other things coming back to Cessna. Scott, just thinking about Q4, you characterized some more seasonality to 2010 and 2011, but those were actually very different years, right? In 2010, we had a triple in Q4 versus Q3 with that big back-end load, and then last year looked a little bit more normal. I just wonder if you can put a little bit more of a fence around this and give us some color on what to expect in Q4, what's anticipated in your guidance for Q4 for Cessna.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, look, Jeff, I think we have been sort of guiding for the total year to be up modestly. And I still believe that's where we're going to end up, is up modestly. As you know, we've tried to work hard all year to get this thing to be more level loaded. We certainly did not want to have the kind of a hockey stick delivery year that we saw, for instance, in '10, and to some degree, in '11. Obviously, we were successful at doing that in the first couple of quarters. We saw deliveries that were well ahead of the pace or deliveries that were well ahead of the pace of what we've seen in those previous years. I would be kidding if I didn't say I would've hoped the third quarter would have been a little bit stronger in terms of the number of deliveries, but the summer months were pretty tough. But again, as I -- seeing what happened in September and we look at what we need our deliveries to be to be up modestly over last year, I think that, that's still a reasonable plan. So it'll be a few more deliveries in the fourth quarter than I would have liked to in terms of trying to level load this thing a bit more, given a few deliveries light in the third quarter from where I would like to have been. But I think given the order environment and what's going on, I think that's still in the cards.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And then just thinking about the outlook going forward, and obviously, everybody's crystal ball is pretty darn cloudy. But you made the comment after kind of a slow summer, you see some return to kind of normalcy. I mean, is there something your customers, in particular, are pointing at? I mean, does the market get better in your view regardless of who wins the election, for example? Is it -- what kind of body language, if you will, to the extent that there is any, do you get from the customer base and the outlook the next quarter or 2 in order intake?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Jeff, I would say that if you look -- and again, Cessna, our primary customers are small and mid-size businesses. And there's no question that a lot of these guys are looking at a very uncertain next few months, right? I mean, you've got an election coming up here in a few weeks. You've got the whole so-called fiscal cliff, you've got tax policy, you've got sequestration. There's plenty of reasons to right now and say, \"Jeez, I don't know what's going on.\" I personally believe that -- well, okay, so a lot of these guys would probably prefer to see one outcome versus the other in November, but on the other hand, I think people will wake up the morning after the election, they may be happy, they may be unhappy, but to some degree, people are going to have to dust themselves off and say, \"You know what, I got to get on with my life.\" Right? So I think that a lot of these things that are giving people pause right now will -- people will get over these things, right? I mean, so as I always like to say, it's -- you'd rather have good policy than bad policy, but at least have policy, know where things are going. And so I think that the election will play out somewhat like that. It'd be better to go one way than the other, but either way, I think it takes some uncertainty off the table and that's probably good for the market.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And just finally from me and I'll yield the floor. Just can you give us any color on where the 2013 delivery of -- deliverability of backlog stands? In other words, how much long-tailed stuff is still in backlog and how much is conceptually deliverable in '13?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Jeff, we have not been given our sold-outs or anything like that. I think that -- I mean, you guys see the backlog number from a dollar basis continuing to come down. I think that the market, the way I would see it in 2013, at this stage of the game, is going to be very much a repeat of the 2012 market. So the bulk of what's out there, the bulk of the activity that has to happen in terms of selling aircraft, is going to involve getting orders for aircraft. So that's the way we've been playing here for a while and I think at this stage of the game, that would be my view of how 2013 continues to play out.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "How much of the $28 million in profit at Finance was gains on liquidation sales, sales of assets? And do you expect TFC to be in the black in the fourth quarter?", "Frank T. Connor", "So Cai, I think TFC is probably closer to breakeven in the fourth quarter and kind of, there were the -- of the profit at TFC, about 2/3 of that profitability was non-captive in the third quarter, related to both kind of good liquidation activities at Golf, as well as some non-accrual returns in the timeshare business. So the captive business was about 1/3 of the profitability. There was kind of some good credit performance embedded in that, as well as just kind of more normalized profitability level out of the captive business.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, terrific. And getting back to Cessna, Scott, could you give us some -- you've done a fairly good job, but maybe some more color with respect to strength or weakness by geographies and by product? I mean, certainly looking at your mix in the quarter, the big stuff was up year-over-year. The little stuff wasn't in terms of the jet. So give us some color on where you see the weakness.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think on the -- if you look at the deliveries of jets themselves, Cai, you're right, the mix is favorable, in that it's been tending more to the sort of CJ4, XLS Sovereigns and the Mustangs in particular. So that is good mix for us. In terms of the question around geography, our deliveries in the quarter were about 2/3 in the U.S. and about 1/3 international, and that's versus a trend we've had that's been more like a 60-40 trend for the last few quarters or so. So if you look just at the jet deliveries themselves, I think that was a positive for us in terms of mix. The issues that were a little more trouble was having a lot of used aircraft in there, okay, which is very bad mix, in that they're basically just a pass-through, so they're not a margin. A little bit of, obviously, I would say, net pricing continues to be a challenge. So even though you had some good mix in there, I think we continue to still battle a little bit with some loss of price. And then as I said earlier, while they're small numbers, they do matter in terms of the overall result at this point, just because the overall number is small in terms of percent of naught percent, are things like the residual and the fact that thankfully, as a result of cancellations going down, we're not seeing a whole lot of forfeiture gain. So those are sort of the primary issues that are going on in terms of mix, Cai, that sort of nets out to where the operating margin landed, good on the new jets, challenged by used and again, some relatively small numbers, but things that are headwinds associated with price and just sort of the other items like residuals, values and gains associated with deposit forfeiture.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "If I look at the sales, it looks like either the prices were down or the parts and service were down, because given on those deliveries, I would have gotten a slightly higher sale, so is that the case for parts and services down? And secondly, was R&D up sequentially in this quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, R&D was not up sequentially, so that was not a headwind for us. Parts and services were up, but only by a very small, 1% or 2%. And again, we didn't see a real change in dynamic in the service business in the quarter, but we're just comparing against the third quarter last year, where it was up about 14%. So and I would expect in the fourth quarter, our parts -- we'll continue to see the rate of parts and services, which was healthy in the quarter, but it was just on a V basis, a smaller piece of it [ph].", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then you had the spectacular performance at Bell on strong V-22 deliveries. Can you comment on how large were your cum catch profits on that program in the quarter? And how much more gas is left in that tank?", "Frank T. Connor", "There were not cum catch adjustments, or EAC adjustments, on those programs that had any impact on the numbers.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I had a question on the core kind of gross margins in Cessna, because I guess it sounds like R&D isn't doing very much, some effect from the used aircraft which you've discussed a lot. But I guess overall, when looking at the gross margins in that business, do you feel that there's still a lot of room operationally to push that higher? Or now it's really a function of waiting for volumes? And I guess on pricing, you had mentioned on the last earnings call that your sales force had tried a couple of price increases. The rhetoric this time is very different. So I guess if you could give an update on how that went on the price increase efforts and when you think you'll next try those same efforts again.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think we made some moves on a couple of aircraft types where we saw demand that we thought warranted the market tightening up enough that we could get some price through, and we have seen that on a couple of models. But we continue to have some other models where we're not able to get price through. So it's sort of a -- there's definitely mix within each model type, Julian, it's not that we don't believe we can get the price through on each model. I mean, so, yes, we've had some success, but in some areas we have not had success in driving that price. And that very much has to do with just the dynamic of the market right now and the number of opportunities out there and what the competition looks like. So obviously, that's something we'll continue to work on, and I think that getting a little bit of stronger demand obviously would help that in the marketplace. In terms of our gross margins, we continue to work the gross margin side of the business. I think we have made some overall improvements in the total cost structure of the business, both fixed and variable, and we'll continue to drive that. So we're not going to wait for volume to save us on that thing. I mean, we continue to drive productivity across all sides of the business, and I think there's still some opportunity for us to get better at that even with flat volume. Obviously, our plan here is try to position these things with a cost structure so that we get very good leverage when the volume comes back into the business, which I think is inevitable. But we're not going to just simply sit and wait for that either. So the cost activities will continue regardless.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then, just quickly, I wondered on the Hawker assets, I mean, you gave some update last time, if there was anything to add this time, in your thinking.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, there really isn't. We haven't -- we continue to sort of watch what's going on, and obviously, as everyone knows, they've been in sort of an exclusive negotiation period with the Chinese buyer, and to the best of our knowledge, that process is continuing.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then finally, just quickly on Bell commercial, in a lot of industrial end markets, you're seeing some slowing in larger project CapEx. It sounds like Bell commercial, though, in terms of order intake, still very, very good. I just wanted to make sure that, that was the case, you haven't seen any slowdowns or deferrals there.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, we haven't. Our order intake and strength in the market on the commercial side seems to be sustaining.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "One more on Cessna and then a couple of others. Was there any LIFO benefit last year or this year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes -- there was not a LIFO benefit this year. There was a kind of mid-single-digits benefit last year.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then actually one more on Cessna. And then, Scott, as you looked at September this year, how did it compare to September last year? And I don't know if this is -- you can say it or not, but if you got similar orders the rest of the year that you got in September on a month basis, would the book-to-bill be above 1 in that situation?", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Well, before Scott answers, because I -- let me just say that trying to go down to a month-by-month compare [ph] is a very slippery slope, because when an order comes in one day to the next and so forth, I think that's a difficult thing. But obviously, you picked up September recovered. And if that continues, that would certainly be what we hope for.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes. George, I mean, I just, again -- Doug's right, I want to be careful here not to get into quarterly order flows, but let's say from an overall color standpoint, the third quarter this year was certainly very September-loaded. If you consider sort of that rate, then that's kind of the market dynamic we think we need to be able to meet our total year guidance of up modestly. So the answer is, kind of flat. Yes. Right? I mean, if we can maintain the order rates that we saw in September through the balance of the year, then I think we end up meeting our guidance of being up modestly for the year, and that's kind of our expectation.", "George Shapiro", "September this year, Scott, compared to September last year was better, I assume?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "George, I'm sorry, I do not have the month-to-months on this year versus last year. The third quarter this year was just slightly below the third quarter of last year, but I'm sorry, I don't know. I just don't recall off the top of my head the dynamics of the exact number of aircraft orders per month in the third quarter last year.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then switch to the Systems. The charge that you took on those contracts, Scott, I thought those contracts were like 3- or 5-year contracts. Are they broken into yearly pieces, so you'd have a 0 margin for the first year and then the opportunity to make money in the second year of those contracts or...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, that's correct. I mean, they're -- effectively, George, they're broken into options, okay, or task orders is the way they do it. And so -- but if you look at the task orders, they roughly break down to sort of 1-year duration task orders. So we have already been operating under the first couple of task orders associated with one contract. We've just begun the first task order of a second contract. And so these charges pertain to those initial task orders. And so we have effectively, we -- and the way we do our program accounting, the way we treat our EACs, all the stuff that we would normally look at, we treat looking at those on sort of a task order basis. So yes, the charge relates to our view of those task orders, the costs associated with those task orders and that's how we drive the charge. So you're right. These are, depending on those numbers of task orders that get exercised, they're probably more in the 3- to 5-year sorts of ranges. And so obviously, these can still turn out to be good programs. But our execution here in the initial phases of executing these first few task orders has not been good, and that's what's reflected in the charge, and obviously, we're going to do everything we can to work hard and be able to meet that even booking of the balance of these initial task orders and obviously to position ourselves in a way that we get the kind of profitability that we expected on those future task orders.", "George Shapiro", "And then maybe one for you, Frank. I mean, just give us an update of what pension might look like for next year, if you had to mark [ph] them up today?", "Frank T. Connor", "Sure. And obviously, it's -- there's a lot that can happen between now and year end, and we haven't kind of run any of the numbers definitively. If we maintained the existing assumptions from this year kind of going into next year, there'd be a slight headwind associated with next year's pension number, a kind of $15-ish million type number. Obviously, it remains to be seen kind of what the underlying assumptions are ultimately related to return and discount rate. On the discount rate side, we've given some sensitivities in our 10-K, but kind of for instance, a 50-ish basis point change in discount rate, has a $30-ish million kind of impact on pension expense, to give you some sensitivity around kind of those assumptions. So that's kind of generally the framework. And obviously, there's kind of fair amount that can happen between now and then in terms of what those numbers ultimately look like.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "As you talk about Cessna being flattish into '13, I guess I would have thought you'd get some contribution from the Citation Ten and M2 coming into the market. Are those not going to be big contributors? Or is the rest of the core business more where you're seeing the kind of the puts to the gains on the Citation Ten and M2?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, we will see some Ten activity, although that is very more sure as the latter part of 2013. We will have, we think, a reasonable volume of M2s as that comes into production. But we're still -- and then this is why -- I mean, I'm trying to be careful, because I'm really not trying to guide a number, okay? But I mean, just given the overall market dynamic, there can be some positive contribution by the fact that we have some of the new product getting out there, but we're also seeing not a market recovery through the course of this year that we would necessarily have liked to have seen building the kind of momentum into '13 that we would have hoped for. Now maybe that'll change as we go through the fourth quarter, right? So fourth quarter is always a very important quarter and we'll get a lot of these other issues around elections and fiscal issues and whatnot, out of the way. I think we'll be able to provide you a lot more visibility into our thoughts and rationale for how we get into 2013 guidance.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "The other one, Frank, you talked about the reason for lower manufacturing cash flow year-to-date. And I think you cited Bell advances, higher Cessna use, Systems inventory growth. I'm just curious, 4Q looks like it'll have to be as good as what was last year's 4Q, which was really quite impressive. I'm just curious, are there any of those things that you talked about as being weak points in the first 9 months that are the triggers for reverses to get you over the hump in the fourth quarter? Or just what's the put and take to kind of get you where you need to go?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. I mean, as you kind of do the numbers, essentially, we're looking at a fourth quarter this year that was similar to fourth quarter last year. And that's -- we always have a seasonally very strong fourth quarter. Obviously, the seasonality at Cessna, some seasonality at Bell, contributes to that, the timing of some of the kind of group payments coming from the military customers in terms of performance-based payments and just other contract activity, and we generally see significant inventory liquidation because of that seasonality. And kind of other seasonality with some of our other businesses result in the fourth quarter. So kind of we do expect that we will see similar cash performance this fourth quarter as we saw last fourth quarter.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Is there a big tick up in Bell backlog in the fourth quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So Bell backlog, remember, there's always a couple of things that happen with Bell in the military side because we take things into backlog as they're funded. The one issue that I think we should be sensitive to is that last year was the last year of the funding of the final year of the multiyear one contract, okay, which generally goes into our backlog in the fourth quarter. Given that the next funding increment to go into backlog will be associated with the next multiyear contract, which I don't believe will be definitized and completed into -- some time in the first, even second quarter next year, that will come to backlog, but I don't believe it'll come to backlog in the fourth quarter like it generally does.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "But that's not a big year-on-year headwind to cash?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, no, no. That wouldn't be calculated [ph] at all, in terms [ph] of the order. I thought you said -- the question was order, so...", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It was, yes.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, okay. The order seasonality will be a bit different just because of the dynamic of the next multiyear, but that should have no impact on cash.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Scott, back to Cessna, a lot of questions on what your guidance was for the fourth quarter, but I think last you had out there, you had Cessna revenue guidance for the full year of $3.4 billion. Does that still imply? Because if it does, it seems like it implies a fairly big delivery number in the fourth quarter.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Yes, David, Doug here. I think that our guidance will be more around a $3.3 million [ph] area plus or minus depending on where the exact deliveries come in.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then while we're on that subject, because I think you said Systems now $100 million to $200 million lower, what about Industrial and Bell relative to the prior guidance?", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "I think Bell will come in maybe just a little bit higher than its original guidance of $4.2 billion, and obviously at this point will probably exceed the top end of our range of margins maybe by about 50 basis points. With respect to Industrial, I think that we had originally guided to an approximately flat revenue of $2.8 billion. That'll probably come in about $100 million greater, even with the softness in the fourth quarter. And margins there should be at the top end of our range of 6.5% to 7.5%.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And on Systems, if -- taking your full year guidance, it seems like it implies a fourth quarter that's flat to up versus last year, as compared to this quarter, that was way down. I mean, what changes in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw in the third quarter?", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Our catching up with some deliveries, David.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, there were some deliveries that were pushed on the volume side from third quarter to fourth quarter. Some of those actually will go all the way into 2013, but certainly, there's some of that delivery that moved from third to fourth is what contributes to that.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can you tell us which program, Scott?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Primarily around our TCDL program for the Shadow, data link updates.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then last question, thinking about 2013 and cash, obviously, you have a fair amount of debt that matures early in the year. But thinking beyond that, could maybe Frank talk about pension contribution next year, and then maybe addressing the dividend and what you're thinking on potential share repurchase for next year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. Certainly, on the pension front, we, first of all, obviously, kind of will give guidance in January and we'll talk about that. We're still going through our budgeting cycle. We will continue to contribute to the pension plan in 2013, and we will continue to prioritize, as you mentioned, cash towards debt pay down early in the year where we have a significant amount of maturities coming due. But we certainly have cash on the balance sheet and cash from operations to satisfy that. And then, from there, we'll look at other applications of cash. And kind of we're just going through our planning cycle right now, so it's too early to kind of talk about what that looks like. And the focus, certainly, for the first part of the year, will continue to be on that debt reduction and contributions to the pension plan. We talked in our disclosures about kind of over the next number of years, continuing to prioritize some amount of cash towards pensions in the amount of kind of $50 million to as much as $400 million a year to continue to fund those liabilities. And that all depends around, in part, the interest rate environment and the discount rate environment, and therefore kind of the funded position as well as the performance of the portfolio. So we'll continue to look at that as we plan out next year as we go through the next couple of months.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Could you give us figures, what percent of the fleet at Cessna is available for sale? And within that, what percent is current models?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Steve, I have to get the numbers out here, because I don't want to quote an incorrect number, but there has not been a huge change, really, since last quarter. We were still sitting in the 12% total fleet, but I don't know that we give it on a model-by-model basis, but of the in-production models, the number has really been sitting down around the 6% or -- kind of range.", "Frank T. Connor", "Mid- to low-single digit depending on the model.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's good enough. And do you find yourself any closer to potential orders for V-22 internationally?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I would say that the international V-22 opportunities are, in my view, still looking very feasible. There are several that are in process with customers that appear to have a very high level of interest and are requesting information and sort of initiating that process. These are all FMS programs, so they have to go through the LOA/LOR notification -- going through that whole exercise, but they are in various states of making progress.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You -- on the last call, you had talked about R&D ticking up in the second half of this year at Cessna and just -- I know you don't want to talk about specific dollars or percent of sales, but can you just talk a little bit about how the R&D profile looks now with Latitude, Longitude, Ten and others? And then, year-over-year, how should we be thinking about next year's growth in R&D?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, as you said, we don't like to get into the numbers on a business-by-business basis. I would say that, like everything else, one of the things we're trying to do is make sure that we're being productive and efficient in our R&D spending. So it is still a very high level of spending compared to revenue. But I do think we've reached a point where it's probably not a headwind when we think about our percent of sales on a go-forward basis.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then I know we've talked a lot about Cessna, but just as you look at the fourth quarter, there's really only 10 weeks to go, do you have unsold positions remaining this year in this fourth quarter? And is in the Cessna, all of the variance between -- in the $0.10 between the low end and the top end of the EPS guidance?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, there are unsold positions and that's been sort of typical as we've gone through the last few years. There are obviously a lot of discussions going on with customers. And so the process we go through to determine what we think the deliveries will be is, in fact, based on some orders converting to sales within the quarter. In terms of the variability of the range -- I mean, there's a couple of moving parts in there. Certainly, Cessna is part of that. If we were to come up light on deliveries that would obviously be part of that. There are still a lot of things on the systems side of the business that have to deliver in the quarter. And that drives part of that variability. That's probably the bulk of the range. But for sure, Cessna is always, in the market that we've been in, a significant piece of the variability of our range.", "Operator", "Next, we'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Just to follow up on the used aircraft sales at Citation, I was just wondering, is the majority of that related to trade-ins on the large NetJets order that you guys had? And if so, I'm just wondering what the profile is going forward. Should we assume that, that $30-something million is kind of constant over the next couple of years? Or do you expect that to come down? Just any kind of color there if you're able to.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So, as Frank said, I mean there's a portion, maybe 2/3 of the used that's going on in inventory in terms of our increase in sales that's associated with trade-in aircraft. And I think that trade-in aircraft is a bit of the reality of where we are in the market right now because when you talk about relatively short-cycle sales, the ability for people to go out and externally market that aircraft, wait for it to sell before they take delivery, is challenging. And so as a result, we've been doing that and then we take it and turn those aircraft over. The other part of the used in terms of inventory, and obviously some of the sales is, the unwind of our CitationAir fractional business. So those aircraft are put back and we unwind those fractional transactions, those also go into our used aircraft and then we turn around and need to go market and sell those aircraft. So I don't know -- I mean, I would say right now that we probably have had more trade-ins on a per aircraft, new aircraft transaction than we typically do, and we would expect over time to see that number start to come down again. But yes, there are certainly...", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "You'd expect it to be less of a headwind in 2013, is that a fair statement?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We would like to see [indiscernible]...", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Marginalized?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "2013. Yes, we would like to see fewer trade-ins.", "Frank T. Connor", "And just to be clear, that $30 million was the year-over-year change in used. That's not the total used. The total used is a larger number than that. Total used...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Right. That's a -- when I gave the $30-some million number, that's a year-over-year comparison that we had, in -- greater, $30-some greater, in used aircraft sales as opposed to new jet sales.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a quick one. What is your year-to-date return on your pension plans approximately through September?", "Frank T. Connor", "Cai, I think we are kind of low-teens type number.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call today. Thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay starting today at 10:00 a.m. and going through January 17, 2013 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's recording conference call will be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host and your facilitators, as well as your Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Thank you, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to fourth quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $3.4 billion, up 3.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $0.50 per share compared to a loss of $0.06 in last year's fourth quarter, which included net charges of $0.55 per share. This year's EPS included a previously disclosed $0.06 after-tax charge at Cessna related to an unfavorable business arbitration award. Also, this year's fourth quarter per share results are based on an average share count of 291.6 million shares, which reflected the repurchase of 11.1 million shares made over the course of the quarter under our 2007 board authorization.", "Moving to cash flow. Fourth quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $625 million, bringing our full year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to $793 million. Full year pension contributions were $405 million, which reflected an additional contribution of $224 million made during the fourth quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Despite weakness in our automotive and business jet markets, we grew manufacturing revenues in the quarter as a result of strong military and commercial demand at Bell along with increased deliveries at Textron Systems, E-Z-GO and Jacobsen. Operationally, results were excellent at Bell and in line with our expectations elsewhere. Obviously, we had a couple of disappointments in the quarter with respect to the arbitration charge at Cessna and in other issues that emerged at our fee-for-service UAS program at Systems.", "While we've made good progress with the training and interior operational deficiencies we discussed during our third quarter call, we have experienced some aircraft engine performance issues in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a pretax charge of $19 million. We believe we've identified the underlying causes that are affecting engine performance and have committed the resources necessary to address these issues.", "Looking forward with these charges we've taken, we now assume both of these programs in ISR Services will generate 0 profit for 2013.", "Positive news at Systems in the quarter was that we had better overall delivery performance resulting in record quarterly revenues and significant deliveries for Shadow retrofit units and Senzor Fuzed Weapons. Therefore, as we look to 2013, we see a return to top line growth and a significant improvement in margins led by growth in UAS revenues, primarily from delivery of TCDL systems.", "Switching to Industrial. As expected, we saw volume soften in the fourth quarter at Caltex as a result of both European and Chinese automotive markets. Greenlee was essentially flat while E-Z-GO and Jacobsen both saw good growth, reflecting new product introductions and ongoing efforts to expand our distribution channels for customers. For the year, we posted a 10 basis point improvement in margins at Industrial on 4% revenue growth.", "Looking at 2013. With continuing uncertainty in European markets, we're taking a conservative view and expect a slight increase in revenue and margins.", "Moving to our Finance segment. The fourth quarter capped a 4-year effort to liquidate our noncap to Finance business. During the quarter, we reduced our total Finance receivables by another $65 million, bringing our 2012 liquidations to $820 million and our 4-year total to $8.7 billion. That leaves only $370 million in noncap to receivables, which we will continue to reduce opportunistically.", "This is the last call in which we will plan to highlight receivable liquidations as the size of our noncap to portfolio is now essentially immaterial.", "Moving now to Cessna. With the U.S. presidential election and fiscal uncertainty intensifying this -- during the quarter, we saw an unusually slow business jet demand, resulting in 53 jet deliveries, down from last year's 67. In total for the year, we delivered 181 jets versus 183 last year, again reflecting that economic and political volatility that developed during the second half of the year.", "Looking toward 2013. We're planning on deliveries to be modestly higher than 2012, although we do expect a back end-loaded profile. This is essentially the result of our new model rollout plan this year with new Sovereign first delivering in the third quarter and the M2 and new Ten in the fourth quarter. We also believe we'll see a degree of uncertainty in the jet market as Washington works through its fiscal challenges, but we believe demand will solidify as those uncertainties are reduced.", "On the aftermarket front, we acquired 2 European service centers, one in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland and one in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, bringing our own global owned service center footprint to 15 facilities. We also signed 2 joint venture agreements in the quarter with our Chinese partners for final assembly and sales activity in China for the Caravan and the XLS plus as we continue to believe that China represents a significant growth market for our Cessna product family.", "Longer term, we're still expecting overall jet growth to develop as global economies gain momentum, emerging markets develop further and our new products roll into the market.", "Wrapping up our operations review with Bell. Execution across programs continue to be outstanding and which reflected our strong margins in the quarter. We delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s and 65 commercial helicopters versus 7 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 62 commercial helicopters in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered 39 V-22s and 24 H-1s, compared to 34 and 25 last year.", "During the quarter, we received an undefinitized V-22 contract for lot 17 and long-lead funding for lot 18, which we're hopeful will lead to the signing of a second multiyear procurement contract once the DoD receives authorization to approve new multiyear contracts. We also continue to actively pursue FMS opportunities for both the V-22 and the H-1.", "On the commercial front, for the full year, we delivered 188 helicopters, up 50% from last year's 125 units, reflecting our investment in new products and increased focus on the commercial helicopter market. For example, we just received an order for 5 429 helicopters from the Turkish Forestry Department, which follows on the Turkish order placed in December of 2001 for 15 429s for their national police force.", "The 429 also continues to receive regulatory approvals for additional 500 pounds of lift capability, bringing total certification to 14 countries including Canada, Brazil, China, and most recently, Chile.", "The new 407GX is also selling very well with the recent order for 20 units from Air Methods.", "Demand is also solid for our 412EP with contracts recently signed with the Colombian Navy and oil production transport companies in Mexico and Egypt.", "Looking to 2013, based on our commercial backlog and an active order pipeline, we expect a solid increase in commercial deliveries once again.", "In summary, despite continued volatility in the global economic environment, I think we had a solid year.", "Our business units: Textron Systems had a number of important program wins, including the Canadian TAPV contract, 2 UAS service contracts and the Navy Ship-to-Shore development program.", "At Industrial, last year's 4% top line growth reflected our continuing investment in new products and distribution.", "Cessna improved margins, expanded its service footprint with new service centers, initiated our China growth strategy, announced the new Citation Sovereign and expanded their product launch family with the new long-range Citation Longitude.", "Bell achieved record full year performance, announced the new 525 Relentless super-medium helicopter, won the #1 customer service rating for the 18th year in a row and opened a new joint service facility with Cessna in Singapore.", "At the Textron level, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we liquidated most of the remaining portion of our non-captive to portfolio while generating nearly $800 million in cash for our manufacturing operations. Consequently, we reduced our consolidated net debt by $974 million to $2.6 billion even after making discretionary contributions into our pension plan. We also returned $272 million to investors through repurchased shares during the fourth quarter.", "Yesterday, our board approved a new $25 million share repurchase authorization under which we intend to purchase shares to offset the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation and benefit plans, as well as for opportunistic capital management purposes.", "To wrap up with our 2013 guidance. We're projecting an overall revenue increase of about 6% and EPS from continuing operations in a range of $2.10 to $2.30.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be $500 million to $550 million, reflecting a significant increase in expected cash income taxes.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Manufacturing revenue was up $85 million in the quarter, generating an increase in manufacturing segment profit of $11 million.", "Let's look at how each of the manufacturing segments contributed, starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were $901 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $110 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting a 21% decline in new jet deliveries, which more than offset a 12% increase in aftermarket revenues. We posted an operating profit of $23 million, down $37 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting the $27.4 million in pretax arbitration charge and lower deliveries.", "At Bell, revenues were up $139 million, primarily due to higher volumes. Segment profit increased $10 million on a higher volume and mix.", "At Textron Systems, revenues increased $58 million, primarily due to higher UAS and SFW volumes, partially offset by lower ASV deliveries. Segment profit increased $44 million, reflecting charges of $60 million in last year's fourth quarter and the higher volumes this year, which were partially offset by this year's $19 million charge.", "Industrial revenues were essentially flat while segment profits decreased $6 million due to cost inflation in excess of price increases.", "Moving to the Finance segment. Credit quality continued to improve with 60-day delinquencies of $90 million, $24 million lower than at the end of last quarter. Non-accrual accounts were $143 million, down slightly from $145 million at the end of the third quarter. The Finance segment reported a profit of $2 million, which reflects earnings in the captive business and a break-even results in the non-captive portfolio.", "Moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $43 million, up from the $39 million last year, primarily due to the impact that higher share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was $38 million, up $11 million from a year ago, primarily as a result of $7 million in interest income booked in last year's fourth quarter associated with the collection on an asset sale.", "Our tax rate at 27% benefited from the impact of foreign taxes. 2012 results do not include the benefit of recently extended R&D tax credit as that will be recorded in the first quarter of 2013.", "Turning now to our 2013 guidance, beginning with pension expense and looking at Slide 9. We're reducing our discount rate assumption, which results in an increase of just over $50 million in 2013 pension costs.", "Turning to Slide 10. We're planning an increase -- to net increase R&D expense -- our spending to approximately $515 million or 4% of sales. We also plan to increase our CapEx this year to about $550 million compared to $480 million last year. These investments support our new product development and cost improvement strategies.", "Now flipping to Slide 11. Here is a summary of 2013 segment guidance. We're expecting about 9% revenue growth at Cessna, reflecting growth in jets and aftermarket with segment margins in the 4% range. At Bell, we expect overall revenues to grow approximately 5%, reflecting a modest increase in our military revenues and good growth in the commercial side of the business. We're expecting margin headwinds at Bell this year, primarily due to lower military margins as well as slightly higher spending on R&D and S&A, resulting in a margin range outlook of 13% to 14%.  At Systems, we're looking for top line growth of about 9%, led by growth in the UAS revenues with segment margins in the range of 9% to 10%. As Scott mentioned, we're expecting revenues and margins to be up slightly at Industrial, reflecting continued softness in Europe, offset by growth in other regions. At Finance, we expect that captive business will generate profit in the range of $10 million to $15 million in 2013, while our non-captive portfolio is expected to approximately break even.", "Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12. We're projecting about $160 million of corporate expense, which primarily reflects the impact of an assumed higher share price.", "Our interest expense estimate, at about $115 million, is down primarily as a result of scheduled debt retirements, most notably our convertible notes, which mature in May.", "We're expecting a decrease in our tax rate to about 29%, primarily reflecting the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit extension. We're estimating that credit will provide a total benefit of approximately $22 million in 2013.", "Looking at Slide 13. We're assuming an average 2013 share count of about 281 million shares, which reflects the share buybacks we made during the fourth quarter, the expected retirement of our convertible bonds and associated collar on May 1, and share repurchases in 2013 sufficient to offset dilution from share-based compensation and benefit programs.", "With respect to our EPS guidance, take a look at Slide 14, which explains the $0.23 change from our 2012 results of $1.97 to the $2.20 midpoint of our 2013 guidance range. First, there is a headwind of $0.12 due to lower earnings at Finance; the increase in pension costs is $0.11 per share; R&D and depreciation represents a headwind of $0.05; lower interest expense provides a pickup of $0.06; and projected tax rate provides a benefit of $0.07; and the lower share count adds about $0.10. Therefore, we expect our underlying manufacturing business to generate an approximate $0.28 increase in EPS.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Steven, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Peter Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions, I guess, on Cessna. Scott, are you thinking that for the first half of next year maybe deliveries could be down year-over-year just because of what you mentioned, the lateness of the new model deliveries?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I do. I mean, I think, Peter, if you think about the year as being up slightly and obviously last year the first half of the year was probably stronger than normal, the second half of the year was weaker than normal, I would expect more or less the inverse of that this year, in part driven by the fact that all those new models are second half-loaded.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Got you, got you. Okay. And then can you give us a sense -- I know trade-ins are becoming such a bigger part of the business. Can you give us a sense of the revenue of trade-ins in 2012 and maybe how you see that going forward?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I don't know if I'll do the exact number, but yes, trade-in sales were up on the -- well, particularly, on the quarter. And I think, generally, they will continue to be up. We have seen a fair bit of trade-in activity, Peter. A lot of that is driven by people that are placing orders and buying aircraft on relatively short cycle and they do need to monetize their existing aircraft for those folks that have aircraft. So we have been taking a higher ratio in terms of number of trades than we normally would. I'd say the good news is the aftermarket, used aircraft market, is doing okay. It's moving pretty well. So most aircraft that we're taking in, we're turning them over in sort of that 1- to 6-month time frame and I would expect to continue to see that. So there will be higher churn of used aircraft going through our book, but I think that, again, the market is doing fine and we are able to turn those aircraft around.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, very good, very good. And then in terms of your guidance next year at Cessna, you talked about modest unit delivery increases, but it looks like about a 10% revenue increase. Is that just continued aftermarket strength as well as maybe a little bit of a mix shift to the higher price point models?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It is. I think you're going to see sort of low double digit on the aftermarket side and slight gains in both the new aircraft, as well as probably an increase, sort of reasonably strong increase in the used aircraft market.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question is on the cash flow outlook. Scott, you noted that the higher cash taxes are taking a big bite. Could you just give it a little bit more context as to is this the year that we get to sort of -- to become a full taxpayer on a cash basis? And any other items that are -- that we should think about in terms of the bridge from 2012 to 2013 cash flow?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, that's really the primary driver, so you're right. I mean, I think that we certainly feel we'll be paying our fair share this year in cash taxes. And that's really been just timing associated with other things over the last few years, so we have not paid as much cash tax. That certainly catches up with us this year. We're talking about used aircraft. I do think that we will see some positive cash flow as we work some of the used aircraft balances down. But other than that, it should be relatively straight conversion of NOP [ph] into cash. Obviously, as Frank said, we will have some higher CapEx spending this year. And again, that's primarily driven by a number of new product programs that are going on, particularly at Bell and Cessna, and as a result of some facilities capital that we're spending with Bell as we consolidate what was multiple facilities in the Fort Worth area into principally one location.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. You noted that your new models, your 3 more new models -- or 1 new model with 2 updates are important to your forecast this year. Can you speak to how those -- how they're tracking, particularly the M2? I was thinking that might be delivered in Q3. It sounds like Q4. So is that slipping, or is everything on track there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, first of all, the programs are going extremely well. Flight test activity is underway with all the aircraft. We have not run into any issues, so we're pleased with the performance and how they're doing. Of course, we do have to go through the FAA certification process. That seems to be tracking reasonably well at this point. The M2 is one that we'd like to get some third quarter deliveries, but I think the way the certification date is going to fall, that's going to be difficult to do. So I think that most, if not all, will be in the fourth quarter. But again, the program and the product has been well received and it's not having any impact in terms of our expectations for the number of units that we'll ship in 2013.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, could you just expound a little bit about upon the Systems and the UAS issue? And I guess, specifically, is this a continuation of what we saw last quarter or are these discrete and new issues that popped up?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, it's a good question. I mean, the issues that we initially ran into on the Services contract were with respect to our ability to get people trained to the appropriate level to be ready for the increase -- basically, just the ramp of the program in terms of people going in theater and operating the aircraft. We put a very robust training process in place and we have not seen any continuation of that. In fact, the off tempo has gone up significantly both at -- or in the UAS program, as well as our ISR program, so for both customers. And the good news is on the second program, on the ISR Services side, we didn't see any training-related issues because we had learned from the initial launch on the MEUAS program the training programs have been effective and worked, and as a result, we seem to be in good shape even as we added a significant number of resources for ramping those programs up. What's new, unfortunately, is that as we started to fly on the first Services contract, we have run into what I believe is a number of different issues associated with the propulsion system on that aircraft. And so we were losing more aircraft than we had in our plan. We have engaged our folks from Lycoming, obviously, who are experts. They've been doing a lot of testing and evaluation. We believe we understand the critical issues that were resulting in the early failures of these propulsion systems. We have been able to implement a number of fixes already. The good news is that we are seeing improved performance in the field in terms of the MEUAS program. We are not seeing those problems with our second customer, again as a result of things that we have learned on the first program. But at this stage of the game, we don't have enough hours really logged on the second program, so when we think about estimating our cost to complete, we really have to look at the total of the combined programs. So obviously, we're disappointed. We did not anticipate having these kind of problems associated with the engines. We've taken significant charges as a result of that, but I do think we're seeing progress in terms of our ability to understand exactly what were those problems and put fixes in place that appear to be having an impact in the field.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just on your Cessna sort of outlook. I mean, your -- if I look at the guidance, I mean, the incremental margins in Cessna have been running at around about 19% to sort of 20% in the last 2 years. I guess, your guidance implies it stays around that level in 2013. I just wondered if you felt there may be some more volume leverage given you're in the fairly early part of the recovery and whether that incremental margin is conservative, or is it the fact that you think that earnings will be extremely weak in the first half and that's why the incremental margins for the year as a whole are only going to be maybe 18%, 19% on your guidance?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think, Julian, part of what you're seeing is there an increase next year in used aircraft as part of that revenue. And sort of by design, the way we typically bring those aircraft in and how we book them, those are typically sales at 0 margins. So that obviously has a dilutive impact on the overall margin rate. That's principally what guides that number to sort of net out around that 20% -- 19% kind of range.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And what sort of pricing trend in Cessna does the guidance embed?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Flat.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then lastly, just on the Systems business. If we think about the guide for '13, you're implying a sort of 30%-or-so incremental margin. How much of that is just coming from normalization following the charges in '12 and how much you're assuming sort of underlying business gets a little bit better on margins?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So I think, Julian, if you -- the way to think about the business is we had guided last year that '12 margins would have been in sort of that 9.5% to 10.5% kind of a range. If you take out these charges, unfortunately, with our Services contract, that's really where we were. And I think if you look at next year, the reason we guide more in that 9% to 10% range is because we have the revenue associated with those programs basically at 0 margins. So I think the margin performance on the balance of the business is where we expect it to be and would have been consistent with this year's guidance. The reason you see a slight decrement to that in terms of our '13 guide is because you do have the revenue associated with those Services contracts and they're 0.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Scott, the Cessna backlog is down again sequentially. I know you guys have discussed how Cessna has shifted from a backlog business to a shorter-cycle business. But presumably, this backlog can't go to 0 and it become just an inter-quarter sales business. So how much lower can backlog go before you have to lower production? And you sort of alluded to it in your prepared remarks, but what's embedded in your 2013 production in terms of how you think orders will compare to production throughout the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, look, Noah, we would certainly like to see some backlog start to build, obviously, as we introduce and get closer to the launches of things like Latitude and Longitude, we would expect to see some build in that area. We announced the new Sovereign relatively late in the year, obviously, and not in a great environment in terms of what was going on in the economy. But I would expect to see a start to build some order book of the new Sovereigns. But the bottom line is, I don't think people should be terribly surprised. I mean, the fourth quarter -- frankly, the second half of the year was not particularly strong in the business jet market. That being said, there's no reason to believe that there's going to be a -- that's not going to normalize and we're going to get back to sort of where we felt in the beginning part of 2012. With respect to production rates, again, we look at this on a very regular basis and anticipate what the order flow is going to look like based on what's going on with customer activity, and that is what is setting our production schedules as opposed to looking at backlog. This is a classic example. If you look into 2013, we're guiding to what we believe will be a modest increase in a number of jets. Obviously, that's based on what we see going on in the market, what our anticipation is in terms of order flow. It takes into consideration, though, as we set production rates, how many aircraft went from '12 to '13. As you know, we've been trying to make sure that we're forecasting this very accurately. There's no question that we would have expected higher sales in both the third and fourth quarter than what we actually saw and we've adjusted our production rates in 2013 accordingly. But we still believe, if you look at the market, you see what's going on with customer activity, where we believe the cycle is, that we still think it's appropriate to build towards a modest increase in deliveries in 2013.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so that's helpful. And can I interpret that to mean we should expect Cessna backlog to continue to decline in the first half and then potentially start to build in the second half given everything you just said?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, no. Look, we're guessing it, obviously, right? So, yes, I think as we get closer to making deliveries in having the availability of the new Sovereigns that I would expect to see some order book built for that product. We have a limited number of Sovereigns to sell here in the next few months because we've stopped production of the Sovereigns, right? There's only a few aircraft that are left, frankly. So as we start to talk customers about Sovereigns, they're all going to be moving into aircraft that are not going to be available for delivery until third quarter.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And if I can ask one more, if I'm looking at your Slide 11, the segment revenue and margin outlook. If you had to identify the one number on here that has the most upside potential and the one number on here you're the most concerned with to the downside, what would those be?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, yes, I'm always most concerned about Cessna just because the sensitivity around what's going on in the market. We don't have a whole lot of control over what the market is doing. And as you know, the backlog, it's not something we're  -- we can just ride the backlog. It does depend on orders and conversion to sales. So that's, I would say, probably the highest risk item. But as you guys know, we have, over the last year few years, tended to over-perform at Bell. I'm sure people will think that there's over-performance opportunity at Bell. I think we can probably push Bell towards the top of the range. But we are going to have -- we're stopping the ramp here, right? So the ramp on the V-22s and the H-1s is kind of coming to its conclusion, so I don't see a lot of leverage on increased volume and we are seeing continued growth on the commercial side of the business. And how that mix plays out will largely impact, I think, what opportunity we would have to outperform on the Bell side.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "I just wondered if we can just delve a little further into Cessna margins in the quarter. Was there any particular or unusual items with used aircraft gains or other adjustments, or was that a good representation of what was going on just operationally in the business?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think it's pretty representative of what was going on operationally in the business. There was a little bit higher sales in terms of used aircraft on a year-over-year basis, but not a huge number. And obviously, the thing that really impacted us the most, Jeff, was the arbitration settlement at $27 million. So you put that back in there, I mean, I think what the team has done, frankly, as I said, obviously, we had lower revenue, lower jet -- new jet deliveries than we would have expected. And I think what you're seeing is the team's doing a nice job on costs. They're doing a nice job on efficiencies within the business. And we moved some volume through there. I think the guys are ready to make it a much more profitable business.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Yes, that's certainly my point. I mean, revenues were down $200 million and you got a high mix of Mustangs and basically held margins flat year-over-year, plus or minus a few basis points. Is there something to read into the Mustang strength? If you look at the historical relationship between business jets and profits, it has broken down, where certainly the lead lag is extended relative to prior cycles. Is there something going on to read into Mustangs being actually reasonably decent and maybe strong here in terms of just the lower end of the market actually firming up?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Jeff, it's difficult to say. I mean, I really -- to be honest with you, as we go from quarter-to-quarter, it seems we see moments in time where the lower end of the market, be it Mustangs or CJs, seems like there's more inquiry and more demand. And then we have quarters where it seems to be more on the Sovereigns and the XLS side. So I think the market is still a little bit skittish, so I don't know that I would look at one or the other. It really does seem to swing as we go through the year. It's peculiar that we seem to see spikes in interest in different sizes and different classes of aircraft, but I can't say that I've been able to figure out how to correlate that to anything.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Yes. And then just on kind of the whole production question, back to that. You finished the year strong on cash flow. It does look like inventory did not decline as much sequentially as it typically does. Is there a dozen or so whitetails, or maybe they're greentails, maybe they're in whip or something, but is there a little bit of backup in the system to think about as we move into the first quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, there is. I mean, without a doubt, we would have expected more fourth quarter sales at Cessna and those aircraft, which really are sort of the greentail. I mean, obviously, as we are working around customers, we focus our completion center activity around the demand that is there. But there's no question, there's more inventory tied up in that -- that latter stages of whip and going into the completion center than we would have expected. We always have had these discussions around the fact that we are building to a forecast and that's what we're going to continue to do. We've, generally speaking, been about where we expected. There's no doubt we were light in terms of sales activity in the fourth quarter. But again, it does take a bit of a hit on the inventory side, but these are perfectly good aircraft. And obviously, we're selling them as we speak. So it's more of an issue of looking forward and adjusting what we need to do in terms of 2013 production to accommodate the fact that we did have more whip that rolled from '12 into '13.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And just a quick one, for Frank, if you have the number. What -- where did you end up on just your final pension funded status for the year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, we're at a deficit of about $1.3 billion. So the obligation is about $7 billion and the assets at $5.7 billion or so.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Scott, you mentioned that the pricing assumption for this year at Cessna is flat. Can you let us know whether that represents an improvement relative to what you saw in all of 2012, and particularly, the fourth quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'd say that price has been relatively flat. We've seen some models better than others. I would say, frankly, in the fourth quarter, we certainly had some opportunities to sell some aircraft that would have reflected some significant downward pricing. I mean, people are trying to play that game. And I think our decision was we're going to walk away from some of that. So part of the behavior here in terms of pricing, I think, does have to get out of trying to move aircraft and that's behavior we're trying to see. So there's no question there were few aircraft that could have resulted in negative pricing in the quarter that we're just not going to do. So but I'd say, generally speaking, it has been flattish. And as we said earlier, that's kind of how we're thinking about it in terms of how we guide into next year.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "The map on this is -- Jason, the map on this is a little bit not straightforward because we got the new Sovereign coming in and the M2. So how you kind of look at that versus last year becomes definitional. But we'll expect better pricing on those 2 relative to what's been happening generically otherwise.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, I agree. No, it is helpful to look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, I hear you. And then, Frank, in your prepared remarks, and maybe it was in response to a question, you suggested that there was some cost inflation in the Industrial division that hurt margins on a year-on-year basis. Do you have any numbers to back that up or you could provide to us? And then can you describe the types of things which you're doing to help offset any of those types of headwinds?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. I mean, it was really year-over-year on a quarterly basis. And what -- we typically do see some kind of inflationary headwind relative to price, particularly the Caltex business, and we look to offset that with performance. And so that can kind of jump around quarter-to-quarter. We also, under our Caltex contracts, recover some elements of cost inflation, but there can be a lag to doing that. And so we do get some quarterly fluctuation in that and so we just had some fourth quarter fluctuation. But generally, between kind of performance and price, we're able to offset the inflation and that's what you'd see if you look at the full-year results for Industrial. And then for the quarter, it was between $6 million and $7 million, yes, but it was not a big number.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, on the Cessna front, you mentioned that you've been getting things done on the used market. I was wondering if you've been seeing any improvement over the last 3 months in the used pricing or the used fleet that's out there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, we have seen better deals on pricing in the used market, so -- and I think that, that just in terms of publicly available data that's out there, I think it would corroborate that people are seeing a little bit of an uptick in used aircraft market. It's not overwhelming.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. And what about the fleet for sale, has that changed at all?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's continuing to marginally drop, not a huge change, though.", "Frank T. Connor", "It's around 12%. And we're just -- I mean, we continue to see very good turnover.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "As I said earlier, most of aircraft that we're bringing in, in a 1- to 6-month cycle, we're moving them back out. So from our perspective, obviously, the rate of turn to move these things is what's most important because we are, basically, providing a service to our customer to modify that aircraft, allow them to get a new aircraft, and then we want to move that aircraft on.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right. And then at Bell, you mentioned about V-22, you've had some success in signing up further lots. But it looks like the multiyear has slipped out. If the sequester kicks in, does that impact the ability of the Marine Corps to sign up to this multiyear? And at what point would you start to get concerned if it doesn't get signed?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the issue with the multiyear is that as long as we're operating under a CR, they do not have authority to sign multiyear contracts. There was actually an attempt in -- to put that in and make an exemption so that you could do multiyear and that did not go through. So they had no authority to sign any multiyear contracts, be it our programs or any other programs. So it really has to do with getting legislation passed that actually gives them a budget and gives them budget authority to do multiyear contracts.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "But in terms of your timing, if we were still here in the middle of the year, would you start to have problems with long lead items?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No. So what they've done is, they've gone ahead and awarded an undefinitized contract for lot 17, which would be the first lot of the next multiyear, as well as the long lead material procurement for lot 18, which would be the second year of the multiyear. So because they do have authority under the CR to award individual contracts on a year-over-year basis, they are continuing to do that. So what you're seeing with the award of lot 17 and the award of long lead material under lot 18 is on schedule and gives us the ability to deliver to what the multiyear plan would be. But just because of their contracting authority, they can only do it on a year-by-year basis.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right. And are the terms on that comparable to what you've got on your current multiyear?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, there was a price negotiation that was undertaken and is concluded with respect to the next multiyear. Certainly, the margins, as part of that negotiation, have been reduced as you would expect normally happens when you've driven a lot of productivity and you end up with another contract. The issue, of course, is with a multiyear deal now, it's incumbent upon us to go try to figure out how you get those margins back to where they were.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Scott, I wanted to -- at Bell, the guidance to 13% to 14% margin where you almost did 15% in '12 and you're one year closer to the end of the current multiyear with the V-22, you think you'd get a margin pickup, are you being conservative or is the mix between commercial going to be that much higher that you're figuring there's a lower margin? And if you could just go through what was your commercial book-to-bill in '12 and kind of what are you looking for in '13?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, on the military side in terms of delivery, George, it's going to be relatively flat on the V-22 and H-1 front, and it is increasing. Again, we think we'll see another year of solid growth in terms of increases in the number of commercial deliveries. Also, as I said, as we increase our R&D spending and we stop having the leverage on the military side of increasing those numbers, our costs are somewhat higher in terms of what's embedded in overhead rates, and therefore, that is putting some pressure even on the military margin rates on a year-over-year basis.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then one on Textron Systems. I mean, where is the growth actually coming from? I mean, it looks your guidance are like a little over 9%, up year-over-year, and in military business that most people will be down 5% on average. And the margin there, it seemed a little aggressive to me given that the growth is probably coming from the TAPV, some of the 0 -- low to 0 margin programs. So just wondering where you're getting the profit guidance there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, we expect to see increased deliveries in a number of areas in our UAV business and our -- I would expect to see some increased revenue in our Sensor Fuzed Weapon business. The TAPV and the Ship-to-Shore which, of course, are still in the early stages and the development phases do not contribute a lot of revenue in terms of deliveries in 2013. So it's really the core parts of SFW and the UAV business that we expect to see driving revenue growth.", "George Shapiro", "And then just one on Cessna. Did you see any difference in the bookings after the election versus prior to the election or in January? Have you seen any difference where they did not change the depreciation rules so there wasn't any adverse impact on general aviation?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, George, unfortunately, we were hoping to see a bit of an uptick after the election got behind us. I would say that didn't happen and from -- at least from our perspective, and certainly talking to our customers. All the stuff that was going on with the so-called fiscal cliff, most people chose to sort of wait that out, and so they did. So the normal -- I mean, frankly, the number of customers that we have sort of in the discussion phase all look very normal. The amount of activity going on are all very normal. But the mess that happened as we went through December, I think -- November, December, just led people to say they'd stand back. So we have seen delivery. We have seen orders obviously here as we've gone into the beginning of the year. I'd say we probably have had more order activities than we're used to seeing right at the beginning of January, but I would say that's probably a result of people waiting out to see what was going to happen. Remember, they didn't come to a conclusion and decide at least what they were going -- what little they were going to do on the fiscal cliff until beginning of January. So that, clearly, was a problem.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. But the fact that the tax laws were effectively not changed for general aviation, did that provide a little bit of a trigger here, you think, in terms of your comment that you're seeing a little better order activity here in early part of January?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "George, I always think the bonus depreciation is sort of beneficial, but on the fringe, right? It's not going to cause somebody to buy an aircraft or to upgrade their aircraft. I mean, you've always been looking at a 5-year depreciation schedule here. So whether you're doing 20% a year over a 5-year period or whether you get half in year 1, it's not a huge issue. So if people have room in tax, we've seen that drive their behavior. As you know, we always tend to see a stronger fourth quarter because people have always wanted to get that first year depreciation in the current tax year, and so that's always driven some cyclicality into this business. But the difference between 50%, 20%, yes, beneficial, but I still believe sort of on the margins. People don't buy an aircraft because of tax depreciation in terms of bonus.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Quick -- a couple of quick clarifications and then a question. Just briefly on the Cessna margin for next year, if we -- obviously, we add back the arbitration charge from the quarter, you'll be for this year close to the low end of where the guidance is for next year. And as you sort of go through the headwinds and tailwinds for next year, it would seem that used aircraft will be a headwind, R&D is potentially a headwind, mix is potentially a headwind, but volume is your tailwind. Is there any -- are there any other tailwinds there other than just improved performance out of the team that you're looking to, to see the margins come in a little bit better?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, I think you've capped it pretty well. Mix is relatively neutral. We continue -- I think if we look at our forecast for the year, the mix won't help or hurt a whole lot. Obviously, some new models coming in is beneficial to us, particularly with the Sovereign block point in the latter half of the year. So the headwinds really are increased used, which does not carry much volume or margin with it, a little bit of R&D headwind. But primarily, this is going to be how does the team do operationally. And again, I think our momentum going into the year is good. The activities that Scott and the team have been driving in terms of operational efficiencies are working. And we get some additional volume, obviously, that will be a good leverage.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And presumably, aftermarket is a bit of a mix benefit as well, so...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, it is. And I think we'll see, again, solid growth in the aftermarket.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. With respect to Bell and the margin in Q4, was there anything to note in terms of cumulative catch-up that benefited the margin to speak of?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, there's always some cume catch in terms of the program. You see accounting in the quarter. I think in terms of year-over-year, we had a pretty tough comp. We have very good mix of commercial aircraft in the fourth quarter a year ago. We probably did not have as good a mix in terms of the types of commercial aircraft that shipped in the fourth quarter this year. But overall, over the span of the year, obviously it was a very good year on the commercial side, and I think we'll see that momentum continue into '13.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And lastly, on the repurchases and the outlook for that for next year or for 2013. I wondered if you might share some detail on the decision, repurchases versus dividends, and why you chose what you chose in terms of opportunistic capital deployment on repurchases instead of maybe upping the dividend?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, there's a couple of things going on. Obviously, one, which we mentioned, is we feel like it's appropriate to be offsetting the dilution associated with the employee compensation and benefit plans, the 401(k) matching and things of that nature, and so that accounts for us somewhere in the neighborhood of a few million shares a year. And so that's one thing that we want to make sure that we offset. In terms of summer activity this year, we know we have a convertible coming up here in May and we want to try to be offsetting some of the dilution associated with the retirement of that instrument. And in terms of going forward again, we'll continue -- as a minimum on the anti-dilutive offsets and based on our perspective in terms of the company and where stock is, what do we think is in the best interest of the shareholder. And I think at this stage in the game, our conclusion was allocating some of that cash to retiring some of the shares is probably the most share-enhancing strategy in terms of capital deployment right now.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Last year, on the fourth quarter call, you projected R&D in 2012 at $590 million. You just reported net R&D of $504 million. So what's the difference between R&D and net R&D? And on a net basis, what did the R&D do in 2012, and where was it up if it was up?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So, Cai, so the R&D was up. It was up principally driven in Bell. At Cessna, we were not up as much as we probably originally thought. That's driven primarily by the fact that if you look at our programs and the fact that we were taking Sovereigns basically out of production to bring in the new one, and a number of other changes we made, and particularly around deciding to do the Longitude program, and therefore not a couple of the things that were more shorter-term upgrade programs, we were able to shift a lot of our engineering resource from what would normally be sustaining minor change things into our primary new product programs. So we were able to staff a lot of those major programs without having to increase a lot of our R&D dollars. We would expect the same to continue to next year. So we'll see modest increases in R&D, and again, principally driven by increases at Bell and some increases at Cessna as we ramp up those programs. In terms of this net R&D, we're trying to show what is the true headwind, if you will, from an EPS perspective as opposed to not sort of all engineering as opposed to necessarily the R&D tax credit-type things that benefit or specifically fit the R&D definition. So it's reflective of all our engineering. Because what basically happened, Cai, is we're letting table a lot of our engineering that really is associated with not historically R&D, but a lot more sustaining engineering and instead move those funds and resources into our new product programs.", "Frank T. Connor", "Just to be clear, on the net versus what we called R&D before, they're the same. We just put the word net in there to clarify that it does not include those items that are reimbursed by third parties like the government.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, but, so you reported $504 million. The year before, you reported $484 million. You were going to be up $100 million. You were only up $20 million, is that correct?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "That's right. And that's principally driven, as I said, by the fact that we've been able to take a lot of our other engineering resource, which was not engaged in R&D programs, it was doing sustaining  develop -- sustaining support of our production programs, and moved a lot of that resource into the R&D area.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then as you look at the mix, then, in 2013, you said it would be neutral. But I mean, should we assume, I mean, that Mustangs might be flat to down in the mix? I would assume that M2s will be up plus in the mix, that Sovereigns and the Tens would be up, or is that incorrect because they go toward the end of the year, is that likely not to benefit 2013 that much?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think if you look at it, Cai, so absolutely our view would be that Mustangs will be down. M2s obviously will -- are new. So I think if you look at volumes of what was Mustang in that sort of the lighter end of the market will be made up this year of, instead of just Mustangs, it'll be a combination of Mustangs and M2s. So there's a slight mix shift up there, okay, but then you're talking about $3.2 million aircraft versus $4.5 million aircraft, so in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't change the mix shift very much from the perspective of the overall mix of the business. We will have the Sovereign deliveries, but I think if you look at combined Sovereign and Ten sales last year versus this year, they are relatively equivalent. And then you look at the balance of the portfolio through the CJs and the XLSs, again, it's going to be roughly a similar kind of number. So that's why I say, I don't think you're going to see a huge mix shift in terms of the overall average dollar waiting, if you will, per aircraft in 2013.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "That's very good. But you did mention that the Sovereign and the Ten happen in the second half. So is the fact that the volume is relatively flat, a function of when the deliveries begin, and that, therefore, the market allowing 2014 should be an up year, or is it just that demand is essentially flat?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, so, I mean, we see demand as being relatively flat. Obviously, we'd like to think that 2014 will be an up year, but that's a guidance question for another 364 days from now. But, yes, I mean it really is principally driven by demand at this stage of the game, Cai.", "Operator", "Our next question in queue will come from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a follow-up question on Cessna. Given the back-end load of the deliveries in 2013, I mean, the usual question is will it be profitable in the first quarter. I guess, the question here is, will it be profitable in the first half given 3Q-4Q mix? And then CJ4s, are they a pressure point? Do they come off kind of being a new product? And how much per pressure point, if at all?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think that we would certainly expect to see profitability in the first half of the year. And CJ4, I don't expect -- in fact, I think if we look at year-over-year volumes, look like they're pretty flat on CJ4s. So it's only an aircraft that's been in the market for a few years. It's still doing very well from a competitive standpoint. It's performing -- the performance is outstanding. Customers are very happy with it. So it continues to be, frankly, probably the most from a volume standpoint, probably the most popular aircraft we have in our portfolio right now.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then one follow-up. On aftermarket at Cessna, what was the growth in the quarter? And what's the expectation implied for '13?", "Frank T. Connor", "The Cessna aftermarket was 12% in the quarter, and it's now kind of 10-ish percent for next year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brian Jacoby of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick one on the upcoming debt maturities at both the parent company and PIMCO, what's your plans there? It looks like you could handle it with cash, but, obviously, the markets are pretty attractive from a debt funding perspective.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, the way we think about the balance sheet is that we will handle those with cash. And kind of with that debt pay down, we will have a total debt level that is a level that we think is the right type of level for the business in its current size. And so the intent would be to pay that down and not refinance it.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Steve Levenson of Stifel.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You've answered pretty much all the questions we had. But in terms of the percentage to fleet for sale, can you say about how much is current models and what you don't think is an issue?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'm sorry, I haven't looked at that data. Just recently, it's been -- things have been fairly stable in terms of available for sale. So I think, as Doug said, with the whole fleets around 12% kind of a number, as we look at that data through the course of the year, the models are still in production, relatively recent aircraft has really been more in the low to mid-single digit in terms of percent per sale.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And with the changes at Hawker Beechcraft, are you seeing any change in the market picking up any business, or are those used jets causing an issue?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I guess, we'll have to wait to see all of the gamma numbers here. But I guess, my sense is, in terms of new aircraft, clearly, we feel we've been picking up some share over the course of the year. Part of that, obviously, is Hawker going out of the market and it was a pretty tough year when you have a competitor that's exiting a business line. But I don't think there's lots of aircraft left, so I would expect that not to be much of an issue on a going-forward basis.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from the line of Ronald Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron Epstein. Our question is how many whitetails or greentails do you have at Cessna?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We don't do the greentail or whitetail number specifically. Just in terms of direction, as I said, we clearly would have expected some additional sales in Q4 that we did not see given everything going on. But as I said in the past, we're trying to build or forecast and estimate it as well as we can. The only downside risk if you're off on that number is you take a little bit of inventory risk, and that's exactly what we did and what happened. And those aircraft will obviously sell off here in the very near future.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of today's panel, I'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. Thank you for using AT&T.

Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Textron First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Doug Wilburne, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we'll be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to first quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $2.9 billion, approximately flat with the year ago. Income from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to earnings per share of $0.41 in the first quarter of 2012. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $425 million use of cash. First quarter pension contributions were $140 million.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Manufacturing revenues were up slightly in the quarter based on strong commercial demand of Bell, increased deliveries of Textron Systems and sales growth at E-Z-GO. Unfortunately, demand for business jets was soft again this quarter. We were hopeful that demand would recover as the impact of last year's election and fiscal uncertainties were behind us. We also thought the recent strength in U.S. equity markets would have supported improved business confidence and therefore, business jet demand.", "Sales dialogue and customer recruit was reasonably active during the quarter. However, customers, especially in the light jet segment, who tend to be small business owners, continue to defer purchase decisions, reflecting continued concerns about their financial outlook. As a result, we delivered 32 new jets in the quarter, down from 38 a year ago, resulting in a segment loss in the quarter of $8 million. On the positive side, we continue to see good volume in the used market, leading to a significant increase in used jet sales, which resulted in higher overall Cessna revenue despite lower new deliveries.", "Looking forward, given the lack of recovery in the business jet market, we're reducing our 2013 business jet delivery outlook and now expect that deliveries will be down this year compared to 2012. This reflects our expectations for lower deliveries in the light category, partially offset by growth in the midsized category. Accordingly, we're adjusting our production schedules and implementing other appropriate cost actions at Cessna. In addition, we've initiated a salary workforce reduction program, the largest portion of which is a voluntary separation plan.", "While we are taking these immediate actions, we believe the global business market has significant long-term growth potential, and we remain committed to our new product plans, which include the introduction of the M2 and the new Sovereign and Citation X models later this year, as well as Latitude in 2015 and the Longitude in 2017.", "Moving now to our finance segments. Slowness in the business jet market resulted in only a few new loan originations during the quarter. However, segment profit benefited from good performance in our captive portfolio and a number of small asset transactions in our non-captive business. Shifting to industrial. We saw lower volumes in the quarter at Caltex as growth in North America was more than offset by weakness in both the European and Asian automotive markets. Greenlee and Jacobsen were down slightly, reflecting weakness in European markets, while E-Z-GO saw good growth, reflecting the success of new product introductions. Moving to systems. Revenues were up, reflecting growth in our UAS and weapons and sensor product lines. We continue to see operational improvement in our fee-for-service UAS programs, but as previously discussed, these are essentially break-even programs for us at this time. Finishing with Bell, operational results reflected good program execution in both military and commercial product lines. We did experience a decline in aftermarket deliveries during the quarter. This a result of the conversion to a new ERP system. I would note that the underlying aftermarket order flow actually remained quite strong.", "The global commercial original equipment demand environment also remained strong as we delivered 40 commercial helicopters in the first quarter versus 30 in last year's first quarter. We also had a very good showing at this year's Heli-Expo, announcing 2 new products, the Bell 412 EPI and the Bell 407 GT. The new 412 EPI includes a fully integrated glass flight deck and 1,400-pound increase in maximum hot and high payload capacity. These are significant enhancements to the value of what is already one of Bell's most versatile and reliable helicopters, and the customer response, so far, has been very positive. Likewise, the new Bell 407 GT, which is an armed version of the 407GX, incorporates an integrated glass cockpit and a fully configurable weapon system. We believe the GT will be an effective and affordable platform for foreign military and paramilitary applications.", "We also featured our new Relentless 525 flight simulator at HAI, demonstrating the steady progress we're making toward first flight next year. Overall, we had a very successful show, capped by the signing of 50 new commercial orders, including an agreement with Air Medical Group to deliver 30 helicopters over the next several years. During the quarter, the 429 model continued to add jurisdictions certifying a 500-pound increase in useful load. The most recent came from Indonesia, an important and growing helicopter market, making it the 17th country to approve the increased maximum gross weight.", "In the military business, we delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s in the quarter, consistent with our customers' quarterly delivery schedules but down slightly compared to 10 V-22s and 7 H-1s in last year's first quarter. We are on track to deliver 40 V-22s and 25 H-1s in total this year. We also delivered our 100th H-1, marking an important milestone toward fulfilling the total program record of 349 units. We also delivered the first HMX V-22 units, which will serve presidential and other special missions.", "And finally, at last week's Army Aviation Association of America meeting in Fort Worth, we introduced the V280 Valor as our entry to the Army's request for joint multi-role future vertical lift aircraft. The Valor concept is a third-generation tiltrotor, featuring a fixed engine configuration with a target cruise speed of 280 knots and a combat range of up to 800 nautical miles. We believe this platform will prove to be the highest performance, most cost-effective solution to the Army's future mission requirements.", "To wrap up, despite a challenging first quarter, most of our businesses were on track for a solid year, with the notable exception of Cessna, which necessitated a change in our operational plans and our overall outlook. On this basis, we're reducing our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $1.90 to $2.10. We're also lowering projected cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions to about $400 million as a result of the lower expected Citation deliveries. We remain focused on continuing to improve our operational execution and cost productivity, while, at the same time, we're also committed to continue our investments in new products and sales capabilities to grow the business over the long term.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $235 million, down $24 million from the first quarter of 2012 on approximately flat revenues. Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. At Cessna, revenues were up $39 million from this period last year, primarily the result of $81 million increase in preowned aircraft sales. We also had an $18 million or about 9% increase in aftermarket revenues. The segment had a loss of $8 million compared to a loss of $6 million a year ago. This reflected lower new jet deliveries and pricing, including the impact of selling our 5 remaining legacy Sovereigns and higher pension cost, partially offset by an improvement in mix. Looking to the second quarter, keep in mind that there will be no new Sovereign or X deliveries, and we expect to record costs of about $25 million for the workforce action that Scott discussed.", "At Bell, revenues were down $45 million on decreased V-22 and H-1 deliveries and lower commercial aftermarket sales, partially offset by increased commercial unit sales. Segment profit decreased $16 million from the first quarter in 2012, primarily reflecting the lower overall volumes. At Textron Systems, revenues were up $52 million, reflecting higher UAS and weapons volumes. Segment profit increased $3 million.", "Industrial revenues decreased $28 million, reflecting lower automotive volumes and a $4 million negative foreign exchange impact. Segment profit decreased $16 million, mainly due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix.", "Moving to Finance. Revenues decreased $19 million from last year's first quarter, reflecting lower finance receivables, while segment profit was up $7 million. Credit performance remained relatively steady during the quarter with non-accruals of $147 million and 60-day delinquencies of $80 million.", "Lastly, moving to corporate items. Corporate expenses were $55 million, and we remain on track for our full year forecast of about $160 million. Interest expense was $37 million, up $2 million from a year ago. On the tax line, our rate reflected benefits primarily related to the impact of the reenacted U.S. R&D tax credit. We're still on track for our original full year tax guidance of 29%.", "Moving to our consolidated cash flows, which is the last schedule attached to our press release. We ended the quarter with $791 million in consolidated cash, down $622 million from the end of the fourth quarter. The drawdown in cash in the quarter reflected a net reduction in debt of $236 million; inventory increases, primarily at Bell; $140 million in contributions to our pension plans; slower payments on military contracts; and seasonal incentive compensation payments. During the second quarter, we will retire $250 million principal amount remaining on our convert at the Textron level, and we have $371 million scheduled debt repayments at TFC.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad, we can open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to our first question from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, I was wondering if you'd kick off with Cessna. Last quarter, you commented that there had been a pickup in used activity and also used pricing. Now it seems used activity has continued in Q1. I was wondering if you could clarify how the used pricing has progressed.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Rob, I'd say the pricing has been pretty flat. I mean, the market is -- definitely continued to be strong in terms of the number of transactions. Obviously, you see that in our numbers this quarter, as we've sold a lot of aircraft. I think the market -- the used market in total continues to move. I think that's representative. We've seen a little bit of a tick-down again in terms of used available for sale. But I would say, we still see it as pretty challenged in terms of the pricing itself there in the used market.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, secondly, on Cessna, you said it's going to be down this year in terms of new deliveries. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of just about how much it's going to be down.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, look, I mean, we try to stay away from exact numbers on this, Rob. But I think when you look at how we would guide, we're probably talking about a couple of hundred million dollars or so on the top line. It's mostly in the light jet markets. So I'd say from there, you can kind of probably make reasonable estimations in terms of the number of aircraft that we're talking about cutting back. And that's really kind of our revised forecast, as much as we hate doing this. And by the way, we're still out there selling hard. I mean, we're going to do everything we can do to sell aircraft. We're pretty happy, I think, with the effectiveness of what our sales teams are doing. I think our share feels good. But we just have to be open about the fact that, that light market just hasn't recovered at this point, contrary to our expectations. And so we're going to scale back some of the production and reduce the number of aircraft that are out there in that space because I think the demand just isn't there.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the reduction in the cash flow guidance, which you said was attributable to the lower Citation deliveries. Does that reflect a more sizable cut to your anticipated deliveries versus production? How should we think about the mismatch there and if that's really just inventory that will build up over the course of the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, it just really is inventory. The challenge, obviously, as we sit here at this time of the year, is to make a substantive change to the production schedule on those aircraft. An awful lot of that material is already in-house. Clearly, one of the things that we'll do as we go through the production change is we'll build things out to logical points in their build cycle so those aircraft are sort of in an appropriate stage of work in progress before we shut down various portions of the production line. And that just means we're going to have inventory, clearly, that's going to roll over to the end of the year as opposed to going out in sold aircraft.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And with respect to the Cessna margin in your previous guidance, it looks like the cost actions are worth about 1%, but you've lowered the guidance by $0.20. So if it's all related to Cessna, it sort of implies margins that are closer to breakeven. Is that correct?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's principally related -- almost all of the $0.20 is related to Cessna, that's correct.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Scott, I wondered if you could help me think about backlog. I know we've asked this before, and the discussion is that it's just not as important right now. But first, Cessna specifically. The Cessna backlog was actually more stable in the quarter than it's been in a while. I mean, implied dollar bookings and dollar book-to-bill was as high as it's been in a while. Can you just talk about what the moving pieces were in that backlog and how it's possible that you are kind of okay with production levels while backlog kept coming down and now that it's sort of finally seeing some stabilization that's driving the production level decrease?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Noah, look, we've always -- first of all, if you look at backlog in the quarter, I mean, basically, what it reflects is that we're taking orders and delivering in the same quarter. So there's not a whole lot of stuff going in and out of backlog, right? You're taking an order for an aircraft and you deliver the aircraft, so there's not a whole lot of change going on in the backlog. In terms of...", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "But [indiscernible], right? And the degree to which that happened in the quarter was at least less than it's been over the past several quarters, right?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I mean, that's been the mode that we've been in, right? So, I mean, we have been, obviously, building to a forecast as opposed to building a backlog for the last several years. Our initial intent as we went into this year is, given the dynamics that we saw in the marketplace, that we would start to see stronger demand than we saw in the second half of last year in terms of the lights, and we're just not seeing that manifest. So at this point, I think it's appropriate for us to say we're not seeing that volume, and we just don't see the number of customer discussions going on that we believe are going to come to closure that would justify continuing at that build rate.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, I'm also wondering, is this very specifically Mustang? Because when I look at the deliveries in the quarter that was very light, whereas some of the bigger metal or a lot of the bigger metal was really kind of flat or even up year-over-year. But I know you don't make much money on those and you're lowering the margin outlook so that would imply it's not just Mustang. I know you don't to want to get specific on aircraft, but can you...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, it's okay. I mean, when we talk about the light category, we're talking about Mustang through the CJ4. So -- and look, part of the dynamic is when you look at what's going on in the marketplace, there is obviously tighter pricing here as well, right? I mean, so I think that one of the things that we see that's becoming more and more difficult and sort of more and more difficult here in the first quarter is that in order for transactions to happen, there are expectations of lower and lower price. And I get to a point here where we're not going to play that game anymore, so we're going to take some of the capacity out of what's out there trying to transact because we're not going to do deals at price levels that people seem to think that our level is -- has to be for them to make the transaction happen.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Have some of the aircraft beyond Mustang through CJ4 been a little better than you expected or no?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I don't know that they're better than we would've expected. The XLSs have been doing well. We did sell the last 5 Sovereigns that we had of the pre-block-point-change model. That, of course, is never a particularly strong pricing environment, when you're trying to get that lesser-grade aircraft. But it's -- people know they're buying the last of that model type. So I think that XLS activity was good. And obviously, there's a lot of discussion going on around the block point change for the Sovereign and some orders we're starting to take for that. So again, I -- we really do see -- the market behavior in that medium segment has been more consistent with our expectations, whereas the light side has been weaker. And again, it just seems for transactions to happen it's at a price point that I don't think we want to play.", "Operator", "And we'll go on to the next line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Scott, on Cessna, just one more there. What are your customers telling your sales force exactly as to why activity -- why does your sales team believe that activity did have a slower start to the year than you were expecting a couple of months ago?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Joe, I mean, there's kind of noise all over the place, right? There's -- These are mostly small business guys, so their taxes have gone up. They read all the political nonsense, all this corporate jet loopholes, which, by the way, they mean depreciation, which I'm not sure why that's a loophole since it's actually in the tax code and always has been. You've got this new proposal on user fees, which, I think, is very unlikely that's actually going to go through. But again, it's get thrown on the table, to whack everybody $100 for every flight on top of all their existing operating costs. And people are still a little concerned about where the economy is. So -- and you also have the pressure. It ties back to commentary earlier on the used aircraft pricing. As long as the used aircraft pricing is pretty tough, that means the collateral value of their current aircraft is not as strong as they'd like it to be. So when you look at all those kind of moving pieces, it just -- it kind of leads guys to say, \"I'll wait a little while and/or give me a lower price to help incent me to do it.\" And that's the part of the -- I think it's to say if that's really where the market is, then we'll back off on production and just accept that there's less demand out there in the marketplace.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. On the restructuring actions that you're taking, the $25 million, is that mostly labor or do you have an opportunity to take out other fixed costs besides just labor?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, the $25 million is virtually all related to severance of employee costs and obviously, as a result -- salary cost. And so as a result, that will obviously accrete back over the balance of this year into the beginning of next year in terms of lower payroll.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "There aren't any -- there's no write-offs of equipment or things like that. It's just running at a lower rate.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. And then just finally, on the sequester, could you help size -- it doesn't look like you saw much impact in the quarter, if any. But could you help size, as we think about the Bell military aftermarket, what that business looks like for you right now in terms of size and profitability and what you think -- how you're looking at the rest of the year playing out? And if there's any thoughts on systems along the same lines.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, sir, you're right. I mean, I think, at this point, we're seeing sequestration issues sort of on the margins, if you will. I would expect it in the aftermarket side of Bell. There will be some pressure in that area. And some of it's going to be OPTEMPO related as things continue to wind down and some of the conflicts. Although I don't see that as being a material number or something that would give us any pause in terms of either our guidance this year or frankly, our own -- our internal thoughts in terms of our long-range plans. So yes, some impact here and there, but nothing material. I think on the system side, as we talked before, the issues that -- or the areas I worry about is that we could see a little bit of impact probably around some of our UAS business and some of the programs associated with that because they are year-to-year funded. And I think it's quite conceivable that in some of those programs, there could be a slowdown of deliveries on some of the upgrade programs or refurbishment programs. There can be some things in some of our intelligence software-related businesses, where some of those agencies have taken a bit of a haircut on sequestration, and it wouldn't be surprising to see them scale back accordingly on some of their acquisitions of some of their intelligence software and upgrade products and things like that. So -- but again, I -- we don't have, at this point, any visibility whatsoever that would say that we have a major program that would be impacted by this or cancellation or anything of that nature, so I really do think that at least this year and what visibility we have in those programs as they go into the 2014 timeframe. Will there be some pressures? I think everybody will have some pressures, but they're all sort of on the margins, not a significant or major program cancellation.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jonathan Raviv", "Actually, Jon Raviv in for Jason. A quick question on V-22. I was just wondering, given the recent budget of V-22 was in line, but going longer term, out to '15, what are you thinking in terms of international orders and how that impacts expected volumes when the multiyear resets in 2015.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Okay. So obviously, the current multiyear is unaffected. The next, multiyear 2 [ph], which have been negotiated, it's now in the process, now the government has authority to go ahead and enter into that contract. That's working its way through the process and should be done here, I would guess, within the next 30 days or so. It goes through the normal congressional notification, and there's just timelines associated with that. But I think that will be signed here shortly. In terms of foreign opportunities, there has been no change in that regard. We have a couple of customers that are already in, I would say, detailed discussions with respect to buying V-22s. Those discussions continue to progress quite well. I wouldn't expect to see any kind of a formal announcement until you get to the point where this is something that's going to be notified to Congress. I mean, these will be FMS transactions, obviously, so they have to go through that process. But in terms of anything that's going on from a budgetary standpoint, we haven't seen any impact to bring in those deals to conclusion.", "Jonathan Raviv", "And then just in terms of volume in 2015, what are the sort of pluses and minuses in terms of where we might go to from like 40 [ph] this year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the 2015 number is unchanged and I wouldn't...", "Frank T. Connor", "24.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, it's 24, and I wouldn't expect that, frankly, at this stage, to be changed by one of these Foreign Military Sales opportunities. It's just we're getting too close to the timeline in terms of production volumes to make any kind of a material change to that. I do think it's possible in one or maybe even both cases of the deals that are sort of in the works that it's possible that our customer may allocate a couple of those aircraft to start the initial deliveries with a foreign customer. But it's too soon really to know. But I think that I would not expect to see much change to that number of 24 in 2015. So in the FMS volumes, once we get under contract, would really be added onto the volumes in the -- probably the '16, '17 timeframe.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Scott, I wanted to pursue one more with Cessna. When you announced on April 2 that you were going to have a reduction in indirect people at Cessna, you made a comment production rates are unchanged. And now 2 weeks later, they're coming down. I was just wondering if anything happened significantly in the last 2 weeks to have that change.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Look, George, I would say that the conversations that Scott and I had, which, frankly, go back into March around what was going on in the business, what we were looking at in terms of market recovery and such that we really probably need to take another look at the underlying cost in the business, okay? Because even at that time, we're expecting 2012 -- '13 to be kind of flat to '12, okay? So it's not like there was an expectation of a big recovery, and we decided that we needed to take some cost out of the business to give ourselves some headroom. We don't like coming in to every quarter -- and at that time, we're trying to figure out, \"Okay, are we going to make money? Are we not going to make money?\" We decided to do some resizing of the business to make sure that even in the event of 38 jets, we made sure that we had a profitable business. And so the decision was taken at that time to do a voluntary reduction program. We have an awful lot of stuff going on at Cessna, as you guys know, right? We have a lot of new product programs. We have a lot of people working hard to do a lot of good things, and we are trying to balance getting some cost out of the business without, frankly, putting the business through a very traumatic time. And we've already gone through an awful lot of layoffs and reductions at Cessna over the last years. So we concluded to do the voluntary program, and we've put that into place, okay? So when you talk about that April 2, that's when we actually announced it to employees and kind of opened the window to the voluntary program. What happened with respect to production programs, George, is that we got to the end of the quarter, and frankly, all the way, coming up to the end of the quarter, we thought we had visibility to getting the 38 jets that we had in the plan. And we just had too much activity, particularly in the light side of the business, with customers who were talking about doing a deal, talking about doing a deal, who, again, are looking for more price at the end to close those deals. And as you can see, we ended up with 32 not 38. So we're not going to do that, and that's when we countered the decision. So look, guys, this is -- we're trying to put -- we're trying force transactions that just don't need to happen right now, and that's when we undertook the decision to go in on the light segment and make a material change to our production plans. And therefore, we need to tell you guys we made a material change to our production plans on the lights and have reset our sales targets and goals. And again, as I said earlier, it doesn't mean we're not going to be out there selling. We're continuing to grow our sales force. We're going to continue to do all those things, so we don't miss any deal. We've maintained our share. We'll continue to do that. But I think what we concluded by seeing the dynamic as we came into the end of the quarter is that the market really hasn't recovered or frankly, stayed as stable as we'd like to see and we ought to react to that by taking down on our production.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And a couple more on gross book-to-bill, Scott, was that much different than slightly below 1 net book-to-bill? I mean, we've done with these older cancellations that we...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, there were only a couple of cancellations in there. So I mean, gross book-to-bill was actually just a bit above 1.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And can you share what percentage of the deliveries for the rest of this year you might expect to come out of the current backlog versus how much yet you still need to get orders for?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, I don't think we'll...", "Unknown Executive", "[indiscernible]", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We've got the new products -- obviously, the M2s, which are in the third and fourth quarter, the Xs that are in the fourth quarter, I mean, these are orders that are already booked. So they're -- certainly, all the new models are coming out of backlog.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "And we began to build some on the Sovereigns.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And so we'll see no more Sovereign deliveries until the new ones because you basically stopped production and you're done with the inventory. Would the...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, that's correct, George. We had 5 Sovereigns that were the last 5 of that model type. All 5 of those aircraft sold in the first quarter, and so you'll start to see deliveries of block-point-changed Sovereigns in Q3.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And one last point, if I might. Industrial, that was weaker than I thought. You mentioned mix. Do I assume then that, relatively speaking, China was worse than Europe? Because I thought you do better in China than you do in Europe?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It was. The -- and the specific issue in China is that our strongest segment of our business in China is our manufacturing that's in China for the Japanese OEMs. And as we said at the end of last year, we saw -- well, in the last year, we saw a dramatic softening in that business as a result of some of the friction here between China and Japan. In essence, there was some boycotting of Japanese product even though it's manufactured in China, and that continued into the first quarter.", "Frank T. Connor", "Just to be clear, George, our results in the first quarter CapEx were not inconsistent with our expectations.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We expected -- I mean, we knew, based on what was happening late last year, George, that, that -- it was very likely that the friction with respect to Japan and China would continue and affect the sales of those models in China, and it has.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So a couple more questions on Cessna. Could you tell us what was the size of the preowned loss in the first quarter? Was R&D up? And give us some color on the pattern of the P&L for the year. I mean, is the second quarter likely to be in the red as a result of the $25 million charge?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Oh, yes, I would absolutely say so, Cai. And again, recognizing that $25 million is something which will accrete back over the balance of the year. But absolutely, when we take the costs of making those severance payments in the second quarter, that will for sure push Cessna into the red. On top of that, we have no Sovereign sales in the quarter because we don't have any block point until the third quarter. And yes, we've had some R&D and SG&A growth. Again, we're putting more sales and resource out there on Cessna, which I think we'll need to continue to do.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then to the question of preowned losses. How large were they?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. The used, kind of net of any forfeitures, was mid-single digits, and there was a low-single digit headwind year-over-year.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then update us -- I think you mentioned M2 in the third quarter. At one point, I thought that was going to be in the fourth. And [indiscernible]", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, I think, Cai, you and I have communicated incorrectly multiple times on this. And I'm not sure whether you started it or I started it, but the M2 will start deliveries in the third quarter.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the Sovereign is in Q3, early Q3. And when are we talking about the TEN?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "The X, by the way, we've gone back to just calling it the X because despite our best efforts, people just want to call it the X, so we've conceded that. The X will be the fourth quarter.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then you had a strong profit maybe as indicated, but the profit at TFC, how -- what was the reason there for that profit and the outlook for selling any additional markdown assets?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, there were a couple of relatively smaller transactions in the non-captive business, where we're still closing transactions, particularly in the Golf Mortgage portfolio where we have been able to close those at better values than were on the book, and so those resulted in some gains. In terms of the captive business, while there weren't a lot of originations in the quarter, the losses and provisioning and just general operation of the business was pretty solid.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then normally, you provided kind of updated sales and profit guidance for the year. I mean, can you offer any of that? You said Cessna is down a couple of hundred million in light jet sales. But any other color on any of these businesses? I mean...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, the only changes that we see in terms of our -- well, what led to our change in guidance, Cai, as I said, you're probably talking about a couple of hundred million dollars or so of revenue at Cessna, which will translate to a low, very low-single digit margin. And that really is the lion's share of the $0.20 reduction. So I mean, I think that math is easy to do. We probably will have and the revised guidance does reflect about a $10 million improvement in the knock that we would expect out of the Finance segment. The rest of the guidance in terms of revenue, margin rates are unchanged.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So really, the shortfall of Bell was related to the ERP issue and you expect to catch that up over the remainder of the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, absolutely. We were light on commercial spares. We shut the plant down for a week to make this transition so that put some pressure on us. But I'd actually say that the change has gone fairly well, considering big changes usually don't go well, but it's gone fairly well. But we got a little behind on a number of issues. Just kind of working our way through the bugs in the system that impacted spares, both military and commercial, but commercial probably most significantly. The demand in terms of orders on the commercial spares side actually was strong, and I would expect here, over the next couple of quarters, we will get those spares that are sort of in arrears, if you will, delivered.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then, the last one, any change in the tax rate expectations? You mentioned corp expenses still the same. Any other changes to the P&L we should be aware of?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, we don't expect -- as Frank said, I think the year -- the total year tax rate should be in line with what we expected. Obviously, this quarter because of the full year last year of R&D tax credit, as well as this quarter of the 2013 year, it just resulted in an unusually low number. But we would expect on target for the total year.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "I guess no Cessna questions left at this point, but let me just ask another one on Bell. Could you just remind us the expected year-over-year decline in margin rate at Bell? Outside of this Q1 issue, what's driving the expected margin rate decline?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure, it's mix largely driven by growth in commercial original equipment sales. So we expect to see a significant growth, as we saw this quarter, right, with 40 commercial aircraft versus 30. We expect to continue that sort of trend through the balance of the year. And as we've also talked about in the past, we have pretty significant increases in R&D, largely attributable to the 525, also a fair bit attributable now, as you see, on the V-280 Valor for the future Army program. And we see some increases, obviously, in SG&A as, again, we continue to expand and drive sales to keep growing in the commercial sector.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So no real change to military OE this year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No. As we've said before, there's always a pressure point on that as we renegotiate contracts around the next multiyear on V-22, which will really be a 2015 impact. Every year we go through renegotiation on rates on the H-1s. But at the same time, we're also trying to drive productivity and figure out how to recoup some of those costs, so there's always some pressure on the military side. But really, what's driving the margin here in 2013 is just disproportional growth on the commercial original equipment side, combined in particular with the R&D growth for 525 and the V-280.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On the delivery guidance at Cessna, are deliveries -- non-Mustang deliveries going to be actually lower year-over-year? Or are we -- just most of the year-over-year decline is related to the Mustang?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, this includes Mustang, but also the CJ2, 3 and 4.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Scott, I think, from what I've gathered, you've had some fairly high-level departures, sales force departures at Cessna. Can you just talk about maybe what's going on there, how you're restructuring the sales force at Cessna?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, we've had a lot of changes in the sales force at Cessna over the last few years, and I would say probably the most challenging for some of our people has been the fact that we're adding a lot of sales people. So we've taken regions and we've broken them into considerably smaller regions because we feel we need to do that to get better coverage. I think most of our sales people understand that, and they recognize that having a smaller region and getting better coverage will ultimately lead to more overall sales for the company. But obviously, it puts pressure on individual guys because they don't have as big an area to work with. And most of our folks have been good with that. We've made it a good transition for them, and we've added some real talent in terms of the sales team and the number of people that we have in the sales team. But frankly, we've had some people that have a hard time getting their head around that, right? They say, \"Well, jeez, I used to have 10 states, now I only have 3 states.\" And that's hard for some of them to accept that. And obviously, we try to work with them and say, \"Guys, this is not about you. It's not that you're not doing a good job. It's that we've asked you to cover a sales territory that's just bigger than one human being could reasonably cover and really talk to customers and know what's going on and find new opportunities.\" And as I said, most have been great about that. And we've made adjustments, and I think it's working, if you look at our share for what market is out there. But in some cases, it's just too much for somebody to get their head around and so be it.", "Operator", "And next we'll come to Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just on Cessna, I just wanted to follow up on the delivery sort of outlook commentary in that business. I mean, your deliveries were down sort of double digits in Q1. Revenues were up slightly, so I'm just looking at the rest of the 9 months. I mean, what kind of slope of year-on-year change in Cessna deliveries are you embedding? Are you embedding the fact that the year-on-year trend should be fairly similar to what you had in Q1 or with the new jets, with the easy comps, you'll actually get a decent recovery in the second half?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think given our revised guidance and expectations around the light segment of the market that you would expect to see, given that we'll be down in total year-over-year, that we'll continue to see fewer jet sales per quarter. Now one thing to keep in mind is I think it will be particularly low in the second quarter because you don't have any Sovereigns in that quarter. As you get to the third and fourth quarter, it's likely to be closer. Keep in mind, there's always variability here from quarter-to-quarter. So I mean, this is all sort of rough numbers for you, but clearly, given the revised guidance in total for the year, you'll expect to see a smaller number of jet deliveries for the total year.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure. But the guidance, I guess, does it therefore embed, based on what you just said, that in Q3 and Q4, it's down somewhat as well year-on-year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I don't -- I have not -- we don't have that quite that refined a process. But I mean, certainly, it was down in the first quarter. I would expect it to be down more so in the second quarter, particularly with the Sovereigns not being in there. And so third and fourth quarter will probably be close in terms of number of actual deliveries. But it's just hard to estimate that at this point.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure, okay. And then just on capital allocation, and so on, I mean, the manufacturing cash flow guidance has obviously been adjusted. I just wondered what the updated thoughts were on things like the dividend outlook and so on in light of that, the weak cash flow you had Q1.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the dividend outlook, I think, remains. Our position is, right now, our capital requirements are to continue to pay down debt. We did that in the first quarter. We have some fairly significant paydowns that happened here in the second quarter, and we have not published or decided on any revised dividend strategy at this point.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, just thinking about the cost base for businesses beyond just Cessna. Obviously, the South Korean contract has been somewhere else in the last day or 2. The Industrial profits are down 20%. I mean, it sounds like the trends in things like Bell and in Industrial are in line with what you had thought at the end of January. But I wondered if there was any sense of sort of preparation of plans for other segments in terms of cost reduction beyond just Cessna at this point.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, so I mean, I think, if you look at all the businesses, at Bell, in fact, there are some cost-reduction programs that are already underway in anticipation of some of the lower military volumes that we see as we go out into that '15 and on timeframe. This thing you mentioned with South Korea is certainly not something we've had in our plans, either near or long term. That's very much -- the product that was ultimately selected there is already very, very embedded in the country and utilized there. So it wouldn't have been a huge transition, frankly, I think to have gone a different direction and going with the Apache in South Korea, so that was never in our plans. And so there's no action we would take as a result of that. There are a number of other FMS opportunities. They're obviously in awards that we think will be things that we have a very real shot at winning on one front. But anyway, we have cost takeout plans and programs that are already underway at Bell, to cite that business, consistent with the military ramp-down, somewhat obviously offset by the fact that we have a growing commercial business. On the Industrial businesses, we're always looking very hard at the costs of that . We did have a much lower margin rate than we would like to have had on a normal basis in the quarter, although we sort of expected that given the dynamics of what was going on, particularly with automotive business in Europe and even more so in Asia, but again, consistent with our plans. So I don't think -- there's not a need or plan at this point that we'd announce any kind of a major restructuring in any of those areas. I think we're just going through some unusual market dynamics, and we'll work our way through that.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just lastly, on Bell, the margins there. You mentioned sort of specific issues around commercial aftermarket. And so -- I mean, is the assumption that those are now sort of finished and so Q2, you should see a decent margin ramp off the Q1 margin level that you saw? Or are they going to be similar?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, the issue, with respect to the systems transition in the first quarter, was around commercial and to some degree, military spares. And certainly, over the next couple of quarters, those things will catch up. There will continue, however, to be pressure on Bell in terms of margins. And that's factored by the fact that, I think, we'll continue to see growth in the commercial original equipment market, and we'll continue to have the same pressures that we saw in this quarter in terms of increased R&D spending associated with our new product programs. So I don't think there's anything -- there's nothing to happen in the first quarter or any dynamics or changes that we see that are inconsistent with the guidance that we provided for Bell Helicopter for the year.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Scott, so not to beat a dead horse, but kind of back to Cessna, what kind of indicators would you need to see to -- you take the cost out of the business through the voluntary stuff, to start going the other way? I mean, what would give you the confidence to say, \"Hey, you know what, actually things are getting better?\" What would you need to see?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "More customers signing the bottom line on the deal.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. And the whole...", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I mean, I don't mean to be trite, Ron. I mean, you know this is a tough situation, right? But this is -- I just want to be very clear. This is just our view of the market. And as we went through the quarter, despite -- Ron, you've been in this game a long time as well, right? You look at what's going on with used aircraft sales, you look at used available for sale. I mean, all of the corporate profits. You look at all of the sort of what would be the leading indicators, and all those leading indicators would tell you this market's turning. And yet, we didn't see it turning. And so I think that we have just to sort of face the facts and say, \"Guys, it hasn't turned yet.\" Now I don't know, in 3 months, 6 months, it's -- we can't guess. The good news for us, if you want to look at it as the good news, is we have the inventory. So the material is there. If in the next 3 months or 6 months or 9 months, we start to see more demand where those customers, particularly in that light side of the market, are saying, \"Okay, it's time for me to trade my aircraft.\" And again, most of these guys now have had aircraft much longer than they usually have aircraft. But once we start to see that, we have the ability to react to that. We have material in-house. We have the ability to do final assembly. We can put these things together. We can sell these aircraft. So we won't change our strategy in terms of increasing our sales resource out there. So we're talking to these customers, we know what's going on, we know where they're at. The only difference here is we're not going to try to grow forced deals. We're going to let the market recover and want the deals to take place.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Yes, that makes sense. So just another quick question, so in the quarter, I mean, the cash flow, you talked about it a little bit, I just want to see if I really understand what's going on. So inventory went up, so a lot of that cash that was used in the quarter was just inventory at Cessna. Is that right?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Actually, some at Cessna. Really, the big inventory build in the quarter was at Bell, and that's really because of the original equipment. Obviously, we had a fair number of dollars here of spare parts that didn't get shipped, okay. So there's a chunk of it that's just -- stuff that's sitting there. As we put the new system and just getting stuff shipped, build and moved is an issue. So that stuff, sitting inventory, which should have translated into revenue, and that will happen here over the next couple of quarters. But also, the fact that we're ramping the number of commercial helicopters. And again, the market on the commercial side, I think, is strong. I think we're going to continue to see good order and sales flow through the balance of the year. And we had what is unusually high amount of inventory build going into Bell, but it's mostly driven by -- again, some of it is sales that should have happened on the spare parts. But a fair chunk of it is just stuff now going to the work in process that will sell out through commercial helicopters in the balance of the year.", "Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then maybe one more, if I can. Maybe a much bigger-picture question, and I'm not asking you for guidance for future years. I know you can't do that. But when you think about your plan for the company, what if the business jets stayed slow for a while, I mean, longer than anybody hoped and you do get into an environment where V-22 numbers start coming down? This next multiyear is smaller, right? Probably the same thing happens to H-1. What do you do then? I mean how do you think about growing the business in that backdrop?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, obviously that's a challenge, right? I mean, I think, look, if you look at Bell, '13 is quite solid, '14 is quite solid. It's really when you get into 2015 that we have this transition where you see the V-22 numbers coming down. There's not a big transition at H-1 at that point. But part of it, obviously, is Bell on its own, what are we doing in terms of driving growth on the commercial side. The 525 program really kicks in, I think, and we'll start to see revenue generation and margin in the '16, '17 timeframe. So I think Bell on its own continue to be -- can continue to be a company, a business that grows. But there's no question that '15 will be a challenging year for them because you're really transitioning out of the V-22 volumes and you're not yet into the 525 volumes. Now obviously, we're working hard on 412s, and you're looking at the 407s. A lot of things we just announced is designed to drive commercial helicopter growth even before we get to the 525. But there's no question that 2015 is a bit of a swing year in there for Bell. On the Cessna front, I think we're in the fifth year -- it seems like about 20, but I think we're in the fifth year of sort of no growth in the business jet business. We still sort of have to believe this thing. It is a real market. It's a place that, at some point, needed to get back to growth, and I think every market forecast would tell you that. So does that not happen? I mean, we thought, surely, that happens in '13. If it doesn't happen by '15, I think that's -- again, that's way too far out for me to figure that out. Obviously, with the block point stuff coming in here at the end of the year, we think we've done some revamps to the product line that will help us. Also, by the way, when you get out to 2015, you've got the Latitude coming in, which is a fantastic new product. And this is an industry where new products do tend to drive growth, so I think we'll see that. So I think, as you say, it's too early, certainly, for us to even think about any kind of guidance in that range. But there are things that we're doing to try to drive growth through that 2015 around not just hoping the market does things, but also trying to do things in terms of new product. That's probably all I can say about it at this point.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a clarification first, the couple of hundred million, that's relatively isolated to the light market, it sounds like, which, just back of the envelope, would look like a pretty significant, kind of a 25%, 30% reduction year-on-year in your light market deliveries. Is that about what you're looking at x M2?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, that's probably about right. Correct, x M2.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So I guess at a high level, Scott, I'm sure you're getting tired of transition years in Cessna, so I'm curious, is this new look at production kind of a different approach, a way to purposely undershoot the demand curve, maybe claw back some pricing. And is the market now rational enough, without Hawker out there, that you could do that and this is actually maybe a positive?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, I am a believer in supply, demand. And I think we are at a point here where we're going to try to have to rationalize that and make a better estimate of trying to match supply and demand. I would say there's no question in my mind that as we look at the first quarter, our expectations for demand were nowhere near as strong as we thought they would be, and we had too much supply. And when you have that situation, I don't think that's particularly healthy from a pricing perspective. So there's no question that this is an effort on our part to do a better job of matching up supply and demand.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess, the question is more about, are you trying to purposely undershoot demand so that you can effectively take some medicine now, allow the absorption to happen and then have a better profile going forward, hopefully, as the market rationalizes.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, look, I think we're trying to match it. If we go under it a little bit, I'm not sure that's all bad.", "Operator", "And we'll move on to the next line, coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Just a couple of quick follow-ups to all this. One of my questions is kind of analogous to the prior question. If you look at kind of 3 years here in a row of kind of 180 units, plus or minus, and now we're going down, I mean, to what extent do you think the market actually was not allowed to clear, over this timeframe, through the actions of yourself and others on creative trade-ins and other things? And can you actually -- I'm sure you understand the gist of the question. Can you judge really the magnitude or if that is in fact an issue when there's a period of kind of further burning off kind of maybe the overproduction -- although it seems crazy to think 180 was overproduction, but burning off the overproduction of the last few years?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Jeff, I mean, obviously, it's very hard to gauge that. I don't think there's any question that the market was quite soft. As you say, it's hard to believe that 180 is too much, right, from our standpoint. And keep in mind, people don't push somebody's arm to buy a jet, right? I mean, this is a significant capital outlay, so it's not like you're going to force somebody to do it. But I do think that as a result of trying to sell aircraft when you do have a little too much supply, you're going to do things, from a pricing standpoint, that probably you should not do. And I think if you look at -- shares and whatnot have largely held steady through these phases. And I think we're just at a point right now where, from my view, clearly, we were going to have too much supply and that was going to create a lot of downward pressure on pricing in an industry that's already been a tough spot on pricing. So I'll just, to some degree, say, \"Okay, guys, look we just -- we don't have this lined up right this year and we're going to make an adjustment.\" So look, I don't want to be in a situation necessarily where if you have a customer that really wants to buy an aircraft that we don't have an aircraft available. But on the other hand, I think, we have to balance that with not having to go out and try to incent deals to happen that would not otherwise happen. So I mean, it's very -- there's no facts in this, right, Jeff? I mean, I do think we -- supply, demand is a very real thing. And I would probably say, yes, there has been too much supply, not enormously too much supply probably, I mean, as these transactions happen. But it looked to me like we're in a situation here where if we maintain the rates we have, we clearly are going to have too much supply.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Is the overhang from kind of plummeting Hawker used aircraft prices a big part of what's going on with your outlook for the year? Or is that more just kind of a headwind, an issue around the edges?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think the challenge for customers, okay, for guys that are operating Hawker aircraft, obviously, at some point, these guys are going to trade those aircraft in and buy new aircraft, just like any model of aircraft. There's nothing specific or unique going on there. But there's no question, as I said earlier, if you look at what's happened to the residual values of some of those aircraft, that is creating a challenge for some of those customers. Because that spread between what they can get for that used aircraft and what a new replacement is, is greater. So yes, I think that, that -- what we've seen in terms of those residual values is going to be, frankly, a long-term challenge for a lot of those customers because their collateral is just worth less. They're still going to want to upgrade. They're still going to do that over time, but it is going to put some financial pressure on them.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Right. And then, finally just on FMS for V-22. Obviously, on the second multiyear, the margins to the U.S. DOD come down, should we assume FMS margins come down similar -- obviously, they're ahead of that from the sale, yes, but will FMS margins be similar to the new lower DOD margins? Or will they be somewhere in between the new margins and maybe where you're running today?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Jeff, obviously, not having done one yet, we don't know for sure. But my expectations is that these FMS deals would effectively look like options exercised on top of the multiyear. So you would expect price and margin to be consistent with the current sales under the multiyear 2 [ph] program.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, that brings us to a wrap on the hour. Thanks for joining us. I know that we have a few follow-up calls in queue, and we'll make those callbacks at the conclusion of this call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "Thank you, Tani, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in our earnings release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Moving now to second quarter results, starting with Slide #3. Revenues in the quarter were $2.8 billion, down 6% from a year ago. Our income from continuing operations was $0.40 per share, which compares to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2012.", "Moving to cash flow. Second quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $362 million use of cash, and second quarter pension contributions were $17 million.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. We saw solid revenue growth at Textron Systems in our Industrial businesses, as well as strong commercial orders of Bell. On the business jet front, demand continued to be soft. As we announced in April, we took cost, production and pricing actions appropriate for this market environment. Specifically, we re-lowered our light jet production line rates, reduced associated direct headcount, downsized our indirect workforce and reduced our jet discount allowance. As we expected, reduced discounting to entice customers into the market did result in lower sales volume, as we delivered 20 jets compared to 49 a year ago. However, we achieved positive new jet pricing on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, which was our intent. We still believe the overall market demand will eventually recover as global economic -- the global economies continues to expand.", "With respect to the rollout of our new M2, Sovereign and Ten product lines, we're making good progress with certification testing. The aircraft are performing extremely well, although minor delays in avionics software certification has slightly delayed initial delivery dates. We would now expect M2 and Sovereign to begin shipping in the fourth quarter this year, with the new Citation Ten early next year. This will reduce total expected 2013 shipments resulting in a new full year Cessna revenue outlook of just over $3 billion.", "Looking longer term with new products, we're making good progress on our Latitude and Longitude platforms planned for service entry in 2015 and '17. In fact, the first Latitude fuselage and nose sections were mated last week, and we're on track for flight test early next year. Market receptivity for this new model has been a very good, as we conducted a 19-city tour with our mock-up during the quarter.", "Finally, on Cessna, we're making excellent progress in implementing our Chinese strategy to build and market Cessna Aircraft through in-country joint ventures. We completed the equipment and tooling installation for our new Chinese Caravan facility and expect deliveries to begin before year-end. We're also installing equipment and tooling at our newly constructed business jet facility and expect deliveries of XLS to begin next year.", "Moving to our finance segments. Slowness in the business jet market resulted in only a few new loan originations during the quarter. However, our segment profit benefited from good credit performance and a number of small-ask [ph] transactions in our non-captive business.", "In our Industrial businesses, we saw good growth in each of our businesses, reflecting strong auto markets in North America and new product introductions and expansions of our global distribution channels. We also had good execution with an overall incremental margin conversion of 39%. We'll continue to invest in new products in our Industrial businesses, as we believe that's the best way to win in the market and create high-value growth. For example, during the quarter, we did introduce our redesigned TXT golf car, updating the model's curb appeal and proven performance, while delivering new features, as well as increased durability and simpler maintenance.", "During the quarter, we also closed on the acquisition of Sherman & Reilly, a manufacturer of aerial and underground electrical power distribution and transmission products, which significantly expanded Greenlee's electrical utility product line.", "Moving to Systems. Revenues were up, reflecting growth in our unmanned air systems and precision munition product lines. We continue to see operational stability in our fee-for-service unmanned air vehicle systems contract. But as previously discussed, this eventually -- is essentially a breakeven program at this time for us. Our other major UAS contract is the Shadow Tactical Data Common Link retrofit program. This program is still in the development phase, and it now appears the completion of the development program will not occur in time to allow shipments of the production units that were planned for this year. As a result, Systems' 2013 revenues will probably be about $200 million lower than we previously expected.", "On the precision munitions front, we continue to ship product for the Saudi program under an undefinitized contract and expect a boost to Systems backlog in the third quarter as we recently came to agreement on final pricing. At TMLS, we're making good progress on our Canadian TAPV program, as we deliver our preproduction vehicles for initial performance testing. Across Textron Systems, we have a substantial amount of global sales activity underway for our products and continue to believe this business can maintain a flat to slightly growing top line over the next several years.", "Finishing with Bell, we delivered 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s in the quarter, flat with delivery in last year's second quarter. We signed a second V-22 multiyear contract to deliver 99 units beginning in late 2014, with options for 23 additional aircraft, with 1 already exercised. We're also in active discussions with several potential FMS customers. This should lead to additional V-22 volume in the second multiyear timeframe.", "Last month, our Bell V-280 tiltrotor platform was selected to participate in the U.S. Army's Joint Multirole Technology Demonstrator program. We believe the V-280 offers the Army the highest level of performance at test [ph], as well as the best overall value in terms of capability, procurement costs and operating costs.", "On the commercial side, we delivered 44 helicopters in the quarter versus 47 units in last year's second quarter. While deliveries were down, this was a result of commercial delivery timing and not a reflection of demand, as commercial order flow remained strong in the quarter.", "On the last earnings call, we indicated a transition to a new ERP system had negatively impacted our productivity in aftermarket shipments. We have improved operations, such that we are now shipping spare parts at levels higher than before we implemented the new ERP system, while we have further work to do implementing these systems and we'll be focused on improving operating productivity and output to reduce spare parts backlog and return to internal production schedules.", "On the new product front, we made a strategically important announcement at the Paris Air Show when we unveiled our new short light single, which essentially replaces our Legacy 206 JetRanger. With our recently upgraded 407 and 412 models, our new 429 and the planned 525, the new SLS will fill out our product line at the lower end. With over 4,400 JetRangers currently in service, there's meaningful existing upgrade market to support this demand. We're expediting development to bring this product to market as quickly as possible with the expected first flight late next year.", "To wrap up, we expect slightly lower full year results at Cessna and Systems and slightly higher results at Finance and Industrial. We're maintaining our guidance for 2013's guidance of $1.90 to $2.10 per share. We're also maintaining our projected 2013 cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension of about $400 million.", "In summary, we remain focused on improving our operational execution and cost productivity, and we remain committed to continue our investments in new products and sales capability to grow the business over the long term.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $213 million, down $97 million from the second quarter of 2012, on a $880 million decrease in revenues.", "Let's look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Cessna. Second quarter revenues at Cessna were down $203 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting lower jet deliveries. The segment had a loss of $50 million, primarily due to lower volumes, along with the impact of $28 million in pretax severance costs. We would expect that expense savings would offset most of the $28 million by the end of the year.", "At Bell, revenues were down $31 million, primarily due to lower commercial helicopter volume. Segment profit decreased $17 million, reflecting the lower volume and an unfavorable mix in our commercial business.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $33 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our UAS and weapons and sensor product lines. Segment profit decreased $6 million, reflecting a larger mix of lower-margin service contracts.", "Industrial revenues increased $45 million, reflecting higher volumes across most of the businesses and an increase from acquisitions. Segment profit increased $18 million, primarily due to improved performance and the higher volumes.", "Moving to Finance. Revenue decreased $24 million from last year's second quarter, reflecting lower Finance receivables. The segment had a profit of $15 million. Credit performance continued to improve during the quarter, with non-accruals of $124 million and 60-day delinquencies of $65 million.", "Moving to corporate items, starting with cash flow. Looking at our cash flow reconciliation, which is at the bottom of the manufacturing group cash flow schedule, which is attached to our earnings release, we've had a year-to-date use of cash from operating activities before pension contributions of $787 million. As reflected on our June 29 balance sheet, also attached to our press release, you can see that a significant portion of this cash use was driven by an increase in working capital. This was driven primarily by operations at Bell and Cessna. At Bell, this was the result of inventory builds for higher second half military and commercial deliveries and the productivity issues that Scott discussed earlier.", "At Cessna, the cash use reflected ramp-up of production for new M2, Sovereign and Citation Ten and lower-than-expected deliveries in the first half of the year. We expect these working capital increases to reverse during the second half of the year, as we deliver the higher volumes at Bell and as we certify our new models and deliver higher volumes at Cessna.", "Moving back to the P&L. Corporate expenses were $20 million, flat with the year ago. Interest expense was $30 million, down $5 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due to the benefits from the payoff of our convertible notes on May 1. Our diluted average share count during the quarter was 283.8 million shares, which was 11.7 million shares lower than last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting the share repurchases in last year's fourth quarter and the convertible notes settlement.", "Finally, our EPS guidance now reflects an annual effective tax rate of 28%, down from our previous guidance of 29%. This reflects lower domestic income at Cessna and Systems, which is subject to higher U.S.-based tax rates.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Scott or Frank, just to make sure I've got the production flow at Cessna about correct here. If I slide the Ten out and the Sovereign out, as you just indicated, versus my prior model, I show second half total deliveries down kind of 5% to 10% and full year '13 down something like 20% to 25% versus '12. Does that sound about right?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's probably about the right order of magnitude.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good. And then can you just go back to the avionics delays that you mentioned are driving that? And maybe give us a little more detail on exactly what's going on there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure, Noah. Look, we have, in both the M2, which is a Garmin 3000 cockpit, and the Ten and the Sovereign, which essentially have the same Garmin 5000 cockpit. We're trying to have one basic certified software build that really underlies all 3 of those platforms. The flight testing and the performance of the avionics equipment and whatnot, for the most part, has been quite good. The aircraft are performing extremely well, making great progress in all their flight testing. But our supplier has struggled going through this first -- our 25 cert and just getting everything all lined up and getting us a build of the software that will pass through all the final certification testings. We think we're there, frankly. I mean, it hasn't really impeded the flight test program. The aircraft have been continuing to run. We do have the initial builds of -- or the initial versions of the latest build that are in our own integration laboratories on the ground and look very good. The guys are very bullish that we think it has the things that it needs to have in it for the final cert, and so it's a matter of just taking those now and getting them into the actual aircraft. And then, frankly, going through the formal process and getting each of the aircraft through. And the only reason the Ten is pushing into next year is just the timelines to get the M2 through the certification process, get the Sovereign through it. It's probably going to push the Ten into beginning of next year. So it's relatively mild, modest in terms of its schedule impact, Noah. We're originally hoping to get the first couple of sales of M2s and Sovereigns late in the third quarter, and then we had always planned the Tens in the fourth quarter. And I just think with some of the, as I say, relatively minor delays in getting this final software build, it's pushed them out a couple of months, but that's enough to push it, all the deliveries of the M2s and the Sovereigns into Q4 and just realistically speaking as we focus on getting those through the process, so it'll push the Tens into the first of next year.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Scott or Frank, just on the cash flow, heard what you said on the inventory build at both Bell and Cessna. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on, I guess, what surprised you in the quarter? Or if it did at all, are you back on track? I know you haven't caught up at Bell for the ERP implementation, but are you back on track with where you originally would've thought you would've been? And then on Cessna, how are you going to make back the inventory build by the end of the year if some of these deliveries are getting pushed into 2014?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think Cessna is more or less to be expected. I mean, we know we're ramping up M2s. We're ramping up Sovereigns. We expected, as you know, to take down the light jet production volume, but obviously, we are finishing out the aircraft that were in the queue. So we certainly expected to see a significant inventory build at Cessna. We still believe that we will get the M2 and the Sovereign deliveries that we had in the plan for the year. It's just they'll all be fourth quarter instead of over the end of the third and into the fourth quarter. So the only ones that are really moving out in total are the Tens moving into next year. So for sure, there is some pressure there. On the other hand, we think there are opportunities, and we're certainly taking fewer trade-ins. So as we continue to work down our balance of used aircraft inventory, which we did again in the quarter, we think that helps to make up for some of that cash shortfall in terms of having the Citation Tens delayed into the first quarter of next year. So the Cessna situation, I think, is pretty well understood. There's not a lot of surprises there, and we'll work our way through that. At Bell, I would say, certainly to our plan, we're behind where we would like to be in terms of cash. As I said, in terms of how we're doing in this ERP system, particularly with respect to a lot of our parts shipments, be it into the spares or into our final assembly factories, the improvement in that area is kind of back to plan. But it did not catch up where we were behind in the first quarter. And so that's the work we still have to do. So we're -- the system is running. I mean, we can demonstrate that we can now ship the parts at levels at or above where we were before we put the system in. But we haven't yet achieved the level where we were able to burn down that backlog. But we certainly have expectations that'll happen through the course of the year. And that also results in getting things around progress billings and things like that, where you don't have as much in progress that has been accomplished, and therefore, you're behind on some government billings. But again, as we get that system recovering and get it stable and work our way through the rest of the year, we think we will recover that.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So it's fair to say that we should see improvement certainly in Q3, particularly at Bell? And then a lot of the improvement at Cessna comes in Q4 because that's when all the new deliveries take place?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, that's exactly right.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then over in Industrial, margins were quite good, the highest in, I think, a very, very long time. You attributed it to performance and to volume. How should we be thinking about the upside opportunity to what you've been putting up in the past is sort of the 8% level as we go forward? Or are we going to revert back to that level?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, as you know, our Industrial businesses are each cyclical in their own nature. So I think I wouldn't expect to see 9%, almost 10% margins in the last 2 quarters. But I certainly would expect to see margin expansion over what the margins have typically been in the third and the fourth quarter. So I think performance will stay strong. The strategy we have around there, both in terms of productivity and driving more sales and new products is working, and I think it'll continue to work. So certainly, there is the seasonality, but I would expect to continue to see margin expansion in the Industrial businesses.", "Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one more, Scott, could you comment on demand, in particular for midsized aircraft? Have you filled those initial Sovereign slots for the new version of the aircraft and maybe just address XLS demand?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "So Sovereign demand, I mean, we are starting, obviously, to take orders for the new Sovereign. We just got the first production aircraft off the line only a few weeks ago. And that thing has been on a very, very steady and busy tour of flying around and doing demo flights. So we really didn't have the sales tool in place until here just very recently, but the aircraft is out there, flying a lot of customers. And I'd say we have a pretty strong list of customers that are interested in the new Sovereign. It's always been a very popular aircraft. People that have them, love them. And it's a very nice refresh to the aircraft. So as I said, we have started to take orders and put them into the backlog, but we've only really been out there able to show people the aircraft and demo fly it here in the last few weeks. So it's, I would say, it's building some pretty reasonable momentum in terms of the customer prospect list. XLS demand has been pretty steady through the quarter and no real change. In terms of the light jet market, as I said, there's -- the market is still very soft. And if you're not out there doing pretty aggressive discounting and trying to go to customers that are not ready to move yet, you're not going to see a whole lot of volume. That's exactly what we expected to see in the marketplace. So there's obviously some activity, but it's still pretty soft.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Godwin [ph] with Morgan Stanley.", "Unknown Analyst", "In the release, you described the Cessna production cuts as the right actions. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit. Of course, demand continues to be soft. So I was just curious, would continued softness in biz jet trends from here cause you to revisit production even further and potentially reduce it again? Or by right actions, do you mean that the data that you see and the conversations that you're having suggest that you've really hit the right level given where demand is?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I mean, obviously this a very fluid situation, so I don't think we'll ever say, \"Hey, we're done one way or the other.\" So in the case of the lights, we scaled back what we thought our target for the year would be around sales of those aircraft. And I would say, at least looking into what we are anticipating for the third and fourth quarter, we think we're in the right place. On the other hand, if you look at M2s, the market demand for that new product has stayed fairly strong, and we've actually gone in and tried to figure out how to add some additional slots into next year, because we're in a situation right now where we see some transactions happening and the M2 would be the right aircraft for the customer, but it's -- we don't have available slots for them. So we've had some adjustments, obviously, that we took down this year around some of the light models, comfortable with where we are right now. That doesn't mean we would change it up or down based on what we see demand changing in the marketplace. But I think what we took those down to, our view right now is that's probably the right number in terms of our current production role. And then, of course, we have the M2 where we're going to go try to find a way to insert some more available slots into 2014 because we think the demand is there.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, that's very helpful. And I was hoping you'd talk a bit about what the sales force is telling you the customer response was to the production rates. Of course, you had some good comments on incremental pricing. Is that just sort of simple supply-demand rebalancing? Or is there any kind of new or renewed sense of urgency to transact that wasn't in the customer conversations before the cuts? Just any clarity or background there would be helpful.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure. I know I would categorize it as a supply-demand balancing. So the transactions that I felt that we were doing that we wanted to get away from doing, we're trying to go in and do some additional discounting to get a customer who's ultimately going to upgrade their aircraft and trying to pull them forward to get them to upgrade now. And so as we took that sort of aggressive discount out and didn't go try to pursue and try to get somebody to come into the market that didn't feel they were ready to come into the market, obviously, those transactions have gone away. So -- and -- customers are fine with that. When you have customers that say, \"Hey, I'm okay where I am probably for another year or 2,\" then that's fine. They'll keep flying their current aircraft for another period of time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the Cessna margin in the quarter. If you exclude the severance costs that you called out last quarter, you're still decently negative. I wondered if there were any other cost action items there? Or maybe you could comment on any impact from used aircraft in the quarter? Any color there would be helpful.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure. So obviously, the vast majority of it was associated with the severance costs, which is the $27 million that we have in there. There were about $8 million of used aircraft residual write-downs. But other than that, it was just a very, very light delivery quarter. And so there's just not a lot of cost absorption on 20 jets.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just as a clarification, when you say pricing improvement from the actions you took, is that sequential improvement versus last quarter or year-over-year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sequential and year-over-year actually.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And one final one. In Systems, you mentioned the definitization of the Saudi contract. Does that result in any material margin impact versus what you had under the undefinitized contract before?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, it doesn't. We were -- where we ended up was roughly the pricing that we expected in terms of how we've been booking the deal. So I think the only real consequential outcome you'll see of that becoming a definitized contract is it'll all go into backlog as opposed to just what was under the undefinitized contract.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, I'd like to follow up on your comment earlier that you mentioned about continued softness in light demand, of apparently, a pickup in demand for the mid-cam [ph]. Do think there are some of the sort of structural change here in terms of the business jet market that is preferring these larger jets?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Robert, I think we just continue to have a view of the market that says the light market, the light to small mid-market is really a small to midsize business person, and they're more economically sensitive than large corporations and other corporate operators of aircraft that tend to have larger aircraft. So I think the confidence in the economy around that small to midsized business community has been a little more subdued. And so when you look at a large corporate operator, they get so many years in, they're going to roll that aircraft. I mean, they're very worried about reliability and availability and aircraft on ground, these sorts of things, and I think they're more inclined to accept a more difficult residual value environment and go ahead and roll the aircraft anyway. When you look at a light operator that historically, yes, they like to roll it at 5 years or 7 years, I think with residual values where they are right now, they're inclined to say they'll stick with it for another year or 2. So that's our general sense. A lot of people we see coming in right now are coming in. They're coming from the places they usually come from in terms of light jets, right? They're coming out of a turboprop or a light single and something like that. But you don't see as much activity of the people who are current CJ operators that are doing their upgrade. Eventually they will come, but I think a lot of it just has to do with where the residual values are. And the used aircraft market, certainly from a volume standpoint, the number of aircraft has been dropping and dropping, but it's still a fairly significant number. And I think the biggest challenge is that we haven't really seen, for sure, have not seen a price recovery in terms of used aircraft values. And I think those are the things that need to happen before you're going to see -- or a significant strengthening in the economy, where people feel better about what's going on, before you're going to see a lot of activity in the light market.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And the second question, I was wondering if you could comment on the demand environment in terms of geographical regions. If you're seeing any differences versus maybe what you said 3 months ago in U.S., Europe or Asia?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, it's still very much U.S.-centric. There's a little bit of activity in Europe, very light activity, frankly, in Latin America, some in Asia, not very strong on the lights. A lot of demand in Asia on the Caravan. We're seeing a fairly strong demand for our turboprop business over there. But in terms of the jet market, it's very North American-centric.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Let me just ask, I guess, a couple of Bell questions, just for something different. On the SLS, Scott, I mean, some of your competitors sell helicopters in that range, 100 to 200 helicopters a year. Is that the kind of opportunity that you're thinking for that model?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It is. I mean, I think our principal competitor in this market right now, Peter, really is the guys that have moved in into the Robinson R66s. That's really the space that we're targeting. It's kind of that price point. I think we have -- it'll be a little different performance for us, but it's in roughly in that price point. And it's probably a 200-, 300-helicopter-a-year market.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Great. And then any progress on the 429 weight approvals from the FAA?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Not from the FAA. We continue to get more countries that are approving it based on the Canadian certification. So we see the market continue to grow internationally for it as it's approved. I think the situation with the FAA, Peter, is that, as you may have read, there's really an activity going on right now within the FAA to look at this whole issue of, is 7,000 pounds the right number to delineate between the current certification standards, whether it's a 27 or 29. And this has happened in the past, by the way, right, where as technology changes and what's available in the market changes and technologies change from particular, is it appropriate to have a specific weight that delineates the difference? If so, is it the right weight? And so really what's happening right now is there is a broader review of this issue going on in the FAA, and I suspect that where we'll end up will really be reflective of where the FAA wants to go in the future in terms of how they're going to delineate between Part 27 and 29 service.", "Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then just broadly, on the Bell commercial helicopter, I guess, cycle, you mentioned timing during your, I think, your opening remarks. You don't sense that the commercial helicopter cycle is slowing at all? You just think you had a timing issue in the quarter? And overall, the commercial helicopter up-cycle is sort of still intact. Is that kind of your view?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It is. There's no change to our view. The quarter actually was quite strong in terms of order rate, so a lot of order activity. We were light a few helicopters versus a year ago, but that really just has to do with customer delivery timing. And there's no change in our view of what's going on in the market nor our expectations in terms of our deliveries for 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So, Scott, you mentioned improvement in pricing at Cessna sequentially and year-over-year. And yet, if one looks at the used market, it looks like those prices continue to kind of soften. So do you feel you've kind of hit equilibrium here where basically the prices really have held and can get better from here? Or are you concerned that the weakness in the used market is going to catch up with you, and so you're going to have continuing pricing pressures in your business?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, Cai, I think that part of what's going on with the new aircraft pricing was also driving the residual value on the used aircraft. So it's actually a little bit the other way. And I guess, one thing I want to be clear about. I don't want to mislead anybody, all right. We got better pricing in the quarter with both sequentially and year-over-year, but we're hardly taking aircraft back to list pricing. These are still attractive prices for customers versus historical levels, okay? So there is still discounting going on. It's not like this has snapped back to all of a sudden, people are going to be selling at list price. So I do think that pricing will continue to reflect sort of the tone of what's going on in the market. It was just our view that coming out, particularly out of the first quarter, and I looked at what was going on from a pricing standpoint, was getting to the point where it didn't make any sense do these deals, okay? So I mean, we need to go back to a level of price that is still a fair, an attractive deal for our customers, but one which is also a reasonable deal for our company to be able to continue to invest in new products and, et cetera. So that correction, I think, was very important. And I'm glad that we made it, and I think it's appropriate that we make it. But these products are still very attractive in terms of how they're priced at this point, even going back modestly above where they were in 2012. So used aircraft pricing, Cai, absolutely, I think is still going to be a challenge. But I think that there -- it's more of an impact to the ability for somebody to trade in and what their residual value is, as opposed to how it should necessarily pressure new aircraft pricing.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Was there any change as you went through the quarter in terms of the tone of demand in any respect?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Not really.", "Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then you'd mentioned the avionics delay, and obviously, you already were planning most of the delivery of Sovereigns and M2s in the fourth quarter. But obviously, I assume some of those have slipped into next year. Approximately how many of those new plane deliveries that you'd expected this year slipped into next year?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "As I said, I really still expect that we will get the M2 and Sovereign deliveries that we were expecting. They'll just be in the fourth quarter instead of getting some done in the beginning -- or the end of the third quarter. The only aircraft that I really view as moving into the next year as a result of these delays are the Tens.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Frank, just a quick question for you. The corporate line in the income statement seems to bounce around from quarter to quarter. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the second half and your view, all else being equal at this point, stock price and all the other inputs that go there, what we should expect on the corporate line for the second half of the year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, I mean, the corporate line kind of, generally, if you look at kind of how we guided it, runs about kind of $35 million to $38 million on average. And it bounces around, as you say, because of that kind of share price activity and what that does in terms of just the stock-based compensation expense. And so if you kind of think $38-ish million type area per quarter, that's a normalized type of level for that expense.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And that's what's baked into your guidance then for the full year, this $38 million both in the third and fourth quarters each?", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, that type area, $37 million and $38 million.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Scott, just a quick question on Cessna and the margins there. Can you just give us a little bit of color around your expectations on incremental margins, assuming we get some year-on-year growth going again there? What we ought to expect from incremental margins on a go-forward basis? So I think you've talked about a range in the past, and I was wondering if you could give us an update there.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, we generally expect to see 20%, 25% incremental margin on volume growth at Cessnas.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And these most recent actions don't change that at all, the headcount reductions?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, because it's largely trying to size based on what we anticipate volumes to be. I mean, those are the actions that we have to take if we're going to adjust the business accordingly in terms of what the revenues are going to look like.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes. Okay, great. And then last one, Scott, could you -- in the past, you've given us a little bit of your expectations around the biz jet market in China. I was wondering, generally speaking, you talked a little bit about your production actions, but can you talk a little bit about the market itself and the development of the biz jet market in China and where we are today?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, we still have expectations that we're going to see growth in the Chinese market in terms of -- and remember, I'm talking about our products, which are primarily aircraft that would be flown within China, not in and out of China, so it's a domestic aircraft. It is still, today, not an easy market from that standpoint, because it's not easy to fly internal just in terms of the air space management. But we have every indication and certainly see activities going on that would lead us to believe that, that's going to continue to liberalize. So there's a lot more liberalization of lower altitude airspace that's happening. We see this in selling Caravans. We see it in selling helicopters. A lot of this air space is going to become more open. But it's certainly our expectation that they'll start to open up and make it easier to fly within the country at the higher altitudes, which is really obviously the land of the jets. So our focus here right now is making sure we have a good sales team in place and start to do the market development activities, so that as we continue to sell into that market, we make sure that we're present and see every opportunity. And obviously, the XLS manufacturing in Zhouhai, which we expect to kick in and start deliveries next year, is specifically targeted at those opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, I had a question on the Bell margins. In the first half, they were down around 100 bps. Year-on-year, you had a sort of 40%, 45% decremental. If you're thinking about the second half, I mean, is there anything in terms of the phasing or the weighting of R&D for things like the 525, the V-280, that maybe changed that dynamic? Or R&D is fairly well, smooth through the year?", "Frank T. Connor", "Fairly smooth, Julian. I mean, we're still on track for our original guidance between 13% and 14%.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then in Cessna, if we're thinking about, I understand the push outs and so on. I mean, excluding that, it sounds as if volume and pricing are tracking pretty much in line with where you would've thought back in April and May. I just wanted to check if that's the case? And more specifically, what's going on with Cessna aftermarket? I think that was up about 9% in Q1. Just what sort of trend did you have just now?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "It's up again in this quarter in both parts and services. So guys are still flying the aircraft, utilizing the aircraft. And we're seeing, I'd say, reasonable growth on the service side of the business. And in terms of the volume of jet production, as I said, I think the numbers we're looking at right now in terms of the performance this quarter and our expectations here through the second half of the year, we feel like our plans in terms of production that we laid in are probably about where they need to be. So I'd say it's, at this point, we still have the same expectations that we had when we talked to you after the first quarter call.", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. And then lastly, just if you could -- obviously, rates are moving around and so on, just a reminder on what the anticipated pension effect on earnings is for '13?", "Frank T. Connor", "It's -- oh, for '13.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "'13, it was...", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes, if you're willing to talk about '14, that would be great, but I just -- any view on either.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I thought it was 1 30...", "Frank T. Connor", "Well, no, for '14, the pension expense was $225-ish million area, which was a meaningful headwind to our 2012 level.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "[indiscernible] expense budget [ph].", "Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And the expectation for the effect in '13?", "Frank T. Connor", "That -- I'm sorry, so on '13, we had about $55 million of pension headwind, and total pension expense was about kind of $225 million. And in '14, we should no -- we would expect, it depends on rates and lots of things between now and then, but we would expect that we will no longer see a headwind. We should see a bit of a tailwind. And obviously, that'll depend on kind of discount rates and returns for the rest of the year and lots of other factors. But we, as we sit here today, we would not expect to continue to see a pension headwind as we move into '14.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Just cleaning up a few things. Used aircraft, that charge of $8 million or write-down of $8 million, is that on aircraft that are now no longer in-house? And can you give us some color on the size and dollars and/or units of your used aircraft inventory?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Those -- that $8 million is a charge against our current inventory based on the residual values. We obviously had some sales of aircraft in the quarter, Jeff. And I don't think there was an appreciable gain or loss on sale of those guys. So they're marked to roughly the right spot. I think there was a very modest gain this quarter. But we don't talk about the specific numbers of aircraft on the used side. We did sell -- we didn't sell quite as many as we did year-over-year, but actually dollar volume of the sales was actually a bit higher than it was year-over-year.", "Frank T. Connor", "And net inventory went down slightly, Jeff.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Right. Net inventory -- yes.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Net inventory is down?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Right.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And then just kind of back to Cessna, so effectively, what you're telling us, right, is M2 was sold to your plan now through 2014. I mean, obviously, I don't know precisely what your plan is, but I'm hoping we can kind get kind of bigger than a breadbox type of thought process here. If I think about M2, obviously, clearly is going to hurt M1. I think you would agree with that. I don't know if you do. But if I think about M1 plus M2, are we looking at unit volumes equivalent, or maybe even better than kind of the 40-ish a year that we were seeing in 2011 and 2012?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think it's a fair way to look at it, Jeff. I mean, it's sort of an equivalent number. Mustang deliveries have been at a relatively low rate just because, again, we see a relatively small number of people coming into that market. But certainly, when you look at the total for the entry jet market, there's now 2 ways to participate in that with us, right? Either the Mustang or the M2. And so, yes, you got to think about kind of annualized roughly the same number of aircraft with a, I think, at least in the early years, a significant mix shift towards the M2.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And then kind of along the same lines, your confidence on clearing the WIP inventory in Cessna, obviously comes around moving the Sovs and the Tens that you're building. Can you give us some color on how you're sold on those relative to your production plan on whatever horizon you're comfortable talking about it, whether it's through Q4 or into 2014?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I guess, just from color standpoint, I mean, the Tens are pretty sold. That's been out there for a while. We've been able to market and sell that aircraft. On the Sovereign, we still have a number of aircraft to go sell. But as I said earlier, we really have only had the first demonstrator aircraft to take out and start doing demos and flight tours here over the past month. So as I said, we have started to take orders. We have started to close deals, but we still have more aircraft to sell here for the 2013 plan. But we think we have a pretty reasonable level of interest in the customer community and a lot of people that are talking to us, a lot of people are doing demo flights. But that process is still fairly early.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Right. And then finally for me, just Bell commercial, can you give us kind of just the rough percentage delta. What you think full year volumes look like versus 2012?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I think we guided we would be up significantly, and I think that's how it's playing out.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. So notwithstanding the little hiccup in Q2, the back half looks very strong?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, I mean, the Q2 is just -- we line up with customer delivery dates. So unfortunately in Q2, there were a number of aircraft, particularly larger aircraft, that are heavily, more heavily weighted towards the third and fourth quarter.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And I'm sorry, just finally, one more. So just thinking about all this, actually the incrementals in Cessna with the charge and the used aircraft and everything aren't awful, actually. For as much as production is down, I would say, it's kind of admirable, although it's a tough market for you. But should we think of Cessna, I mean, Cessna should be breakeven or better in Q3? Is that a reasonable expectation?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Again, Jeff, it's so sensitive to the volumes of aircraft and without having any of the M2s or Sovereigns in Q3, I think that's going to make that a challenge. I mean, obviously, that's what we're trying to do. I think, look, the bottom line here is that the team out there, I think, is doing a heck of job in a pretty tough environment. They have driven a lot of cost productivity, and I think that's part of what you're seeing. I mean, we're not just saying, \"Well, it's a bad market, so everything's going to a disaster.\" We can't possibly be happy about anything that has a red number associated with it. But the guys are simultaneously trying to drive as much productivity and go through the challenges of reducing and eliminating an awful lot of jobs to respond to what's going on in the market. At the same time, they're trying to invest a ton of money in developing a bunch of new products that will help us both this year or next year and into the future. So it's a tough balancing act. But I think those guys are doing a heck of a job, trying to do everything they can to manage costs and make sure that we do as well as we can in a tough market. And obviously, I think, position us so that when this thing does play itself through on this cycle, things will come out very well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Just a follow up on a couple of numbers, Scott. You kind of said aftermarket sales of Cessna were up. Were they up in the 5% to 10% area like they were in the last quarter?", "Frank T. Connor", "They were up 16%, but keep in mind that we had some M&A over the past year in the service center. So on an organic basis, it was high-single digit.", "George Shapiro", "And the used plane sales that were in the quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'm sorry, George, what about the used aircraft in the quarter?", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Could you just give us what the sales volume was?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I don't think we've given the specific numbers, George. As I said, we were down a couple in terms of units, but on a year-over-year basis, we were actually up in terms of the sales volume. So they were more expensive, larger aircraft.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then, Scott, the CJ4 was particularly weak this quarter. I mean, you kind of been running double digits, and it dropped to 4. Is there any reason for it? Or is it just succumbing to the light weakness? And then would you expect that to rebound some in the third quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think, George, it probably is a reflection a bit of this notion that people that already have CJs aren't going to do an upgrade at this time. And we see a lot of people that are going to the CJ4s that might be current CJ2 or 3 operators right now. So I think that's probably a little bit a good example of it. If you don't see a whole of upgrade activity going on, you're probably not going to see as many more people move into the 4s.", "George Shapiro", "So what -- in third quarter deliveries, I mean, what's able to drive it significantly higher or maybe it's only a little bit higher than the 20 that we saw in the second quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'd have to say, George, it's probably just sort of the normal cyclicality of people buying aircraft. [indiscernible] we look at what's going on in the customer community and the number of deals, the number of prospects on every aircraft type. So it's -- we're not particularly guiding a specific number of aircraft in the third quarter. But I would -- looking at it right now, we'd certainly expect it to be higher than the 20 that we saw in the second quarter.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then just a more general one, Scott, you had mentioned after the first quarter, you weren't going to cut price, and we clearly saw that in lower orders this quarter, although better quality orders. The fact that you didn't succumb to that temptation at the end of the quarter, does that change people's minds sufficiently, that we go into the third and the fourth quarter here, that they recognize that they're going to have to pay a better price if they want an airplane? I mean, can you talk about that mentality that's out there?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, George, it's a very good question and it's part of the theory, the case that we have, but we don't know the answer to that yet, right? I mean, without a doubt, some calls happened at the quarter saying, \"Hey, are you ready to make a deeper discount to get a deal done?\" And the answer to that question is, no. And so for sure, there's some deals that probably could have happened this quarter that didn't because we're not prepared to go with those price levels. As I said earlier with Cai, you guys, we're not going to go back to list pricing, all right? I mean, but these are still attractive prices and we're certainly hopeful that those customers who want to upgrade, have a reason they want to upgrade to a new aircraft, will consider coming in and paying a reasonable price. But we're not going to go do that kind of aggressive discounting at the last moment to try to get a deal across the goal line. So whether that's actually happens in practice versus just theory remains to be seen. But certainly, there were some people that were looking for bigger discounts to try to make a deal happen. And again, that goes back to price levels that don't make sense for us. So I think, I hope we're at the point now where the number that we can put on the table for that customer is a very fair and reasonable number. And it's a number that they'll be comfortable with, and ultimately, will trade in or buy the aircraft.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So just, I guess, the first one is sort of the high-level assessment EBIT margin guidance for the year. Is the full year anticipated to be still better than breakeven now?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "That's certainly our objective. Again, it's going to be very volume-sensitive. But certainly our plan would be to get it above the breakeven line on the year.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then Bell aftermarket in the first quarter had the ERP issues and was down. What was it like in the second quarter? And can you give us some perspective on the military aftermarket, in particular?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "If you look at the total aftermarket, we were on what our original plan was for the quarter, okay. So the system, we have figured out how to operate with the new system. In some cases, with the system, around the system, sort of going through the usual things you go through on one of these big system implementations. But anyway, the operation is certainly back and while it's -- we have our share of challenges, we're able to deliver what we need to deliver. The only unfortunate part is, we did not eat into the miss that we had in the first quarter.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So what was the aftermarket sales in the quarter in terms of directionally up, down, how much?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "On a year-over-year basis, it was...", "Frank T. Connor", "It was up low-single digits.", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, it was up, but up modestly on a year-over-year basis.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, just confirming. So on the R&D expectation for the full year, I think, it was expected to be somewhere in the kind of $500 million, low $500 million range. That hasn't moved as a result of kind of the development timelines? Is that still the right place holder?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Yes, these issues on certification really don't have much of an impact on the R&D front at this stage of the game. Most of the R&D's invested. It's simply a timing on going through the final certification. If you look at Cessna, a lot of the R&D now has moved into the Latitude program. And as Doug said earlier, the Bell, Bell's on track and relatively level load in terms of its R&D investments, kind of driven by the 525 and now the SLS and V-280.", "Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And only one other one, another manufacturer had similar issues with delays in avionics caused the avionics suppliers to forward advances to the manufacturer. Is that something you're pursuing as a result of the delay in certification?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "No, it's not. Look, I think our supplier has been very genuine in their efforts to get this thing done. I think that there were some deals made with other customers because, frankly, they said, \"Look, we've got more on our plate than we can handle. And we're going to go focus on getting this deal done for Cessna,\" because we were kind of first in the queue. And so I think we are the guy, I believe, that's getting the top priority and getting the energy put into it. And look, in the grand scheme of things, I don't like having a certification date slip out, but this is a relatively mild, modest slip. And I do believe these guys are dedicating the resource and everything they can to keep it on track. So, no, at this point, we're not in a position to try to go look for any kind of damages. I think they're in good faith doing everything they can to get us going.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.", "Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron this morning. I guess my question comes from about Systems margins. So margins were down about 200 basis points this quarter even though revenue was up 8.5%. I just wondering if you can walk through maybe the factors that drove the margin contraction in this quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Well, I think the most significant element is that these fee-for-service contracts were basically booking at 0 profit, right? So we had taken a charge last year and basically did a total program or task order estimate to complete that took it from a loss contract and basically booked forward on a breakeven basis. And so obviously, there is dilution to our overall margin rates associated with that. So I think, if you looked at the margins in our other businesses, they're standing where we would expect them to be in the double-digit, above double-digit kind of margin rates, but we're seeing dilution from our UAS business principally.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes, the other place we saw a little bit of margin impact there from a volume-mix standpoint is in our armored security vehicle, where we're doing more reset volume relative to production volume than we had in some previous quarters. And so we saw some additional ASV volume that was reset volume with lower mix rather than production.", "Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And last week, I heard from Defense Secretary Hagel that sequestration could cut investment [ph] account by 15% to 20% in fiscal year '14, so starting October 1. This cut is larger than what we've heard before. So are you seeing any sort of customer behavior changes? Or do you see further downside risk to your defense outlook for the rest of the year, particularly in the second half?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "I'm sorry, for the rest of this year?", "Kristine T. Liwag - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes. Because right -- fiscal year '14 would start on October 1.", "Frank T. Connor", "Yes. No, I don't think we would expect that. And for us, like it's principally driven by the fact that we have a multiyear deal around V-22s. So we know what those unit volumes look like. Our other big deals with Cessna or at Bell, rather, are around H-1 and the unit volumes on the production side of that have been stable. Obviously, our Armored Security Vehicle businesses, our precision munition businesses are virtually all international businesses at this point, so they really have no exposure. The area that we're probably the most sensitive, with respect to sequestration issues, is around our unmanned air vehicle business and some of our intelligence software and geospatial analysis intel businesses, which are funded more on a year-to-year basis. And so when they change budgeting, those things can be affected year-to-year. And we've seen some pressure in those businesses, but not something that I would say is material. And we certainly don't have any reason to believe there'd be any material change to this calendar year with respect to the sequestration, further sequestration discussions.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Steve Levenson with Stifel.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us an update on the timetable for the 525, please?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "Sure. 525 is progressing very nicely. We'll be flying that aircraft next year, which was our original plan in 2014. We're obviously in work with the FAA around certification dates. We have not announced a certification date yet for that aircraft. But I think we -- it's still our expectation that we'll be flying it next year. And we'll likely certify -- we haven't given a hard date to customers yet, but probably sometime out in 2015.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And last, what stage are you on partnering on the V-280? Or is it a little premature for that still?", "Scott C. Donnelly", "We have a number of partners that are part of the V-280 program. And to be honest, I don't know how much we've publicly announced. So I got to be careful here that I don't announce something we haven't announced. But we have several partners. It's a very -- it's not a structure like we had with Boeing on the V-22, right, where it's a Bell-Boeing function. But we have a number of very strong partners that will have portions of the V-280 product. And those discussions are, frankly, pretty mature at this point, but we just haven't publicly announced them yet.", "Douglas R. Wilburne", "All right, thank you, ladies and -- go ahead. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Go ahead, Tani.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Textron 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Wilburne", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. For everybody\u2019s reference, our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "During the course of our call, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations including our 2014 outlook. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. We would also like to point out that our 2014 guidance will not include the impact of our planned acquisition of Beechcraft. We will update our 2014 guidance to account for the impact of the acquisition after we have closed the transaction.", "Moving now to fourth quarter results, starting with slide number three in our earnings presentation. Revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up 4.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $0.60 per share, compared to $0.50 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "This was a few cents higher than we were expecting at the end of December when we indicated that we would likely be below the bottom end of our guidance range as a result of better operating results in our manufacturing businesses.", "Moving to cash flow, fourth quarter manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $774 million, bringing our full year manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to $256 million. Full year pension contributions were $194 million, which reflected a $21 million contribution during the fourth quarter.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Overall, we had a good fourth quarter to close out the year with revenue growth at Cessna, Bell and Industrial and strong cash generation across all our businesses. Moving to our Textron Systems segment, revenues were down in the quarter as expected primarily due to lower UAS and precision weapon shipments in the quarter compared to a year ago. Operationally, Systems had a good quarter with 9.8% margins.", "We also continued to make progress on the Ship-to-Shore Connector and Canadian Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle program while continuing to make on-time deliveries on our existing Afghanistan National Army Vehicle contract. In our UAS business, we saw improvement in the operating reliability of our Aerosonde fee-for-service aircraft reflecting installation of Lycoming Build Engines into the fleet.", "Also within the UAS business we made good progress in the shadow TCDL development program which we believe puts us on track to begin delivering production units in the second half of this year.", "Finally we closed on the acquisitions of OPINICUS and Mechtronix in December and we are now in the process of combining with our existing military simulation business at AAI to establish the new Textron Simulation and Training Systems business. Jim Takats, the former CEO of OPINICUS is the President of the new unit and with his team he is busy with integration activities and business planning. As we look to 2014 for Systems, we significant top-line expansion led by growth in the UAS revenues, primarily from delivery of TCDL systems and the impact of the Simulation and Training business which should lead to improvement in full year margins.", "Switching to Industrial, revenues were up 9.5% in the quarter reflecting higher volumes in each of our businesses as well as the acquisitions of Sherman & Reilly and HD Electric at Greenlee. For the year, we posted a 60 basis point improvement in margins on 3.9% revenue growth.", "Looking to 2014, we are expecting continued margin expansion resulting from solid top-line growth driven by strong auto markets and our continued investments in new products sales and distribution capabilities.", "Moving now to Bell, plant productivity and execution across our programs improve and that was reflected in our sequential margin recovery in the quarter. We delivered 13 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 75 commercial helicopters, versus 9 V-22s, 6 H-1s and 65 commercial helicopters in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. During the quarter, the V-22 program was approved which contributed to an increase in overall Bell backlogs.", "On the FMS front, last week the Department of Defense notified Congress that it intends to sell six V-22s to Israel with the aircrafts expected to be in field in 2016. We continue to pursue a number of additional FMS opportunities for both V-22 and H-1 aircrafts and believe we will have incremental FMS deliveries for both of these platforms.", "On the commercial front, we delivered 213 helicopters for the full year, up 13% from last year\u2019s 188 units, reflecting our investment in the products and increased focus on the commercial helicopter market.", "Looking to 2014, we are expecting a flat top-line at Bell reflecting a decrease in military revenue offset by an increase in the commercial side of business. Margins are expected to be down slightly, reflecting the expected decrease in military margins and continue to back for the manufacturing efficiencies we talked about last quarter.", "Wrapping up, our operations for U.S Cessna we received FAA certification for our new M2 and Sovereign in the last week of December which allowed us to deliver 12 M2s and eight Sovereigns bringing total jet deliveries in the quarter to 62. This compares with 53 units in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "For the year, deliveries were down at a 139 jets compared to 181 last year. Looking towards 2014, while we are not counting on a significant change in overall market conditions, we do expect that full year deliveries of the M2 and the new Sovereign Plus introduction of our new 10 will contribute to increase in overall deliveries which should internally do an improvement in profitability.", "Longer term, we are still expecting overall jet growth to develop as global economies gain momentum and combine with additional new products that are introduced. With our announced acquisition of Beechcraft, we believe we will be in an excellent position to capitalize on the rebound in the business jet and overall general aviation market.", "To wrap up 2013 in Textron Systems, we continued to innovate on the product front including our expanded Commando family of armored vehicles and development of the next generation of the Shadow M2. We continue to increase our international customer base with finalization of a contract to supply Saudi Arabia with precision weapons.", "We also made progress on a variety of product opportunities in international military markets which we expect to lead to a number of orders in 2014. And finally we established new business unit in the growing global aircraft simulation training market.", "At Industrial last year\u2019s 4% top-line growth reflected our continuing investment and expanded distribution in new products such as the new hybrid-powered Bad Boy Ambush iS at E-Z-GO, and the high productivity AR722T diesel turf mower Jacobsen. And our acquisitions of Sherman & Riley and HD Electric demonstrate our commitment to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.", "At Bell, we implemented a new Enterprise Resource Planning system and now the rollout was without issues. We believe the new system will contribute to significant improvements in our manufacturing operations over the next several years. We also introduced our new short light single and continued to expand our focus on commercial markets around the world.", "On the military side, we announced an important new tilt-rotor product, the V-280 Valor and propose that as Bell Solutions from U.S. DODs Future Vertical Lift program.", "At Cessna, in addition to the M2 and Sovereign, we certified the Cessna TTX the world\u2019s fastest certified fixed-gear single-engine aircraft as well as the Grand Caravan EX. Finally in December, we achieved first light of our Scorpion ISR tactical strike aircraft less than two years from when we launched our design program.", "In summary, 2013 was an important year with significant new product introductions, strategic acquisitions and investments in the future of our businesses. To finish with our 2014 guidance, we are projecting an overall revenue increase of about 9% with EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2 to $2.20.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is also expected to increase significantly to a range of $600 million to $700 million. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Manufacturing revenue was up $153 million in the quarter generating an increase in manufacturing segment profit of $26 million.", "Let\u2019s look at how each of the manufacturing segments contributed. Cessna revenues were $923 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $22 million on a year-over-year basis reflecting the increase in jet deliveries partially offset by a decrease in revenues at Citation X and lower caravan deliveries.", "We posted an operating profit of $33 million, up $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily as a result of improved performance reflecting an unfavorable arbitration award recorded in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "At Bell, revenues were up $226 million, primarily due to higher volumes across the business. Segment profit increased $1 million as the impact of higher volumes was largely offset by lower military margins and manufacturing inefficiencies related to prior period labor negotiations and the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.", "At Textron Systems, revenue decreased to $162 million, primarily due to lower volumes. Segment profit increased $4 million as improved performance more than offset the impact of the lower volumes. Industrial revenues were up $67 million and segment profit increased $11 million, primarily due to higher volumes.", "Moving to finance, segment profit was $2 million. Credit quality remained stable with non-accrual accounts at a $105 million flat with the third quarter and 60-day delinquencies were $80 million, $8 million lower than at the end of last quarter. We ended the year with approximately $1.5 billion in receivables with only $185 million remaining in the non-captive portfolio.", "Moving to corporate items, corporate expenses were $57 million, up $43 million from last year reflecting the impact of \u2013 that our higher share price had on compensation expense. Interest expense was $27 million, down $11 million from a year ago primarily reflecting to retirement of our convertible debt earlier in the year. Our tax rate of 23.3% benefited from the impact of lower U.S. income and a number of one-time foreign items.", "Turning now to our 2014 guidance beginning with pension expense and looking at slide 8. Based on bond rates prevailing at the end of 2013, we\u2019ve increased our 2014 U.S. plan discount rate to 5%.", "In combination with 14% returns on planned assets for 2013, unfunded liability of our defined benefit pension plans dropped to $200 million from $1.3 billion a year ago. On this basis, we are estimating 2014 pension cost of about $130 million. This will provide about $45 million in pre-tax year-over-year benefits to the P&L taking into account 2013\u2019s higher cost of our inventories and carried over to 2014 and a portion of this year\u2019s lower cost will be inventories and carried over into 2015.", "Turning to slide 9, R&D is expected to be approximately $490 million or about 3.7% of sales, down from $511 million in 2013. We are estimating CapEx will be about $425 million, down slightly from last year\u2019s capital expenditure of $444 million.", "Flipping to slide 10 which continued to our segment guidance, at Cessna we are expecting about 19% revenue growth reflecting growth in jets and aftermarket with segment margins in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%. At Bell, we are expecting overall revenues will be approximately flat reflecting lower military revenues being offset by higher commercial revenues with expected margins in the range of 12% to 12.5%.", "At Systems, we are looking for top-line growth of about 20% led by higher UAS revenues with segment margins in the range of 9.5% to 10%. At Industrial, we are expecting 10% revenues growth with the expansion of 2014 margins to be 8.25% to 8.75% range. At finance for forecasting segment profit in the range of $5 million to $10 million in 2014 with minimal upside potential from non-captive asset dispositions, now that those assets are de minimus.", "Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 11, we are projecting about $150 million for corporate expense, down from 2013 primarily reflecting lower compensation expense related to change in share price. Our interest expense estimate at about $117 million is down primarily as a result of last year\u2019s retirement of our convertible notes. And next year\u2019s tax rate is expected to be higher at about 31.5% primarily reflecting the discontinuance of the U.S. R&D tax credit and a higher U.S. income mix.", "Looking now at slide 12, our 2014 EPS guidance reflects an increase of $0.35 at the midpoint. Let\u2019s discuss the major elements driving the increase. Tax headwinds decreased EPS by $0.14, lower expected earnings at Finance represented $0.10 headwind. Improved interest expense provides a pickup of $0.01, the absence of last year\u2019s restructuring charge at Cessna adds $0.07 and the benefit of lower pension expense is expected to add about $0.11 per share in 2014.", "And finally the contribution from our underlying manufacturing business is estimated to be $0.40 per share.", "Tom, that concludes our prepared remarks. So we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from the line of John Godyn representing Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you guys for taking my question. First of all, Scott, I was just hoping that now with the past at some time you could talk a little bit about maybe the internal response from the sales force as well as customer response from the announced Beech acquisition?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, I think it\u2019s been overwhelmingly positive and we\u2019ve had a ton of interactions with the Beechcraft customers and I think from their perspective this provides \u2013 uncertainty with a company that\u2019s gone some pretty difficult times. So I think that all the feedback we received has been very, very positive.", "I think the notion at the customer service and support will be stable through the lifecycle of these products on both the Can aero piece which I think people are fairly comfortable with, but in large part the hawker piece with a lot of customers that were concerned about where that would go has given them a great deal of comfort and the fact that it\u2019s now in an ownership structure that\u2019s long-term committed to the business in general aviation market has been received very, very well.", "John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great, that\u2019s very helpful and I was hoping that, in terms of the 2014 outlook, you could elaborate a little bit on the assumptions or expectations underlying Cessna. In particular, kind of the pricing environment that you see next year or this year, is it getting firmer, just trying to understand the $3.3 billion revenue number a little bit better, think the uptick just within the context to the E-Z comp in 2013 struck us a little bit low and so I was hoping that you could elaborate a bit on that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think if you look at the 2014, the comparative, first of all I\u2019d say, the market is still challenging as I said, I don\u2019t think we are expecting any dramatic change in terms of the market dynamic that\u2019s out there. So, pricing for us was roughly flat year-over-year, so I\u2019d say it has more or less stabilized in terms of where the pricing environment is, most of what we are anticipating in terms of growth is really driven by new products.", "So as you look into 2014, obviously we\u2019ve seen very strong demand around the M2 product. The Sovereign did well really at the end of the quarter obviously, the certifications happened very late in the year but will not have a full year of not just the M2 but also the Sovereign of course we are expecting the 10 to certify in the early part of this year.", "So we expect the full year sales in terms of the Citation 10. So, really the dynamic is, new products matter a lot and as we talked about over the last couple of years our \u2013 one of our biggest competitors has been, our installed base have rolled to the new used aircrafts and so as we come out with new products that are differentiated from what\u2019s available out there Interviewer he marketplace in terms of the use, the customer reception has been strong and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving most of our revenue increase in 2014 which is the full year of those new products that have been well received in the marketplace.", "John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and if I could just ask a quick one on Systems, the margin outlook for 2014 suggests the margin expansion versus 2013. I was just hoping you could elaborate on what\u2019s driving that. Thanks a lot.", "Scott Donnelly", "There is two parts that are driving it. One is, we are feeling better about where we stand on our fee-for-service contracts in UAS. We certainly had another challenging year in 2013 really driven by this issue of engine reliability. The indications we are getting from the field now that we have got our Lycoming Build motors out there has certainly been on a positive trend. So we are pretty confident that we should experience better performance.", "It\u2019s still a challenging program and we are booking it as your profit but again we don\u2019t expect to see the kind of impact we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years in terms of losses associated with that program and then the significant piece is that all of that delivery of production TCDL units was really something we originally expected to start delivering in 2013 as a result of the development program. That really moved into 2014 and beyond.", "So, we\u2019ve been building those units. We\u2019ve been ready to ship those units but we continue to see completing the development contract which is the cost plus low margin contract we expect that to happen here in the first half of this year and so you\u2019ll see a positive mix in terms of now, this development program with low development margins you\u2019ll actually see delivery of production units at better margins.", "John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Very helpful, thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Hey, good morning everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Scott, I wondered if you could maybe just elaborate on the comment you just made about not really expecting much of a change in underlying legacy light cabin business jet demand why not what are customers telling you on the ground today? What are the data points you are looking at that you still need to see change, maybe just a little bit more on sort of how things feel and what it can take to finally turn things?", "Scott Donnelly", "This is a tough one, obviously. We\u2019ve been guessing at this for quite a number of years now. The key metrics that we look at obviously continue to be favorable, number of used aircrafts available out in the market continues to go down in terms of both percent and absolute number of aircrafts, so we find that encouraging. The used market has been quite active again and in 2013 in number of transactions.", "Customer activity, lot of the surveys that people do out there say people are more bullish, certainly in the U.S. Although we continue to be concerned about what\u2019s going on around the economies in Latin America and in Europe which are sort of our second and third largest markets classically for those light mid-sized business jets. So, if I looked at our legacy products which are things that we have had in production through the course of the year we are basically seeing a sort of a flattish market in that area.", "Again, that\u2019s an area that we see and are pretty confident about the increased revenue is the fact that we now have full years for some of the new products. But if I look at things like M2s, we know what that is. We did grow our production a little bit about half way through the year because of increased demand for that product.", "We feel pretty good about where we are on our sovereigns and obviously the 10 certifies, we have original backlog around that product as well. So I think that the safe assumption at this stage is to assume that the market dynamic overall is relatively flat to what it was in 2013 and then all the upside or improvements comes from introduction of new products.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So, should we \u2013 when we are looking at total Cessna units, should we have 2014 production up something on a percentage basis, something similar to what you are telling us revenues will be compared to 2013 and then have \u2013 to think about 2015, it\u2019s not really changing substantially from 2014 or can you really not \u2013 is it sort of short-term still that things could really change significantly still later in the year and it\u2019s too hard to say?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, again the assumptions that you make around 2014 on average aircraft pricing and you are going have a mix obviously of M2s which are from a price point obviously towards the lower end of the product range. But you have the 10 and the sovereigns behind. So I think your assumptions are probably not unreasonable in terms of what you think about in terms of unit volumes in 2014.", "We are certainly not \u2013 nowhere near close to 2015 yet, but I wouldn\u2019t try to make any assumptions around the market overall. I guess the only commentary I would make with respect to 2015 is that, we certainly expect to have the latitude in the market for full year of sales in 2015. So again along the same lines that way we are thinking about today, all have been equal, these new products are things that really drive growth and we would certainly expect to see growth in 2015 driven by the introduction of the latitude.", "Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead sir.", "Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton", "", "Good morning guys. Just a few more questions. Let me start with the maybe the XLS. Scott, when do the final assembly in China start for the XLS? And you maybe not expecting that to be a meaningful up tick XLS deliveries next year or I guess this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "We do expect in 2014 that we would make the first deliveries to the joint venture for the XLS just as we did for their caravan in 2013, but yes, they are relatively low unit numbers as we are just starting to ramping up that process and working the first couple aircrafts through it. So, we are still in the process of business licenses and starting to generate sales activity in China through that joint venture.", "Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton", "Okay, got it. And then, can you maybe give us more detail on what Cessna aftermarket growth finished up at in 2014 and what\u2019s your assumption is in 2014 and similar question on pre-owned volumes?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the aftermarket was up again at Cessna in the aftermarket. It wasn\u2019t up quite as much as it was in the third quarter. But it was a pretty strong quarter in terms of aftermarket growth. The utilizations have held pretty steady. So that business continues to do well in terms of used aircraft. The dynamic that we saw was still very active market and we certainly saw more aircrafts \u2013 a net reduction in our inventory of aircrafts as we sold more than we took in trades.", "Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton", "It seems like 2014, revenue from pre-owned, are you expecting that to be down or maybe just directionally give us a sense?", "Scott Donnelly", "That\u2019s probably relatively flat. It was up this year \u2013 year-over-year but I would say, probably relatively flat next year.", "Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton", "Got it. Okay, thanks guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Carter Copeland representing Barclays. Please go ahead.", "", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "Good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick ones. On the Bell margin outlook for 2014, I know the sequential improvement in the fourth quarter but I was wondering why that was \u2013 what was behind the down year-over-year number there? Is that was just the V-22 in the fourth quarter? Or if that was anymore ERP bleed over from 2013? Any color there would be helpful.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, certainly some of it was a bleed over from the earlier quarter in 2013. So as those inefficiencies that we had which we talked about in the largely impacting the second and third quarter, a fair amount of that stuff cost that was inventory which then will bleed out.", "So it\u2019s certainly sold as we recognize revenues on aircrafts in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll see that as we continue our way through 2014 as well. In terms of real-time operations, we have seen improvements in terms of some of that productivity but we still have a long way to go and continue to drive better margins.", "Obviously, the other dynamic that we have which had some impact in the quarter and will have continuing impact on a go-forward basis is that we are now transitioning into lots of aircrafts that have been negotiated at lower rates than we were achieving in our earlier multi-year contract as a result of accumulated productivity over a period of a number of years.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "Correct. And I wondered if you could just clarify the UAS commentary earlier. You weren\u2019t expecting to book, are you not booking profits at all or you are just not booking losses, is that the right clarification?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, on the fee-for-service we book that at zero profit.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "And your expectation for 2014 is that that will stay that way through the course of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "That\u2019s correct. Our expectation is that we will say that way but we will not recognize any further losses on the program.", "Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays", "Okay, great. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky \u2013 Citigroup", "Hey, good morning everyone. Frank, I was wondering if you could just help us a little bit with the cadence of revenues throughout the year both at Cessna and its systems, just wondering if the seasonality at Cessna is perhaps going to be a little bit front-end in the past in light of the new deliveries and then the cadence that systems will be helpful given the revenues outlook quite a bit. Just getting a sense of when we are going to see an acceleration of revenues there?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, I think you\u2019ll see the same type of seasonality that you have seen at Cessna. It will be impart impacted a little bit by the timing of the certification of the tens which is either a late first quarter or second quarter event. But you will see kind of the same type of back-end strength relative to front-end at Cessna. And at systems, because we expect the TCDL deliveries to be second-half oriented, you\u2019ll see seasonality there as well where the second half of the year will be substantially stronger than the first half of the year.", "Jason Gursky \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great. And then just two quick follow-ups. Actually, how much is the R&D tax credit where \u2013 is it that would have sold back in and then the second question is just the R&D trajectory for the enterprise overall beyond 2014 just general trends on up or down relative to 2014 would be helpful.", "Frank Connor", "Jason, on the R&D credit, I\u2019ll get back to you on offline. We don\u2019t have that number right in front of us.", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Yes, on the overall R&D it will be program specific at the end of the day in terms of what we are looking at. But I think, in and around these types of R&D levels with some probably modest growth is what you should expect.", "", "Jason Gursky \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead sir.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Scott, can you help on Cessna, given your comments on 2014 growth. I was wondering how much of this is actually in the back half already? Do you have any remaining slots for customers at the moment or are these pretty much sold out on the \u2013 shifted to \u2013 let\u2019s say legacy models that is still for sale?", "Scott Donnelly", "No we have some slots. The M2 as I said earlier, we actually added some production capacity. So we created some slots, so we do have aircrafts that are available for sale this year. Sovereign there are aircrafts that are available. We have some of the backlog and some that will be still be sales that need to convert orders. So our orders to sales in 2014 the tens are pretty well sold to this point. There is probably a couple that could be available in the latter part of the year. So the new product side is \u2013 has pretty reasonable backlog in terms of sales.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Okay, and then secondly on Bell, you mentioned you turned up your contract there. There are some FMS sales floating around. Has this had any impact though on your clarity for 2015 or is it likely be a further added like 2015 and 2017.", "Scott Donnelly", "2015 is fairly well set, just in terms of, if you look at lead times frankly, any aircraft deliveries and the V-22 slighted for 2015 will already have had been in production. So I think the 2015 numbers that we\u2019ve provided you guys will hold where they are that\u2019s probably also true at this stage of the game in 2016. So when you see something like the Israeli deal, where they want to take deliveries in 2016, those are units that are actually coming out of the marine core and V-22 stream and so, as the decisions get made in terms of the government about how they want to treat those aircrafts, they are going to add additional that would probably at this point be something that would be a 2017 delivery in terms of any incremental volume opportunities.", "Robert Stallard \u2013 Royal Bank of Canada", "Thanks, so much.", "Operator", "We have a question from Cai Von Rumohr representing Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company", "So, get us a little color on Cessna\u2019s profit looked a little bit light, was there anything in terms of R&D being higher, higher used aircraft losses in the fourth quarter because the incremental margin looks like at 16% relative to the third quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, on a big piece that is, with the certifications both the M2 and the Sovereign we had a lot of cost around the certification and frankly and awful lot of variants in our manufacturing side because of a lot of updates and configurations. We are building these aircrafts and went through certification that was nothing huge but there was a fair bit of a rework that went on to get those into the certification standard. So those are cost that we bore in, in the fourth quarter and of course we also had the citation 10 certification program going in those suite as well. So, it was primarily driven around cost associated to those certifications as well as a fair bit of higher cost associated with the manufacturing efficiencies of having to upgrade and modify those aircrafts as we went through the process.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Got it. And then, you\u2019ve indicated that R&D would be 490 in this year down from 511. Were the certification cost included in the R&D in 2013 and what kind of trend should we expect at both Cessna and R&D in 2014?", "Scott Donnelly", "If you look at R&D, Cai, obviously we don\u2019t break the sales, business-by-business, but it\u2019s safe to say that the majority of the reduction on a year-over-year basis is coming out of Cessna and that\u2019s because we did have an awful lot of R&D cost this year associated with the pack that we are doing the M2 and the Sovereign and the 10 certification programs simultaneously. Obviously, as we go into 2014, we still have to complete the certification on the 10, although the majority of that I would say is behind at this stage of the game, but we still have the spending associated with the latitude program and complete the latitude design development and getting into the flight test and that certification program on that front. So, most of that R&D reduction at a corporate level really is coming out of Cessna and it\u2019s just a function of we rarely have had a time on that. I am not sure we\u2019ve ever had a time, but we\u2019ve had that many parallel certification programs that we\u2019ve been undertaking. And again it wasn\u2019t just on the jet business but also on the prop business.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company", "So, help me understand you are talking about a 400 basis point improvement year-over-year at Cessna and it looks like we get a 100 out of the severance charge, we get close to a 100 out of pensions, we got something out of R&D. So it doesn\u2019t looks like you are giving yourselves any credit for the higher volume. Am I missing something there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think if you looked at the sort of the mid-point of the guidance as you are moving to next year, the leverage in terms of the incremental margin to that revenue is going to be in the low to mid-20s.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay, and then you had mentioned that there is a $45 million positive P&L swing in 2014 in pension expense versus it looks like a $96 million decline in pension cost. Could you give us for 2013 and what you are looking forward for 2014 the actual pension expense that will flow through \u2013 that will be in the P&L?", "Scott Donnelly", "I am not sure we have that exact number. On an year-over-year basis it\u2019s about $45 million and of course the charge or the cost as we outlined on our schedule just $130 million.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company", "So we are ongoing with this, you are only picking up half of the decline in the cost this year and Frank alluded to the fact that the inventories flow through, should we expect the other $50 million or so to flow through in 2015 if all the assumptions remain the same?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, so, Cai, the math behind it is, we tend to inventory about a third of the pension cost differential that then gets realized in the subsequent year and so we have the benefit of the step down in 2013 to 2014 and we\u2019ll get two-thirds of that benefit flowing through in 2014 but we will continue to have one-third of the headwind that we had from 2012 to 2013 that was inventory and therefore will be realized in 2014 P&L. So, that\u2019s the net $45 million. If you then roll into 2015, assuming that we don\u2019t have any further change in downward trend in discount rate or negative rates or something, we will realize the remaining one-third of this year\u2019s benefit and then we will not have \u2013 we\u2019ll have whatever the subsequent impact is to that following year. So, we are kind of making up for the headwind two years ago in part this year and then in 2015 it should trend even better assuming things stay on track the way they happen.", "Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And next we will go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Hi, yes, just following-up on Cai\u2019s question Scott, why shouldn\u2019t the incremental margins be closer to 30% at Cessna kind of versus the low to mid 20 this year, low 20 that you are suggesting on the call.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, George, because they are not. I mean, as we go through the numbers and we look at where we are in the market, you take into consideration the mix of the new products legacy products, where we are in terms of pricing in the marketplace. That\u2019s where we end with the incremental that are kind of at the midpoint down there in the \u2013 I think it\u2019s around 23% if you take the midpoint of the guidance. So if we see, obviously, if we see some better volume if we see the change in the market. I think there is upside to that. But we have to see some strengthening in that light to mid-sized market but as we came through 2013 and just the dynamic that we saw which was much softer than we would have expected in 2013. The impacts in terms of \u2013 which is sure volume and pricing was quite challenging and so we factor that into our expectations for 2014.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay, and then a follow-up on your comment there. If you looked at the orders I mean we saw a big improvement in the third quarter another big improvement this quarter were the orders really were up like 30% plus in the third quarter and certainly the best since 2008. So why wouldn\u2019t that suggest that the markets actually really beginning a big pick up here?", "", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, we\u2019d like to think that and carry over to 2014, but again, George, if I go back to the latter part of 2012, we certainly thought there was some momentum that we are going to see coming into 2013 and we didn\u2019t see that. As a result, we ended up with production schedules and such that we are a lot more difficult than we would have expected and so I think we need to continue as we go into 2014 despite having seen what was certainly a good quarter in terms of order activity that we are going to continue to view that the strength will be around the new products and that it will still be a challenging overall market and therefore the legacy products will be under the same sort of pressure that they were in 2013.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Okay, and then just one quick one on Systems, the revenue guidance you gave is a lot higher than what I would have expected. I know in your commentary you went through some of the things, I mean, is there one or two programs that are substantially increasing at that point in time and what\u2019s the mix between international and domestic that you would expect in the 2014 guidance?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, the biggest driver in the Systems revenue growth in 2014, George, is around this TCDL program. So we should complete \u2013 it will be relatively back-end loaded. We will probably complete the development programs which includes an army test which will happen in the second quarter. So, you won\u2019t get sign-off on the development side until probably late in the first half of the year. So that means all that production delivery will be in Q3 and Q4. Most of those assets by the way are manufacturers. So, there is \u2013 but there is not an operational risk in terms our ability to deliver on that. It\u2019s just a matter of getting through the development program. So that will be all be third and fourth quarter but it is a significant increase in revenue over 2013 and then there is about probably $90 million to $100 million and they are incremental revenues associated with the acquisitions of Mechtronix and OPINICUS in the simulation and training business.", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "And then Scott, what was the mix between international and domestic in 2014?", "Scott Donnelly", "In the systems?", "George Shapiro \u2013 Shapiro Research", "Yes.", "Frank Connor", "I don\u2019t think we would expect a big changer because we\u2019ve got the growth in the TCDL unit there, but we are still on track to get that near 50% in 2015, George.", "Scott Donnelly", "TCDL, George obviously is all \u2013 that\u2019s all U.S. army. So that\u2019s going to see our number a little bit and that that\u2019s sort of demand which would have been split over several years will all be domestic. But if you look beyond that in terms of our orders and our new business activity it is still biased towards the international marketplace, which as Doug said in this year \u2013 in 2015 you are looking at more like a 50-50.", "Frank Connor", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks, good morning. Scott, just on the mid-sized aircrafts, it seems like you had a decent quarter in particular. XLS really picked up and then some of that timing relative to Q3. Also it seems like the sovereign adds some little more traction is that a fair statement that you try not to get ahead of yourself but things are looking a little better there?", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Well, it was certainly a good quarter in that respect Joe and obviously the introduction in the sovereign helped aircraft available for sale in the fourth quarter and now we\u2019ll have that available for sale throughout 2014 and we do expect good performance on that platform. The XLS did very well in Q4 that was obviously some timing associated around that. But again, as we look at our forecast for 2014 we are assuming that legacy aircrafts and the XLS certainly fits that category and so it\u2019s a great airplane and it continues to do well in the marketplace. But we are expecting the dynamic for the total year of 2014 to be very similar to what we experienced in 2013 which was pretty soft until we got into that fourth quarter.", "", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. And then just one other, on the cash flow, Frank, just looking into 2014, what are the key working capital assumptions to the $600 to $700, in particularly what are you assuming add-ins within the category at Bell and Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, the working capital is about flat. So there is no real change in working capital. We would expect it \u2013 we will continue to see some inventory improvement at Bell and Cessna here earlier in the year. And so we are always going to be seasonal from a cash flow standpoint but better seasonality, certainly than we saw last year, but kind of given our expectations that those businesses will continue to show out year growth we\u2019d expect then some kind of reversal of that that you will see later part of the year as we build into 2015 kind of particularly as we get ready for instance for the latitude launch and then other new product launches. So, kind of overall flat with some dynamic around seasonality during the year.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "And what was the \u2013 can you quantify, versus maybe your expectations a year ago. The inventory build in those two businesses during 2014. how much that caused you, just in terms of Cessna deliveries not meeting your original expectations and then the issues you had at Bell.", "Scott Donnelly", "Joe, I think from a straight working capital management standpoint between the sort of the overbuild at Cessna part of which obviously liquidated in the fourth quarter but not fully to where we would like to have been. We had a couple of hundred million dollars of working capital different than where we would like to have been and I think what Frank is saying, is as we go through 2014 we certainly expect that we will address that issue and that we will fix that working capital problem, but it is going to be pressured as we get into the latter part of next year particularly around Latitude. We done our first engine on that aircraft. It should be flying here very soon and we\u2019ll be into the flight test program and driving towards certifications early in 2015 obviously to get a full year sales in 2015 means we are going to go ahead and turn that production line on. So we\u2019ll be building out those aircrafts but we won't be able to sell those aircrafts, deliver those aircrafts until that certification happens. And so that will happen probably in the very early part of 2015 but we\u2019ll be carrying a full production line with revenues. So I think we have a plan on how we are going to address. So what I would as the overall working capital mix in 2013 but we are going to be pressured around some of the inventory particularly around the latitude at Cessna in 2014.", "Joseph Nadol \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", " ", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Julian Mitchell representing Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thank you. I think it\u2019s clear you are not going to change your incremental margin guidance on Cessna based on the last 15 questions. But I guess if you look at the \u2013 I just want to focus on the impact of the ramp up of the new jet. So how does that affects the incremental of Cessna, sort of year as a whole in 2014 and in particular in the first half. So I guess you have some better pricing but then at the same time you have got costs associated with the ramp up maybe some fixed cost on absorption early on.", "Scott Donnelly", "Actually, and that\u2019s what \u2013 I think, Cai and George\u2019s questions are good. I mean, it\u2019s easy to \u2013 we can go through some of the beneficial things that should be flowing through the P&L and try to justify a higher number and I guess the bottom line is while we expect and the new products like the M2 and the Sovereign are good in delivering good gross margin in terms of product lines, there are no issues associated with those recurring cost on the programs but as we have introduced and you ramp these new products we have had inefficiency this year around the models we made go into certification. We would expect some of that will bleed off obviously as we go through the beginning of the new year, but the real issue here is that, despite those better volumes and fairly good confidence with respect to new product programs we think that the pricing environment the challenges in the legacy product given the dynamics in the marketplace, it\u2019s still going to be pretty tough and so as we factor that in. That\u2019s where we end up with the guidance number that we are giving you guys and we would over to see that be the better number and if we see some turn in the market I think we can make that happen but we were kind of burned by the going from 2012 into 2013 and so I think we are going to be very conservative about our perspective of what the overall market is doing as we go from 2013 to 2014.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sure and then, within Cessna off the market, it sounds like you think, this will be a pretty flattish demand here. I guess if you kind of activity take-offs and landings and so when you got some better news I guess particularly in markets like Europe versus the nine or twelve months ago the U.S. is pretty stable. I just wonder why it is you think the market is be kind of flattish.", " ", "Scott Donnelly", "I think the commercial be up a bit at Cessna but \u2013 I mean the fleet does continue to grow a bit ADUs in the US have been quite stable kind of 0.68, 0.67 as we\u2019ve grown through the \u2013 as to what happens in the European markets or the Latin American market, I think there is \u2013 it\u2019s still bit of a wild card. But we are assuming low to mid-single-digit growth in the service business on a year-over-year basis.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Got it. Thanks and lastly just on Systems. You got a pretty healthy profit increase in for 2014. Is that\u2019s something we should see straight off from the beginning of the year, or you think there will be some lumpiness around that?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it will be more back-end loaded, Julian, again primarily driven by the fact that the dynamic on the UAS business is transitioning from this development program which is a very low margin program to the delivery of the production programs which are reasonable and normal production sort of margins. But all those deliveries will be in the third and the fourth quarter of the year.", "Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague representing Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple quick follow-ups. Scott, has there been any change in just the tenor of order activity around actually getting the sorts is that something really \u2013 to a significant degree for the sales effort or not really.", "Scott Donnelly", "You don\u2019t know \u2013 Jeff, I don\u2019t think the dynamic and people knew they were coming and very close communication with customers for quite some time in terms of the status of those things that the fact that it happened so late in the year, probably cut a few aircrafts out that we would do. Otherwise I have expected to get delivered, but that was just more around \u2013 it became such a compressed schedule right there at the end to just try to physically make the transition happen obviously we got a quite a few aircrafts sold in a very short period of time. I mean, essentially, of course the book showing the 28. So that one with window we are able to title and transfer 20 aircrafts between M2s and sovereigns. So, but I think it had happened earlier in the quarter, clearly there was an opportunity that we would have sold a few more aircrafts. I would say in terms of on a go forward basis, Jeff, it\u2019s a biggest issue that will drive orders and backlog particularly as we look into 2015 is getting the latitude flying. So that aircraft, once it starts being able to demo the aircraft that will start to generate some order momentum and we saw that on the Sovereigns M2. So once you have aircrafts that are out flying and able to do some demonstration and get up to shows and get it around the customers, you do need to have that to start generating the order momentum.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Great, but I\u2019m just wondering on Bell, anything to be aware of their margin trajectories flows out over the year, and second the carryover inventory cost on the labor disruptions plus as we roll into the multi-year is there any \u2013 the new multi-year is there any long lead time stuff that weighs on margins in 2014 as we start the kind of movement to 2015?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think we are probably a little more pressured in the early part of the year. In part we are recognizing now some of these lower margin military programs, particularly in the H1s some V-22 pressure as you move through the course of the year. But because more of o our volume is going to be dependent on the commercial business. Now as you know that commercial does tend to \u2013 from a seasonality standpoint tend to be loaded more towards the latter half of the year and particularly a lot of the larger helicopter programs which tend to be the larger generator of profits in terms of the overall mix will be more skewed towards the back of the year. So, it\u2019s going to be not a wild swing, but I would say will be more pressured in the earlier part of the year on a Bell margin that we would be in the third, fourth quarter.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay, but for the multi-year that extended work expecting a step-down in 2015 we really feel that calendar 2015 and V-22 margins there is no kind of no early lead time stuff that starts to impact 2014.", "Scott Donnelly", "Now because, we do this when we recognize revenue. Now we do have some aircraft that will be delivered in the fourth calendar year of 2014 which is under that FY 2015 government calendar. So there will be some multi-year to deliveries and that will be in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay, and then just finally on V-22, at this point it\u2019s still unclear but you would expect that the U.S. government makes the marine whole and the six unit that are going to the Israel that ultimately be made hold somewhere later in the program?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, that\u2019s certainly the marine course\u2019s expectation, I would just caveat that was subject to all the budget stuff that\u2019s going on. I think that remains to be definitized.", "Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners", "Okay, thanks for color Scott.", "Operator", "We have a question from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks, I did have just a couple follow-ups, one on Bell first. Can you give us a sense of the total revenue you have there with respect to the refurb and aftermarket services that the army does that stand down their fleet?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, if you look at the program, in total it\u2019s typically a little under $100 million a year of revenue between refurbishments, new cabin builds, spare parts and service.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And probably a little better than or better than the Bell average I would imagine?>", "Scott Donnelly", "No, it\u2019s probably about normal, if you look those total mix between new builds and spare parts.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay and the other follow-up was, you talked about the second half systems deliveries and just wanted to confirm, is that expectation in the backlog today or it\u2019s in the plan but we are waiting for it to land in the backlog? I\u2019m just curious in terms of the visibility?", "Scott Donnelly", "I am sorry, which program?", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On the second half systems\u2026.", "Scott Donnelly", "Oh, yes, I am sorry. No, we had those programs, those contracts have been in-house for quite sometime and as I said, the units have actually been manufactured. So, it\u2019s just we haven\u2019t done condition because we can\u2019t transfer title until after we\u2019ve completed the development piece which is a separate contract. But we actually have two separate production contracts that we already have in-house for the production units of TCDL.", "Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, perfect. Thanks.", "Frank Connor", "", "Operator, before we go to our final or follow-up call, I just wanted to clarify on the question from Jason relative to the R&D tax credit that, in 2013 we had about $11 million of a tax credit related to 2012 plus another $15 million remain related to 2013. Obviously that is now taken on in terms of our 2014 tax rate. So with that we will take our final call operator.", "Operator", "All right, our final question today will come from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton", "Yes. Scott, just on the Bell commercial helicopter outlook I know you said, it\u2019s up for 2014 that\u2019s your expectation, but we had kind of a blow out this year particularly on the 407 and 429 was very strong. I am just wondering what is giving you the confidence that those that continue to see growth in 2014 on the Bell commercial side if it\u2019s primarily oil and gas or if you see other end-markets improving as well.", "Scott Donnelly", "You know, it\u2019s really been the growth and our order book has really been across the board. So oil and gas has been strong. Emergency medical service has been quite good and as I said, we\u2019ve seen significant growth in the 40. Now the 407GX product has done extremely well in the marketplace and have been very competitive and I expect we\u2019ll continue to see that the 429. Volumes have been up and we expect to see those volumes up again. The receptivity of the product particularly with the extra 500 pounds which we\u2019ve seen approved in many markets around the world we are still working on that with the FAA for the US market. But most markets outside of US and Europe have given the additional 500 pound gross weight increase and that product is doing extremely well in a very broad range of markets. So, the strength in terms of what\u2019s going on in the helicopter market has been good and our share as a result of the new product has been growing.", "Peter Skibitski \u2013 Drexel Hamilton", "Very good. Thanks very much.", "Frank Connor", "Okay that concludes our call for today. Thanks for joining us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay starting at 10:00 a.m. this morning and running through April 15, at midnight.

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone. Before we begin I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "On March 14, we completed our acquisition of Beechcraft combining it with Cessna to create a new segment called Textron Aviation. Therefore our first quarter results include the impact of the acquisition including 16 days of operating results. On this basis Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were 2.8 billion of approximately flat with the first quarter of 2013. Income from continuing operations was $0.31 per share compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of \u201913.", "As shown on slide 4 of the earnings presentation the net impact of the Beechcraft acquisition during the first quarter was a reduction to EPS of $0.05 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $111 million use of cash compared to $425 million use of cash in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "First quarter pension contributions were 17 million and with that I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Thanks Doug. Good morning everybody. Revenues in the quarter were up at our new Textron Aviation segment and across all of our industrial businesses. Overall manufacturing revenues were approximately flat as lower volumes of Textron Systems and Bell offset the higher revenues at aviation and industrial.", "At Bell we delivered eight V-22s and five H-1s compared to nine V-22s and six H-1s in last year\u2019s first quarter. On the commercial side we delivered 34 aircraft down from 48 a year ago reflecting timing of deliveries. Order demand was stronger than a year ago so we still expect commercial deliveries will be up in 2014. We had a very good show again this year\u2019s HELI-EXPO in early March highlighted by the unveiling of our new Bell 505 Jet Ranger X. We received nearly 200 customer commitments during the show for the 505 reflecting stronger customer interest in this entry level helicopter.", "At HAI, we also featured our new 525 Relentless which we displayed in the search and rescue configuration. We received our first 525 letter of intent at the show for delivery of 10 units from Abu Dhabi Aviation.", "They plan to deploy these units in support of a variety of missions including offshore oil and gas, emergency medical services, VIP transport and search and rescue. Bot the 525 and 505 were on track for first flight by the end of this year with expected entry into service in 2016. During the quarter we also expanded the capability of our 429 product as we received Canadian and Brazilian certification of a retractable wheeled landing gear version of the aircraft which provide significant operational flexibility for our customers. We also participated in the Singapore airshow where we displayed our 407GX and 429 commercial offerings and on the military side we had an H-1Z and a V-22. We also had a number of positive developments in the Asia-Pacific region as we established a new sales office in Japan and announced the sale of eight 412s for the Philippine Department of Nation Defense and booked eight helicopter orders in China with options for seven more.", "Finally we were named number one in helicopter services support for the 20th consecutive year at ProPilot magazine. Aftermarket support is a key competitive differentiator in the vertical of market and we will continue to invest and work to expand our support capabilities around the world. Moving next to Textron Systems revenues were down as expected but we had a good program performance for segment margins of 10.7%. We continue to make progress on the Shadow TCDL upgrade development program and we\u2019re on track to deliver production units beginning in the third quarter.", "We\u2019re also seeing continued performance improvements in our Aerosonde fee-for-service platform reflecting the successful deployment of Lycoming manufactured engines into the installed fleet for which we now have achieved over 10,000 hours of operation.", "Earlier this month our new aircraft Simulation and Training business participated in the World Aviation Training Conference where we launched our new name and brand through simulation training. This reflects our mission to ride [ph] realistic pilot environments for true to life ensuring pilots are fully experienced, competent and confident when they leave our simulators.", "Shifting to Industrial, we saw a good growth of Caltex reflecting strength in Asian and European auto markets. We also continue to win new platforms at Caltex which bodes well for continued long term growth. E-Z-GO also continued to grow as top line based on new products. We have been rolling out across our golf, consumer, commercial and aftermarket product lines. At Greenlee, growth is driven by continued market share expansion and our acquisitions of Sherman & Reilly and HD Electric last year.", "We\u2019re currently pursuing new electric utility transmission sales opportunities with the 12 city roadshow to demonstrate a new product line up, highlighting how our products can support our customers health, safety and productivity. Also in the acquisition front we added in important new product line at Jacobsen during the quarter with purchase of Dixie Chopper, a U.S. manufacturer of zero-turn radius mowers. Expands our product offering to better serve the commercial and municipal market sectors.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, with the acquisition of Beechcraft we delivered our first eight King Air\u2019s during the last two weeks of the quarter. We also delivered 35 new jets up from 32 a year ago. We were pleased that even at these relatively low volumes we were able to generate a $22 million year-over-year improvement in segment profit in the quarter. On the new product front our Latitude prototype took first flight on February the 18th and followed on February the 25th, the demonstration of its maximum flight envelope. This included reaching a maximum speed of 440 knots or mach 0.8 and going on a direct climb to a maximum altitude of 45,000 feet with a maximum gross take off to 29,000 pounds. ", "We continue to make progress towards the 2015 entry into service for the Latitude. We also announced the new CJ3 plus which includes a state of the art fully integrated Garmin 3000 avionics suite, a redesign cabin and cockpit and new pressurization diagnostic systems. We also introduced CJ2 plus Alpine Edition, our Garmin 3000 cockpit upgrade option for existing CJ2 plus owners.", "Finally Cessna achieved a noble milestone during the quarter as our installed fleet of 6600 citations reached over 30 million total flight hours of service. With the Beechcraft acquisition we now have a global customer base, operating over 9000 business jets as well as over 9000 turboprops and over 180,000 piston engine aircraft.", "With respect to Beechcraft we\u2019re estimating Beechcraft will add about 1.5 billion in revenue to the aviation segment this year. This reflects an expectation for higher aftermarket revenue, lower military sales and slightly fewer King Air\u2019s this year as we believe 2015\u2019s volume is benefited from catch-up deliveries related to the uncertainties leading up to the Beechcraft bankruptcy. Therefore our 2014 revenue guidance for Textron Aviation is now 4.8 billion.", "In terms of synergies, we began implementing restructuring activities last week and now estimate we will spend about 35 million in 2014 and reach an annualized cost synergy run-rate of about 80 million by the end of this year. On this basis and including the impact of purchase price accounting right up to amortization, we estimate the acquisition will add about 45 million net to Textron Aviation segment profit this year. Therefore segment margin guidance for the year remains at 2.5% and 3.5%.", "To give you a sense of the earnings power the segment going forward after adjusting for purchase price accounting items and giving benefit to full year synergies and fully annualized results. 2014 Textron Aviation margins would be about 200 basis points higher than the midpoint of our current guidance range.", "While our restructuring process will not conclude by the end of the year we believe we will be able to offset any 2015 cost with additional savings and remain comfortable with our previous statement that we expect the Beechcraft acquisition will be accretive by $0.25 to $0.30 per share on a fully annualized basis.", "To wrap up we believe we\u2019re off to a good start on the year; we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in terms of demand in the majority of our markets. We continue to make progress with operational productivity, our strategy in investing new products and distribution is paying off and we\u2019re seeing good results from our M&A investments.", "With that I will turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "", "Thank you Scott. Good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was 219 million down 16 million from the first quarter of 2013 on approximately flat revenues. Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up 77 million from this period last year reflecting a 101 million of acquired Beechcraft revenue, higher jet, Caravan and aftermarket volume partially offset by a reduction in preowned sales and CitationAir revenues.", "The segment had a profit of 14 million compared to a loss of 8 million a year ago. This reflected favorable pricing and higher jet and Caravan volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at 1.5 billion up 503 million from the end of 2013. This includes a $534 million contribution from Beechcraft. Moving to Bell, revenues were down 76 million on lower commercial unit sales and decreased B-22 and H-1 deliveries partially offset by higher V-22 product support.", "Segment profit decreased 33 million from the first quarter in 2013 primarily reflecting the overall volume and unfavorable commercial aircraft mix as we delivered only two 412s in the quarter. At Textron Systems revenues were down 66 million reflecting lower UAS and TMLS volumes offset by higher weapons and sensor volume. Segment profit increased 1 million despite lower volumes reflecting favorable performance across most product lines.", "Industrial revenues increased 70 million reflecting higher automotive volume and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased 9 million due to the higher volumes. Moving to finance revenues in segment profit were down 13 million and 15 million respectively reflecting the impact of gains on the disposition of finance receivables during 2013.", "Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at 98 million down 7 million from the end of 2013 while 60 day delinquencies were a 125 million up 45 million in the quarter.", "Lastly moving to corporate items, corporate expenses were 43 million and we believe we\u2019re still on track for a full year amount of about a 150 million. Interest expense was 35 million down from 37 million a year ago reflecting the retirement of our convertible debt in May of last year partially offset by 7 million in interest cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing.", "Our tax rate was 30.4% reflecting a number of discreet non-U.S. benefits in the quarter. We\u2019re still estimating a full year tax rate of about 31.5%. During the quarter we repurchased 4.3 million shares through an accelerated repurchase program. This should result in a four year average share count of about 283 million shares. Looking then to our full year outlook as shown on slide 5, we estimate that Beechcraft will reduce 2014 EPS by about $0.08 per share.", "On this basis the company now expects 2014 earnings per share from continuing operations will be in a range of a $1.92 to $2.12 per share. Cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions is still expected to be in a range of 600 million to 700 million. This reflects an approximate cash neutral net operating impact from the Beechcraft acquisition. That concludes our prepared remarks. So Greg we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of John Godyn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Scott, I was hoping now that we've had some time to digest Beech that you could talk a little bit more about revenue synergy opportunities. You had some very good commentary on the cost synergy side, it sounds like on a run rate basis the outlook there is that it could exceed some of the prior comments. I'm just curious what the outlook looks like or how it might have evolved on revenue synergies now that you've had some more time?", "Scott Donnelly", "With respect to revenue synergies, it's not something that I want to really put hard number around. We try to base all of our synergy and math around the things we know we can control which is really on the cost side of the equation. I'd also say from a timing perspective here. We've been working pretty hard over the last few months on the cost side of things -- the team has been working together so that we were able to kind of come out of the gate right away executing on the cost synergies.", "Obviously we couldn\u2019t get sales teams together prior to the official closing so those teams are now working. We've got kickoff events and the folks that are in the particular regions that have been selling King Air\u2019s or meeting with the teams that have been selling Citation jets. So we are certainly starting to operate to make sure that we can take advantage of what revenue opportunities or maybe, but it's not something that I would put a number.", "Obviously we feel good about the fact that we now have a huge install base of Hawker jets and these are customers that are very, very important to us. We\u2019re going to reach out to them to work with them on the service front which also will hopefully over time increase our conversion rate or I guess retain those Hawker customers and as they move to a new jet we obviously want to see them move into the Citation jet family and we will do everything to make sure they have a very service experience to help promote that on a go forward basis.", "But it's not something that we're going to come out with any form of real guidance around a specific number on the revenue synergy side.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Outside of a specific number, I mean is it fair to say that directionally now that you\u2019ve had more time looking at Beech and the sales forces are communicating that you feel directionally better about revenue synergy potential as we think about it long term?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think John we always felt that this was an important part of the acquisition and something that would be a great add in terms of adding those additional sales resources and building those relationships and we have only being in to this now for a few weeks. The teams have been getting together, I would say there is a great deal of energy around it, you know each of the sessions -- had around the world where we get these teams together, people are very enthusiastic, very bullish on working together to get out there and just increase our coverage and build more customer relationship. So it was without a doubt an important part of the transaction and I would say so far as the teams we have gotten together we feel very good about it.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "And then I was just hoping that you could elaborate on the general biz jet commentary and specifically what you're seeing with some of the legacy aircraft types. A lot of the data that the analyst community tracks has generally being a looking a bit better. Some people have gotten a bit excited. I'm just curious what your perspective is as you read the tea leaves? Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "So key metrics continue to move in the right direction in terms of used available for sale. You certainly hear some firming around the pricing in the use market which is encouraging. For sure the number of aircraft and we watch this every quarter in terms of Citation fleet and what's available for sale, drop-down another 40 aircraft or so as the install base continues to grow. So I would say in terms of trends of some of those key metrics they are still going in the right direction.", "We feel good about the fact that pricing has firmed in the use market. We feel good about the fact that pricing is incrementally better in the new market as well. So if I had to kind of give overall color on a year-over-year basis as we sat here a year ago we were kind of saying we are little concerned about what we are seeing in the market and we were taking production back and sort of trying to firm pricing and we sit here a year later and while the overall numbers are not a lot higher in terms of unit deliveries we certainly feel better about what's going on in the market and feel a lot more confident about where we're heading here as we into the second, third quarter than we did a year ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Scott, I wanted to ask about pricing. You mentioned -- in the release you have got some pricing on the new models, new model Citations. Just wondering if you've got any pricing on the balance of the Citation portfolio because I know you guys have tried to be a little bit more disciplined on pricing.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes we did Pete and in fact when you see the pricing numbers here they will come out, our pricing was up on a year-over-year basis and that really is a reflection of the legacy models. The M2s and the Sovereigns which were give bit of a volume here in the first quarter aren't going to be in that price number because they are new models. So, the price was certainly up on the existing CJ and XLS families and that number is out there. The M2s and the Sovereigns obviously -- they are new -- will not show up in our pricing number but certainly pricing has been better than we've seen in the past.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "That\u2019s great and then I\u2019m interested in kind of your new expectations for a peak margins at aviation. I mean it's tough to kind of figure out what kind of the go ahead margin rate at Beechcraft would be given it's kind of up and down history and Hawker has wound down but you\u2019ve got $80 million in cost savings you\u2019re looking at. So can you give us some color around you know what peak margin can possibly be for the big aviation segment?", "Frank Connor", "Pete, I have to be honest I haven't tried to do that math yet. We have been sort of focused here on making sure we can communicate to you guys exceptions in terms of what it means here at\u201914 and particularly how to model going into \u201915, in terms of you know peak margins as you know we have always talked about trying to get through a couple 100s basis points better than in the past. That\u2019s obviously a little bit muddied up here because we\u2019re going to have a mix of stuff that we don\u2019t actually really know what the margins were back in those peak days because there was so much noise in all of the financials as Beech went through, the Hawker issue. It is a very complicated model, Pete, so I can\u2019t even really go back and tell you very well an actual real percent to know what to base that peak off of. I know that\u2019s kind of a muddy answer but the math is -- historical numbers always had all kinds of special charges and impacts of things. It's just it's not an easy comparable.", "Scott Donnelly", "I think the way to think about it is in Scott\u2019s earlier comments about the 200 basis points adjustment for kind of a normalized full year run-way of the segment and then you are making your own assumptions on what you think volumes are going to do and what the pricing environment is and I think you can come up with a view of where your margins are going to go.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Okay. Last question should we'd be worried that 412 was down year-over-year and 429 as well?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think Pete, that\u2019s just timing. We had an awful lot of 412s that went out in the fourth quarter just based on customer demand and where they were, so we were very light in the first quarter particularly with respect to 412s which is an important part of the mix commercial business but I don't think that portends anything for the year. It was just a light number deliveries based on customer demand and delivery dates for the first quarter.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "You still think 4.5 billion for Bell for the full year in revenue?", "Scott Donnelly", "That\u2019s correct. Yes, sir.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Just a follow-up, I think you reiterated your Bell revenue guidance there. I was wondering if you could comment on Textron Systems, whether you\u2019re still comfortable with your full-year revenue guidance for that division?", "Scott Donnelly", "We\u2019re trying to stay away from quarterly guidance here but we did try to tell people the real drivers of the revenue growth on a year-over-year basis is driven in large part by the TCDL program which is really going to be a third and fourth quarter program just because that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to be completed the final testing and it should be signed off in terms of starting customer delivery. So we expected the first and frankly expect the second quarter to be pretty light in terms of the revenue line because you won't see those deliveries until the third and fourth quarter.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "And then secondly on the aviation division, I was wondering if you can give us an idea what the sort of lead time is on a new jet at that moment? Whether that started to move out a little bit?", "Scott Donnelly", "It depends on which model. So it has -- got a little bit on some of the models and if you\u2019re interested Robert we will push up as far forward in the list as we could.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "No I was focused more on the ones where you have been operating a bit on a spot basis and whether that\u2019s stretched down a little bit?", "Scott Donnelly", "It's a still spot basis on some of the lighter jets Robert, but as you get into some of the new models like the Sovereigns you\u2019re starting to build -- again not a huge backlog but these aircraft for instance are -- I don\u2019t think we can get to one of those Sovereigns in the second quarter. So we\u2019re kind of at a point where that production line is pretty well matching what the demand is sort of quarter ahead.", "Operator", "We will go to the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "I just wondered in terms of the Beechcraft business, the lumpiness of sort of the margin profile there during the year. I don't know if there's anything particularly important in terms of seasonality that you wanted to call out but obviously the margin number to the extent that it counts for you had in Q1 but very, very high versus the kind of 7% underlying margin guide for the year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I think Julian if you look at the numbers it looks like a very high number because it really just reflects those last two weeks of a quarter and you had a lot of King Air deliveries which is fairly standard I think in this business. You tend to have a fair number of deliveries right near at the end of the quarter. So the margin rate in that two week period looks particularly high but that\u2019s because you had eight deliveries in a two week period of time over a relative short cost base. So I think that\u2019s just a function of the fact that you\u2019re just looking at a snapshot of the last two weeks of the quarter. In terms of sort of a normal annualized looking at the business from what we have seen if its historical numbers it doesn\u2019t look terribly different than the jet business. Deliveries tend to be stronger in the fourth quarter than they are in the second quarter let\u2019s say, but again it doesn\u2019t look to us to be have historically being very different than what we see in the jet business.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks and then on the Bell, I guess you are still sticking with that 12%, 12.5% margin guide for the year as a whole. I just wondered if there's anything in Q1, any spillover in terms of the ERP type stuff that hurt the margins were it really was primarily around the commercial mix and that should come back?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I mean there is both things in there Julian, so for sure as we talked about last year as we went through sort of the challenges on the new ERP system and the labor disruptions. We were running at a higher cost basis than we normally would and a fair bit of that did get inventoried just because it goes and then leaves off over a period of time. So when we gave you the guidance around the margins we did expect that as that inventory went through and burned off over the course of the year that we expect that we would see about a 100 basis point drag on our margin rates through the course of the year and in fact if we look at those things that were -- those additional costs as they flow through in the first quarter it was about 100 basis point drag.", "And so I think you will see roughly a percent of margin degradation in this year\u2019s performance that was a result of those higher cost that we incurred last year but again that was factored into the guidance that we gave you in that 12%, 12.5% number.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks and lastly very quickly R&D to sales. You had indicated alongside the Q4 earnings that should be a tailwind to margins this year, year-over-year, is that still the case?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it's a very slight tailwind and I think it remains that way as we bring Beech and the R&D as a percent of sales is kind of about what it is for the overall Textron Company. So no real change in terms of the overall R&D as a percent of sales and it's a very slight tailwind. It's a little bit wider in Cessna because of the lower numbers of aircraft and certification. It's a bit higher at Bell as we have 525 and 505 and V-280 [ph] all going full tilt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Scott, I wanted to ask a question around the sales force and the aviation segment you've gone through pretty big transformation in there over the last year or 18 months. Was wondering if you could provide an update to us on the benefits, what you've got this far out of that transformation as you move more to a direct sales force? And whether these guys have been to populate some sort of pipeline in this tracking system and what that pipeline looks like on a year-over-year basis.", "Scott Donnelly", "So I think there is no question we have been continue to grow our sales force both domestically and internationally as we have talked about before adding a lot more of our resources as opposed to be dependent on third parties to do that, so we continue to make progress I think in doing that clearly the acquisition of Beech helps, we have added a lot more sales resource through that deal and we have retained that sales force by the way. So I mean there is still a team out there as it was with the Beech very focused on the turboprop marketplace and so as I said earlier we\u2019re having a lot of sort of get to know each other sessions around the world, so that the teams have been out there selling jets and the team is selling turboprops and know each other and can try to find opportunities to work together going forward. But we have largely retained all those folks. So it's increased the net size of our sales force which I think is good.", "I think we have a very good system actually that we use for keeping track of customer contacts and customer opportunities and sort of where people are in the cycle and I would say that\u2019s the system we sort of use and look at it. It's the system we looked at a year ago to say, hey guys we\u2019re not feeling that great about where things are in terms of demand and that\u2019s also the same system we\u2019re looking at today and saying there is a more robust set of customer opportunities out there which makes us feel better about where we\u2019re heading in the second, third quarter. So the system is quite good. The sales teams around the world keep it statused and Scott and that team have a sort of once a week review with all the sales folks around the world on that data basis and kind of get an update on where it is and how things are progressing.", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Scott, do you feel like you've been able to close more deals as a result of this direct sales force than you would have had you've been using an indirect sales force? As you look back, the year 18 months on without a doubt the right move you\u2019ve made?", "Scott Donnelly", "Absolutely. Our indirect, our sales representatives or authorized representatives around the world is like anything, Jason. I think we have had some that have been outstanding and they do a terrific job and we still have a bunch of those and we keep the guys who are doing a great job for us. The thing that was that led us to start to do more of our direct sales around the world is that I think we had too many that were great for us when things were good but when times weren\u2019t good they had other things to go do and obviously when we put a direct person in, good times and bad doesn\u2019t really matter. The person is out there selling every day. They are not going to wait around for the overall market to become positive to go sell. They try to sell all the time and I think that we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "A couple of questions. First Scott can you update us on where the Citation 10 stands, are we going to see deliveries this quarter? I'm not sure I\u2019ve seen whether it's been certified yet?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think our past week was the last week of flight testing and so at this point it's now just into the paper work process and I guess the bottom line George is yes I would expect that the certification will happen this quarter and that you will see initial deliveries of 10s in Q2.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay, and then Frank, just to update if I look back at Beech you projected EBITDA of 215 in the December call. Now it looks like it is gone up a little bit. We are talking 235 maybe, is that due to the 80 million of synergies you are talking now versus 65 before or if I'm wrong if you can clarify what that -- the comparison?", "Frank Connor", "Yes George I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m following your EBITDA comparative but I would say 2013 came in from a historical basis, pretty much on top of what we had expected and the numbers that we\u2019re talking about now are pretty much on top of what we had indicated at the time that we announced the acquisition probably achieving the run-rate synergy saving faster than what we indicated at that point in time. But generally consistent with where we were at the time we made the announcement.", "", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then one last one you had mentioned maybe a 100 basis point impact from the continued labor from the follow-up of the labor issues you had at Bell. Is that more heavily loaded to the first quarter here where the margins were down a lot more or is that just a 100 basis points in the combination of the weaker mix?", "Frank Connor", "That falls across the year. Really as we sell product and it just rolls through cost of sales at a pretty consistent 100 basis points across each quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes so the 100 basis points is pretty consistent, at least the way we forecasted or see it right now, George, the big comparative from \u201913 to \u201914 beyond that is largely driven by mix of principally commercial and largely 412 helicopters in Q1 of \u201913 versus Q1 of \u201914.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "My first question was about, I know you discussed pricing, it seems like there was a bit of a pricing benefit for the full-year just given there is a loss legacy aircraft, can you give us an idea maybe the gross margin differential between some of the newer products like the M2 versus the Mustang?", "Scott Donnelly", "We wouldn\u2019t give those number specifically in numerical Sheila but for sure we\u2019re going to have two dynamics I think through the course of the year. One is that we\u2019re seeing stronger pricing on those legacy aircraft be it Mustang\u2019s, CJ2s, CJ3, CJ4, XLS product lines. I would say on a gross margin basis, you know the things they are not going to be reflected in pricing are going to be the M2s and the Sovereigns and the gross margins on both of those products is good.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Okay. And the first quarter out of the gate, seems like you've been successful with new product launches of their gains and momentum. I know it's a little bit early but looking back historically it seems like new products results in several quarters of market share gains. You have few competitors coming out with new launches in late \u201814 and \u201815. I guess does the sales force have any strategic views on this or how you're thinking about that?", "Frank Connor", "Well I think if you look at the market historically it does, the new products do drive some market and share. We\u2019re certainly seeing that with the M2 and the Sovereign and I would say we see that certainly playing out through the year and I would say right now the business and the sales force I think is very enthusiastic about where the Latitude is. You know that really will be what drives our growth I think in the 2015 timeframe. So as we have kind of said we see the market sort of flattish with respect to demand for the legacy product, so we didn\u2019t make a lot of growth assumption there, most of the growth driven by the introduction of new product. So I came to Sovereign and TEN for the 2014 window and then you add on top of that going into 2015 the Latitude Program which we feel very good about. The flight testing has grown fabulously. We think we\u2019re very much on track for that to having a meaningful impact for us in 2015", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Okay, got it and then just a last one for me. We saw some indications from Congress about the V-22s for carrier usage; can you maybe talk about the potential to expand the V-22 within the U.S. government?", "Scott Donnelly", "We think there is a couple of opportunities that are pretty significantly in the V-22 for it's future. The replacement of the so called carrier onboard delivery vehicle, we think it's a great opportunity. That\u2019s one where there has been a fair bit of work, already conducted by the Marine Corps and the Navy looking at the utility of the V-22 to execute that mission. The issue I think in the long run will really be how they decide to specific that requirement Sheila. So if the mission is just purely to go from a land based airport to a big carrier deck, that\u2019s a fairly narrow mission and there is other ways including refurbishing existing equipment probably to get there. The benefit of the V-22 is you can completely fulfill that mission but you can also go from any land site or any sea site, to any ship because of the vertical takeoff and landing capability of the V-22. ", "So I think it's still too early in terms of where that program is, there is not a hard requirement, you know that\u2019s been written, there is a lot of study and analysis going on within the Navy. So I think that program obviously is still a number of years out but we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned because frankly that aircraft can do things and fulfill the mission in a way that there is -- that no other platform can do it and because it's a production unit and you don\u2019t have a huge development program. We also think it's a much lower risk approach than doing something like an overhaul of older aircraft. So obviously from our perspective we get a lot better value, you get a better mission and you get a lot lower risk but we\u2019re few years from knowing the answer of that question, I think.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura", "Scott I think you mentioned the Sovereign you were booked one quarter out. Can you just give a little color on how that's tracking versus your expectation and your initial plan for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I mean it's basically meeting our plan Shannon. We expected once we got this thing certified and the aircraft was out there and plenty of demo assets for customers to fly it that would drive pretty strong demand and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. So I don\u2019t want to say, hey it's the market is going crazy and you got a line up years in advance or anything like that but the aircraft is doing really well. It's flying very well, the performance has been great. Customers love the new interior, the added range, the more sophisticated capable cockpit. So far it's playing out as we expected. ", "Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura", "Okay. And then just maybe on this ASR you guys did. I guess that's a one-off in the first quarter. I mean any changes, philosophy there and it doesn\u2019t look like it really is much of an impact I guess it offsets dilution?", "Scott Donnelly", "As we said Shannon, clearly we\u2019re committed to making sure that we do as a minimum enough stock buyback to offset the dilutive effects of all the employee programs and that\u2019s really what that was. We just did it in the first quarter to kind of make sure we got the full year benefit of doing that in terms of other buyback opportunities we would continue to look at that on sort of an opportunistic basis. But we will remain committed on a go forward basis, that is the minimum. We will always take out enough to offset dilution.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "", "Just wanted to get my arms around a little bit more Cessna mix for the year and you kind of touched on it a little bit in your comments on the TEN and Sovereign. So if I just look at Q1, right, 130, your deliveries are kind of - M1, M2, Citation 10 start to come in but should we actually expect this quarter to be the high watermark for Sovereign? You are kind of caught up on a little spike and unit volumes really don't rise sequentially from here on Sovereign?", "Scott Donnelly", " They probably won't Jeff; part of this is an artifact of the fact that we certified the airplane so late by the time we got through everything in the fourth quarter. So there were a few Sovereign deliveries that we would have preferred to have made last year and that late certification which couldn\u2019t get through the whole delivery process on a couple of them. So, it's a bit high in the first quarter but we should have reasonable volumes through the balance for the year as well.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Does that apply for M2 also that you had a Q4, Q1 catch up and it levels off or does that work its way higher sequentially over the course of year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think the M2s are fairly stable through the balance of the year.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And then I was just wondering on pricing, from what I can tell it looks like orders were flattish to down slightly book-to-bill's 0.9 or 1 depending on how you round some things. So do you think the better pricing is negatively impacting order intake or am I'm missing something there?", "Scott Donnelly", "No I don\u2019t think so Jeff. I think a lot of it is just timing related, as I said if you look at the amount of activity in the marketplace, the number of customers, sort of just where they are in the order cycle. It's better than where we were before. So as we look -- I mean obviously if it wasn\u2019t a signed order book with a deposit we don\u2019t put it into the backlog but there were a number of deals that were in negotiation and kind of working their way towards contract which has now been closing here as we entered into the beginning of the second quarter.", "So from an order book standpoint in terms of meeting our plan, we think the trend is positive.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And just a quick housekeeping one for Frank. So just looking at in Q1 the $40 million of PT&A step up that\u2019s separate and apart from the $60 million of restructuring and acquisition cost, is that correct?", "Frank Connor", "That\u2019s right and yes we will continue to see that step up will flow through segment profitability and impact the segment for the year and then we also have additional restructuring charges that we will breakout separately, it will be a separate impact.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Scott, just back to Bell and the 412 and the deliveries, I heard you say it was just all timing. Could you speak a little bit though to, and maybe any detail behind that, were there fleet customers that they are transitioning? Is it literally just the dates that the customers want their aircraft and maybe just bigger picture about the demand for that specific model and what's in backlog and what you are seeing?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. I mean it really was just timing Joe. We haven't seen a change in the demand of 412. As you know a lot of times 412s do tend to be fleet orders and we had some fairly strong deliveries just again on timing in the first quarter last year of one of our larger fleet customers that had just scheduled a number of deliveries in Q1. So, as we look through the balance of the year again 412s do tend to come in fleet as opposed to sort of onesie twosies but I think in terms of customer demand fleet orders, customer activities, that\u2019s why we still feel pretty good about the total year 412s.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "And you expect to be, you did 36 last year, you still expect to be higher than that for that model this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sorry Joe, I would have to go and look at my sheets on the exact number of 412s and we don\u2019t usually publish that number but I don\u2019t think it's appreciably different one way or the other. It really is, but our quarter is.", " ", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "And then on, maybe I missed it, but on Beech, what are the cost saves that are actually baked into your guidance now for this year? Not annualized, but actually in the plan here?", "Scott Donnelly", "We haven't given that Joe, and obviously -- I mean first of all we only have nine months. We\u2019re in the process of incurring at this point most of the cost associated with those restructuring activities. So we\u2019re not going to break that as a separate number but we included all that in terms of the numbers we have given you, in terms of restructuring as well as the overall net margin number and so I don\u2019t think we will break that out number separately other than to tell you it's receipt is about an 80 million run-rate for next year.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "I'm just trying to think about the compare going into next year compared to this year how much, I mean we get -- the step-up I assume doesn't recur, you get a full year benefit obviously of EBIT. But then how much incrementally do we get from the cost saves in \u201815 versus \u201814 if we don't know what's in \u201814, it is hard to make that comparison.", "Frank Connor", "That\u2019s part of the overall 200 basis point normalization Joe. So it's part of that.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. Could you actually just run through that again, I heard that number, Frank, but I didn't quite get it in your prepared remarks, the 200 basis points?", "Scott Donnelly", "So if you look at a full year sales impact of Beech and if you look at the impacts that we expect to flow through from the purchase price impacts which are relatively modest going into \u201915 but impact \u201915 by about $65 million and then you look at the expected saving is coming off of that 80 million run-rate that we talked about. You would get on a same volume as 2014, a 200 basis pick up in Textron Aviation margins.", "Frank Connor", "I think gives you all the elements of the number and the reason we\u2019re not trying to obfuscate anything, the reason we are doing it that way is it's hard to identify and will be hard to identify as we move forward here kind of all of the cost savings and where things come from and everything else and we\u2019re really looking as a consolidated segment operations and just trying to focus on kind of what our cost structure will look like in \u201915 and therefore core profitability levels.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Fair enough. And just one more. You've talked Scott quite a bit about demand for some of the individual Cessna models and pricing. I just wanted to touch on something that emerged a little bit last quarter which is the competitive environment in really in the midsize area in particular. Is this something that's getting a little better? You've talked quite a bit in the past about how tough it is out there and I know you don't want to declare victory at all, but is everyone seeing things getting a little better and maybe taking a little more price across the board?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that\u2019s happening Joe. As I said on our legacy product where we compare price on a year-over-year basis, prices are up across the line. So but again it's still a very competitive market. I mean every deal is a fight but I think as we go through that process obviously as demand is firming and a lot of is backed off in terms of how much capacity or what production run-rates are going that\u2019s had the desired effect exactly as we anticipated it would. So we\u2019re starting to see that price firming, having some price firming in the used market, giving people that are out there looking to sell a little bit better collateral value as well as frankly just a stronger market so they can transact and get the liquidity. I mean all those things I think are factoring into just a strengthening in the overall market and therefore you will expect a little bit of strengthening on the pricing side.", "So it's not overwhelming obviously. We would like to see it stronger but it's certainly improved over where we have been and that reflects in some of the improved pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Scott, you had good deliveries of the Sovereign and the M2. Obviously some backlog spillover from the fourth quarter. Should we expect the seasonal pattern here, because of those strong deliveries in the first quarter, that you are really flat to up in the second, flat to up in the third as you burn off that initial backlog, and then a big fourth quarter, is that, as you think about the quarterly pattern, is that the way to think about it?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that\u2019s mostly correct Cai. I mean that\u2019s been sort of the nature of the business, obviously, last year we had very challenging second, third quarters and then a much bigger fourth quarter. We would like to see a flatter profile just in terms of -- it\u2019s a little easier to run the business and little bit more productive to run the business a little bit flatter. But as we look through the course of the year right now we would expect it to be sort of up slightly as we move our way through the quarters incrementally.", "Frank Connor", "We expect deliveries of the TEN to come in here in the second quarter as Scott indicated which will impact things.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Right. But I assume it is later in the quarter if you still have the paperwork to go or are you just all set so you could do you three of them in the quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes and I think we will do several TENs, we have customers that are kind of standing by and ready and wanting these aircraft. The certification -- as we talked about before slid from where we wanted to do it. We would originally like to have done at the end of last year and we just couldn\u2019t get through that in terms of prioritizing getting the Sovereign through the process, flight testing has taken longer than we expected and we have customers that are waiting for their aircraft. So once the paperwork is done we will certainly get a few deliveries here in the quarter.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "So you delivered eight King Airs in the quarter. Can you give the split between the 350, 250s and the 90s, and maybe give us some -- a little more color on where you expect those three models to be for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve the exact number here in front of me, it was weighted towards 350s, Cai. And I think the full year will be weighted more towards 350s.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Good. And then a last one, so if we back out Beech, you did a 1.8% margin in the first quarter at Cessna and I think your guide is 2.5% to 3% excluding Beech, and seasonally things get better. You are talking about pricing improving. Is that a realistic number? Does that have upside or is there something else happening in terms of the funding of R&D that would make that the real number and not really a bit conservative, which is the way it looks?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it's a realistic number, Cai. As always we have said we will have a little bit better incremental volume as we go through the year not dramatically but I think we will also with the TENs coming in, we have a mix that\u2019s more oriented towards a combinations of TENs and Sovereigns which is good mix for the business.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Right, but I guess my point is, if volume is going up and you have a 25% plus incremental margin, and mix is going your way, one would think you would get a little bit more than what is it, 70 to 130 bps off the first quarter given the seasonality you've got.", "Scott Donnelly", "Again as we look at this right now Cai, we don\u2019t see significant increases in terms of quarter-over-quarter. It will be up slightly but not dramatically.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple of questions to follow-up on the Cessna line of questioning. Scott, can you give us some sort of feel for how demand is for the Latitude? I know it was received well but is there any maybe color you can put around that or numbers or something?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well we haven't been giving order books specifically by model. We have a number of orders already in the book for Latitude for sure. But I think as we have talked about it before at this stage of the game we really need to have aircraft that are flying and fully outfitted and able to do demos and things of that nature, and really start to build out that order book into 2015. We have the initial aircraft that\u2019s up and flying. We have a couple of more that are in process including one of the aircraft which will be fully outfitted with the real interior design and that will be the aircraft which will be going to shows and starting to perform customer demos and I think we won't see a lot of order activity until that aircraft is out there because at this stage of the cycle I think before somebody lays a deposit on a $16 million, $17 million [ph] airplane. They want to see the real airplane, and sit in the airplane and take a flight in the airplane. So we understand that and we have the first couple of aircraft, obviously we\u2019re more dedicated to flight test programs. We\u2019re in the process of building out the first one that will be a customer demo aircraft. ", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then maybe shifting gears a little bit. How is it, is there an early read yet on how the move into flight simulation has gone with the integrated product, last time I was up in Rhode Island we were talking about how Textron wants to offer an integrated package to the customers with flight simulation. And how is that going?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would say right now we\u2019re very happy with how it's going. Our order rate on the simulator side of the business is doing very well. There is a ton of opportunities out there in both the commercial air transport market as well as a number of different business jets and helicopter programs. We already have our first development underway to support our own products that being the Bell-525 simulator. So the team down in Florida is already started to work with the Bell team in the design and development of the 525 sim and so I would say, obviously we\u2019re only a few months into this thing but I feel very good about where we\u2019re. The thing is performing as we expected and the order rate seem to be pretty good.", "Ron Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great and then maybe one last one, back to defense. My favorite product, the Scorpion. Last time we spoke you had mentioned that maybe by the end-of-the-year a customer would emerge. How do you feel about that still and how is that program going.", "Scott Donnelly", "So the program is going extremely well. The aircraft is flying terrifically. It's already over last week exceeded it's flight envelope, so we have seen speeds in excess of what we\u2019re advertising and still had more throttle push for the thing. So the aircraft is flying very, very well. The guys are super happy with it and it's where we expected it to be. We have a lot of marketing, sales activity underway right now. We have conversations going on with a number of different customers. We have had customers that have actually come into Wichita to see the aircraft, so I feel pretty good about where we\u2019re. But there is a big ways to go to get from that to where somebody signs the dotted line and actually places an order for the aircraft. So by the end of this year I still think that\u2019s a possibility. We\u2019re working hard to try to make that happen but I would say there is still a lot of work to make it happen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Two questions. First question is in regards to Cessna after market, I realize that's something that you report in more detail annually than quarterly, but how is it tracking as we finish the first quarter and enter the second quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "It continues to track positively. I say it's probably up mid-single digit kind of numbers.", "Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Nothing out of the ordinary there?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, you know for that business Justin, if it just kind of continues to march along at that rate that\u2019s very healthy. I mean it's really driven by aircraft utilization and people coming in for service activity and what not. So that\u2019s one where you kind of expect to see nice steady growth, that\u2019s what we have been seeing and expect to continue see on the Cessna side and frankly we expect and just kind of factor that in as well in terms of Hawker and King Air size of business.", "Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "And my second question is just a little bit more general. You've been in your role now for around four years and you're really taking a big step forward and consolidating the private aviation market with this Beechcraft acquisition. What is the company going to look like in three years from now and what would make you disappointed three years from now if something doesn't transpire as you expect it to?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think Justin, if you look at what\u2019s really going to drive the business over the next few years particularly within the aerospace aviation side of this, be that the aviation segment or Bell, is -- I mean obviously you\u2019re doing something like the Beech acquisition is a big deal but I think over the next few years what\u2019s really going to drive our success in large part has to do with driving these new product program. So we have the Latitude hitting in \u201915, we got lot of other activity at Cessna, we will talk about it in the future in terms of new products and when you look over it at Bell you got the 525, the 505. I mean these are big programs that I think are resulting in products that are going to drive a lot of demand and share for our businesses in the market. So those investments we\u2019re making which are pretty significant right now. You know really are the things that are going to drive our performance improvements over the next few years. ", "Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "And it's interesting to hear you talk about new product. With respect to Beechcraft, I mean clearly that is an investment that is as large as many of the combined new product investments you are making. What would be the upside scenario in Beechcraft and is it as likely now as it was when you announced the deal?", "Scott Donnelly", "We certainly feel just as good about it as when we announced it. The market, we think is still performing well for the King Air product line. It's a great product; it's always been very well received. Customers like it and it's a workhorse in that industry. Obviously it's going to require sustained levels of new product investment and R&D and upgrades and just like the jet business does, so there are things that are announced out there that will be upgrades to that product line as it moves forward but I think what we thought we were acquiring in terms of that product is exactly what we got. There have been no surprises whatsoever. I think the brand is still in very good shape, it's a strong brand in the marketplace, good demand for the product and it's a great product. It's exactly what we expected.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Yes, just a follow-up Frank, to the question earlier. So in the fourth quarter you had $0.20 of operating benefit and $0.35 of restructuring for $0.15 dilution and now we got $0.08, so if you just -- what's changed in that?", "Frank Connor", "The restructuring number is smaller than the cost that we had thought at the time that we did it. So I think if that\u2019s the big delta George is the restructuring charges has come down a bit.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And the operating number is about the same because it closed the same time you thought it would close?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, I mean the operating number -- those were annualized numbers versus partial year numbers and so that has an impact. As we indicated at the time we were going to have purchase price gross margin impact. We have refined that number, that's now expected to be about $65 million for the year and so I think it's largely a function of the partial year versus the animalization and then the -- a little bit of a change on that restructuring number.", " ", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "And then just a follow-up Scott for you on the margin. Is your comment that the margin won't go up a lot necessarily in subsequent quarters because the first quarter was somewhat high because of the high level of Sovereign deliveries which won't repeat?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think the margin rates will be incrementally better George, because we will have obviously the Sovereign, although Sovereign is probably a little stronger in the first quarter than the balance of the year because of the roll over for Q4 but then we also have the TENs based on now getting the certification done. So the volumes will be up slightly through the balance of the year and I think the margin mix will be favorable. So we will see some incrementally better margins.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "I was trying to follow-up to Cai's point arguing that I agree with his comment that incrementally you would think the margins; your guidance for the year would be low. So I was just trying to argue that maybe the first quarter was a little bit higher because of the Sovereigns, otherwise I still think -- I agree the margin is probably -- your guidance is probably low for the year.", "Scott Donnelly", "There is no question, we had a lot Sovereigns in the quarter, we probably won't have quite that number of Sovereigns on a go forward basis. We will have the TEN, so I think we\u2019re just having a friendly debate about how much better should they be.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay.", "Doug Wilburne", "All right George, thanks a lot. And ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call. Thank you for joining us and we will see you next quarter.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). That does conclude your conference for today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later on we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to your host Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Rosanne and good morning everyone. Before we begin I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $670 million from last year\u2019s second quarter. The Beechcraft acquisition, completed at the end of the first quarter contributed $425 million to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $0.51 per share compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2013.", "Last year\u2019s second quarter EPS was reduced by $0.07 per share and severance cost recorded at Cessna, while this year's results reflected a full quarter\u2019s impact of the Beechcraft acquisition. The Beechcraft impact included an $0.08 EPS reduction from fair value step up adjustments of acquired inventories sold during the quarter and $0.05 in restructuring charges, which were recorded on a separate line for acquisition and restructuring cost.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $271 million compared to a $362 million use of cash in last year\u2019s second quarter. Pension contributions during the second quarter were $27 million. And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks Doug and good morning everybody. Revenues were up 23.5%, reflecting solid organic growth and contributions from acquisitions. At Bell we delivered 10 V-22s and 8 H-1s compared to 9 V-22s and 6 H-1s in last year's second quarter. On the commercial side, we delivered 46 aircraft up from 44 a year ago. On the development front during the quarter, we received certification for the wheeled landing gear version of the 429 model in Taiwan and Argentina following first quarter approvals in Canada and Brazil which expands the appeal of the platform to a broader customer base. We also delivered our first 412EPI model at the end of June to the New South Wales Police Department in Australia.", "Our 505 Jet Ranger X development program remains on track for first flight this year as total (inaudible) demonstrated maximum continuous power during the first engine test. We also continue to make good progress on the 525 Relentless as we completed the first all-composite main rotor blade, received our first GE engine and began gear box testing. Overall assembly of the first aircraft is also progressing and with the next month we will be ready to join the three main [capital] sections with initial flight targeted for late this year.", "On the military side, we signed the [another] contract for 24 additional H-1 aircraft worth about $450 million with expected deliveries beginning late next year. We also continue to make progress to our potential foreign military sales for the V-22; negotiations are ongoing for the six initial units for Israel and we're working with a number of foreign governments which should result in additional [FMS] orders.", "Moving next to Textron Systems, revenues were down as we expected but program performance and a favorable mix of contract revenues resulted in the segment margin of 12.1%. We continue to make progress on the Shadow TCDL upgrade development program successfully completing the final operational testing valuation during the quarter.", "We also saw continued performance stability in our Aerosonde fee-for-service platform and we recently received a new task order to continue operating under the Navy ISR program. During the quarter we also won a $190 million contract for approximately 360 sensor fuse weapons to be delivered to Korea beginning in the third quarter of next year.", "Most recently, we completed an acquisition for our new TRU Simulation Training business with the purchase of ProFlight an innovative provider of pilot training, specializing in Cessna CJ series and Cessna [Caravan plus] turboprops located in Carlsbad, California.", "This acquisition of FAA part one 42 approved training operation was an important next step as we build our business aviation pilot training capabilities. In addition we were just selected by Boeing to develop and supply the full flight simulator training suite for the new 737 MAX program. This is a significant strategic win for TRU as we expand the air transport portion of this business.", "Shifting to industrial, we saw a good growth across all our businesses reflecting our continued emphasis on innovation, new product introductions and bolt-on acquisitions. For example in May we announced the acquisition of TUG Technologies, a leading manufacturer of the ground support equipment in the aviation industry significantly augmenting our line of specialized vehicles.", "In addition to the obvious sourcing and manufacturing synergies with our existing E-Z-GO Cushman and Bad Boy operations we will be able to leverage sales of TUG products around the world based on our global distribution channels.", "Moving to Textron Aviation. In the quarter we delivered 36 business jets and 34 King Airs. In last year\u2019s second quarter we delivered 20 jets and Beechcraft delivered 24 King Airs. Trends of jet demand factor such as aircraft cycles, corporate profitability and availability of used aircraft all continue to move in the right direction. Despite the fact that we remain an in-spot market new products are supporting demand in this segment of the industry.", "On the new product front FAA certification of the Citation Ten+ was obtained late in the quarter which allowed us to deliver the first three units. We also completed the EASA certification of the new Caravan EX, the M2 and the Sovereign+ in the quarter.", "Our Latitude Program continues to progress towards an expected 2015 entry into service, we now have two Latitude aircraft in test flight reaching over 100 test flights and expect a third to be available for certification activities later this month.", "Moving to the defense side Textron Aviation. We had two new orders for our T6 military turboprop [tankers] during the quarter; one for the Mexican Air Force for 12 units and one from the U.S. Navy for 29 units which represent the last lot under the existing JPADS program.", "Overall the T6 and the weaponized AT6 are generating significant international interest and we are pursuing a number of promising opportunities.", "Our Scorpion program also continues to progress as it recently completed a 4,700 mile trip from Woodstock, Kansas to United Kingdom to participate in the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough air shows. Interesting, the Scorpion at both shows has been very encouraging and we are in discussions with a number of customers with potential initial orders. Scorpion is also scheduled to participate in a U.S. Government emergency preparedness exercise later this year sponsored by the Pentagon's Northern command, where we'll demonstrate its surveillance capabilities.", "To wrap up, we believe we had a very solid second quarter with strong revenue growth and improved overall margins and cash flow performance demonstrating that our strategy is investing in new products and distribution is paying off and we are seeing significant contributions for our M&A investments.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $304 million up $91 million from the second quarter of 2013 on a $670 million increase in revenues.", "Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $623 million from this period last year reflecting $425 million of acquired Beechcraft revenue and higher new jet volumes. The segment had a profit of $28 million compared to a loss of $50 million at the Cessna segment a year ago. This reflected a $28 million charge taking into segment last year for severance costs higher new jet volume and the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition including a $33 million acquisition inventory step up impact. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion down $100 million from the end of the first quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were up $94 million reflecting higher commercial and military aircraft deliveries as well as a $41 million revenue benefit related to settlement with the U.S. DoD related to the Systems Development and Demonstration phase of the company\u2019s former Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter Program, which was terminated in October of 2008. Segment profit increased $6 million from the second quarter of 2013 reflecting a $16 million profit impact from the ARH settlement.", "At Textron Systems revenues were down $140 million reflecting lower overall volumes. Segment profit was flat despite lower volumes reflecting favorable performance across all product lines and favorable mix of contract revenues during the quarter. Industrial revenues increased $93 million reflecting higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $15 million due to the higher volumes and improved performance.", "Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million primarily due to gains on finance receivable dispositions during the second quarter of 2013. Segment profit decreased $8 million primarily due to prior year impacts of loan loss reversals and gains associated with the finance receivable dispositions partially offset by lower administrative expenses.", "Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at $88 million, down $10 million from the end of the first quarter while 60 day delinquencies were $96 million, down 29 million in the quarter.", "Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $38 million, interest expenses $36 million up from $30 million a year ago, reflecting debt cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing partially offset by the requirement of our convertible debt in May of last year. We recorded $20 million of restructuring costs in the quarter on the acquisition and restructuring line and we still expect full year costs of about $45 million. Our tax rate was 31% and we're still estimating a full year tax rate of 31.5%.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So Rosanne, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Alright. Your first question comes from the line of John Godyn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. The Bell margins at least versus our estimate came in quite strong this quarter. The last that I remember, management had suggested that Bell margins might come in a bit next year. Is that still the right framework or are we seeing some -- any kind of core operating improvements that might actually improve the margin outlook as we look out?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well John, obviously we're not at a appoint where we're going to give any kind of explicit guidance on 2015 margins. Obviously there was some benefit in the quarter of settlement on ARH, it was about $16 million which we would not expect to recur. On the other hand, we are working our way through as you know some of the higher cost as a result of last year\u2019s issue. So I think the margin rate in the quarter is about where we would have expected it to be in terms of operational performance. We all know, we'll see lower volumes on V-22s and lower margin rates on V-22s will be going to 2015. So we still have some work ahead of us but we continue to put a lot of focus on cost control and tighten cost base to try to help us get there in 2015.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And as we think about the long-term outlook for biz jet, of course you have seen great contribution from some of the new product lines. When we think about some of the legacy product lines though, do we feel like we're seeing enough here that it's fair to say that these jet trends have sort of stabilized and on their way to a rebound as we look out longer term? If you could just kind of update us on your thought process there that would be helpful.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think John stable is probably the word we would use right now. I mean I think the market is okay for legacy products, we're doing alright. Obviously most of our growth this year which we forecasted and are realizing is a result of new products. So when you look at full year, Sovereign buses and M2s and now starting to get Citation TEN plus sales, most of what we're seeing -- all of what we're seeing frankly in terms of upside in the market and revenue versus what we saw last year is really driven by new product programs. Of course, we expect to have a contribution in 2015 as a result of the fact that we'll have latitude as well.", "So, the underlying market, stable is probably the right word and we certainly hope to see it recover as time goes on. As I said earlier, we're seeing fewer aircraft available for sale in the used market; all indicators are fairly positive, but it's been stubborn in terms of the rate of recovery. So, we're still largely banking on new products coming into the market to drive most of the growth.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "That's helpful. And then just last question on the outlook for capital returns. Operations have been quite good, it seems like biz jet is stable, integration on Beechcraft is going well. Of course you have some debt here to pay down over time but I'm just curious what management's thought process on capital returns to investors going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, I think on the capital returns, as I said, we took some debt on obviously associated with the Beech acquisition and that\u2019s kind of the top of our priority list in terms of getting that paid down to get back to where we think the balance sheet should be. We will continue to do stock buyback to avoid the dilution of our employee plans and as we\u2019ve said before we would, on a sort of as appropriate basis continue to do some stock buyback beyond that if it makes sense. So in addition to that of course we\u2019ve had a number of small acquisitions. And I will expect we will continue to see some number of small bolt-on deals. So it\u2019s not a lot of capital but I would say that\u2019s in total how we view our use of cash flow balance sheet.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Very helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Chris Sands - JPMorgan", "Hi good morning guys. It\u2019s actually Chris Sands on for Joe. Scott, wanted to ask you about the outlook for the 412. The first half run rate suggested that rate could be down quite a bit year-over-year which is in contrast to your expectation for growth overall in commercial. Could you just give us any insight into the demand trends there?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, Chris, we were certainly very light on 412s in the first quarter. The second quarter 412s were comparable versus 2013 and about where we expected them to be. So we still do have sort of a heavier back half in terms of 412 deliveries. And we don\u2019t usually go down to guide on unit-by-unit basis, but there\u2019ll be relatively comparative numbers versus 2013 is how I would think about the 412 deliveries.", "Chris Sands - JPMorgan", "For the overall year or just in the second half?", "Scott Donnelly", "For the overall year. I mean we are a little bit wider because of the first quarter was lighter, the second quarter was comparable. And I would expect as a result the backhalf will be a little heavier on 412s in last year, so the total year would be pretty similar.", "Chris Sands - JPMorgan", "Great. And then in Systems you\u2019ve commented on the strong program performance kind of across the portfolio, but can you quantify the overall level of [EACs] that added the margin in the quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well we'll give you the guidance, the total EAC number for the company so I wouldn't break it down into the division-by-division, but we did have EACs in the quarter and I think we've seen pretty strong performance our procession ammunitions business is doing a nice job on productivity, we're seeing it pretty much everywhere across the different businesses. The only thing that I think we would refer to is we did have very good mix i.e. in this quarter, we were very strong on our procession ammunition business which tend to be a positive mix for us.", "We didn't see a lot, we did get through the final test evaluation on TCDL but have not started shipping-in in those units yet. And obviously we're sort of in the transition on the vehicle side where we are very wide in the quarter, because we are transitioning from the old April ramps and we'll now start to ramp deliveries for the Canadian program. So those will all be a lot more third, fourth quarter loaded.", "Chris Sands - JPMorgan", "Right. And then overall your expectation for revenue and margin in the segments for the year hasn\u2019t changed?", "Scott Donnelly", "That's right, it has not, which means you're going to see more revenue and a lower margin rate as we go into the back half of the year.", "Chris Sands - JPMorgan", "Right. Alright, thanks guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila from Jefferies. Go ahead. Please state your last name.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Thanks Scott. It is Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Thank you for taking my question. I guess could you elaborate a little bit more in the conversion opportunities that you're seeing with hawker customers. Has the sales force approached their owners? Any quantitative commentary would be great in terms of I think offering [March after] trade-in option, is it the service offering, how are you lowering them in?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I would say it is kind of couple of step deal. So the first step is as we talk about building that relationship so certainly reaching out to the hawker customers on the service front, folks are already operating these aircraft. There has been a lot of work going on to just make sure we have spare parts flowing and getting that channel filled again and making sure that we are taking care of the customers that already own the aircraft. Clearly we have started discussions with a number of those customers around what they are going to do in the future and making sure that when they want to flip over to new aircraft or upgrade it\u2019s going to be under our line.", "So we have frankly a dedicated group of people that are working that pretty hard and interacting with those customers, keep in mind it\u2019s only been a few months that we have been doing this. And so anyone that\u2019s going to entertain a new aircraft or upgrading an aircraft there is usually a process that takes a little while.", "So I don\u2019t think I would say at this point here is x examples of hawker customers that have decided to move their next aircraft into the Citation jet but we fully expect that will happen overtime. So but again the job one and the first thing we put a lot of emphasis on is making sure that the level of service and support is back to where they expect it. And I think we are making some progress there.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Okay. And then in terms of Cessna pricing of course or Textron Aviation pricing in Q2 could you comment on that? Did you sustain the momentum in Q1? And then also for overall Textron Aviation EBIT, how should we think about cost for the remainder of the year and how that progresses?", "Scott Donnelly", "", "So I think on the pricing front things have been pretty stable probably up just a little bit on most of the models in terms of our cost position I mean the run rate I think we are about where we need to be and we have the teams work pretty aggressively even before the integration period making sure we are ready to take the appropriate cost actions and for the most part those have been taken and we are I think more or less where we need to be at this stage of the game in terms of our cost run rate.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Got it, thanks a lot.", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the mix effect I guess within Textron Aviation. You talked about the mix effect in Systems as we look at the second half. On the Q1 call you talked about Tens and Sovereigns coming in should push up the Cessna mix on margins as we go through the year. Do you still expect improvements in the second half versus Q2 or you think Q2 was a pretty representative quarter in terms of mix in Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think Q2 is pretty representative. I mean for sure Julian if you compare it on a year over year basis, we do have more sales obviously of the Ten+, the Sovereign+ in the mix. So, I think we're -- should be fairly stable in terms of the mix of the relative sizes of aircraft through the balance of the year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And then on R&D, I think that was down about $14 million year-on-year in Q1 for Textron overall. Is that a similar progression in Q2?", "Scott Donnelly", "That's a good question Julian I have not gone through the number, it was reported\u2026", "Frank Connor", "I don't think that (inaudible) the case because we're consolidating Beech now and that would be added in so it becomes a\u2026.", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s just a timing issue. Yes.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Got it. And then just on now I guess your sort of first half clean margin is sort of 11%, 11.5% if you strip out the ARH\u2019s gain that's implying as for the fully you have a decent margins step up in the back half sequentially even things like V-22 deliveries are flat. Is that just kind of timing on cost savings about coming through in the back half or is it sort of the mix from\u2026.", "Scott Donnelly", "There is a bit of cost and there is a bit of positive mix in terms of the mix of commercial helicopters as well. So, now we would expect to see more 412 activity in the second half of the year.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Mr. Sprague, do you have your mute button on?", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Thank you, good morning everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi Jeff. How are you?", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Hey, just a couple clean up items if I could. First, just on Bell, has kind of the capitalized costs that are in inventory from the labor disruptions and everything kind of worked their way through, is there any residual impact to that left in the back half?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, there is Jeff. I think we've expected throughout the full year to see about a 100 basis points drag as a result of that working its way through. So that will be the same in the second half to the first half.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Okay. So there is no kind of tail off even from a run rate basis?", "Scott Donnelly", "Really starts with the tail as we go into the beginning of 2015.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And then I was wondering just on turning the Beech inventory and getting kind of the PPA step-up behind us, where are we at on that perhaps Frank and how do we think about that in the back half for the year?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. So, we've gotten through 45 roughly of the 65 that we have talked about. So there is about 20 to go and that will obviously hit the back half, add that product and so, it's probably a little bit heavier in the third quarter than the fourth quarter but it depends on delivery.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "And then also just wasn't clear on Beech. Are you implying that kind of Beech net of the step-up and restructuring and everything is kind of OP breakeven or can you give us a little color on just kind of the underlying OP performance at Beech?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it's hard for us, Jeff because we\u2019ve consolidated all these things together. So you're really, we're not tracking given all the SG&A, all the engineering, manufacturing; everything is sort of put together. So we can still get some visibility on the revenue front, the operations are totally integrated. So we really don't have the ability to sort of tease out the differences between those. I guess the only guidance I can give you is gross margin on products is pretty equivalent. So I don\u2019t think -- you can\u2019t forget the accounting of the step up that the margin rates of the various product lines and their contribution are pretty comparable.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Right. And I guess finally just directionally on Bell R&D, is that still have an upper or does that have an upward bias here with 505 and 525 also as you are looking at maybe kind of the overall Bell top-line coming down, obviously with V-22 next year, are you able to kind of compensate the R&D investment?", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Well there is some pressure on that Jeff and like 505 and 525 which will both go in the flight test programs late in the year or so, obviously through 2015 there will be a very active program and flight test for both of those and of course we have the V-280 program which is also ramping up. So there is certainly pressure in terms of R&D, new product programs associated with Bell given that level of activity.", "Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research", "Okay, great. Thank you guys, appreciate it.", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Alright. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jon Raviv - Citi", "Hi, good morning. It\u2019s actually Jon Raviv on for Jason. I had a question about your M&A activity recently specially with the simulation business. I was just wondering if you could talk about what the growth rate out gives you that business and how large you think it can get at this point? I know you talked about some numbers before but if you could update us there that would be helpful.", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Jon, I don\u2019t know we give any specific numbers in the growth rate. I mean I think obviously the reason that we went into the space was because we think at a macro level it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s going to be growing probably at least mid to high single-digits. There are different segments of the market obviously. Our intent is to participate on the air transport side as a simulator provider. And I think you have seen that we\u2019ve had sales that business has largely been in sort of the Boeing and Airbus commercial transport market. This win with Boeing to be the provider for 737 MAX is obviously very big deal for us. And so obviously as the 73 MAX comes into production and they start shipping those around the world, we think we'll get some significant growth associated with that program.", "On the training side, it's obviously oriented towards our platforms i.e. by Cessnas and Citations, King Airs and Bell. So, we would expect that business to grow as we introduce new products and start to do more and more training with our new customers that come on line for those platforms.", "So, I don't think we're going to give a specific number. I mean it's certainly reasonable to expect that it should be in the high single-digit kind of growth based on what's going on in the marketplace. And clearly we would like to think that we can gain some share and that would help us always that to be a double digit kind of growth business for us.", "Jon Raviv - Citi", "Great, thanks. And I was wondering if you could update us on the cadence of business jet deliveries. It seems like things are going to be a bit smoother. I was just wondering what your strategy has been in making that happen versus especially how it's been the past couple of years?", "Scott Donnelly", "We would love for it to be level loaded. Anytime you\u2019re running a manufacturing operation and having a more consistent level load and that's how we like to manufacture and so having a working capital tie out. So revenue was great and this year has certainly been much better than last year and that was there. And part of that is the market and gain a lot of it is driven by the fact that these are new products and so the demand has been steadier for those in the marketplace. We\u2019re not competing with our used aircraft so things tend not to get all the way and trying to do deals at the end of the quarter. So, I think the order flow while it\u2019s not as strong as we\u2019d like to see it ultimately. The order flow has been certainly a lot more level loaded through each quarter in the year.", "Jon Raviv - Citi", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Yes. Thanks a lot and good quarter. Can you give us a split on the backlog between Beech and Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I don\u2019t think we are going to break that out Cai. Obviously you\u2019ve got Cessna, you\u2019ve got Beechcraft, King Airs, you\u2019ve got the military business, it\u2019s all going to be in that one backlog number.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Okay. And then the margin given the size of the inventory step up look considerably better than I would have guessed for the level of volume you achieved, is that kind of -- is that sustainable or is there anything abnormal where there the used aircraft was a plus looked pretty good for the level of volume you achieved?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think we\u2019re pretty happy with it Cai. I think that the restructuring activity associated with the synergies and combining the two businesses is on track with where we expect it to be and frankly we\u2019re also seeing some good productivity as we\u2019re bringing the teams together. So it\u2019s not just the synergies the reductions of headcounts, but I think the operational efficiencies throughout the factories were also good in the quarter and that contributed to help give us a pretty strong margin rate.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Where are you in terms of your expectation of synergies for the year, are they bigger, the same?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think the synergies are pretty well on track and again I think to the extent there is upside Cai, it\u2019s the fact that we're just seeing better productivity and operation on top of the synergies.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Got it. And maybe Frank you could give us an update on pension? With the expectation of a transition next year to new mortality tables, discount rate is down. Can you provide any color in terms of what we should expect from pension next year?", "Frank Connor", "Cai we're still looking at it and we won't have those numbers until we kind of formulate them at the end of the year and move into next year. We have had pretty significant change in our workforce that we're running through as well and certainly interest rates where they are would put some pressure on things and the mortality rate, will put some pressure on things. So I don't expect it to be a headwind it's just a question of kind of what type of tailwind might it be and it's probably going to be lower than what we might have thought it\u2019s what we said here the year ago, but we're still working through those and can't give you explosive guidance on that until we actually run the numbers and get the guidance.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Terrific. The last one TCDL are we likely to have any shipments there in the third quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai I hope so the biggest milestone that we needed to achieve is getting through the final operational test evaluation and we did that. In the quarter, there are still a few things just in terms of final configurations and working through to do the official [submittle] of the ECP into the customer and so those conversations are -- and that review process is ongoing. So I would certainly hope that we will see some initial sales in the third quarter and then the balance of our plan in the fourth quarter, but I would say worse case even if it's delayed somewhat I would still feel pretty confident that we'll get what we expect for the total year in the back half of the year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "", "Good morning, good numbers.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks George.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "I want to try Cai\u2019s question a little differently. Could you just sit there and provide of the $100 million decline in backlog how much of it roughly might have been due for Cessna and how much to Beech without breaking out the military part of Beech that\u2019s applied to each?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, George I obviously don\u2019t -- I do not even know the answer to it because I haven\u2019t, we haven\u2019t been splitting the number up that way, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to provide that in terms of guidance or status because it will just be the segment backlog number as we would normally report. And I don\u2019t think there is anything that I even know to say that there have been a material difference between how much of the backlog burn off came out of the Citation jet business versus the King Air business.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then one other on Beech. In the first quarter you\u2019ve said dilution for the year would be about $0.08 a share. Is that number still the same or are you just not going to even provide it given that you\u2019ve combined everything?", "Frank Connor", "I mean, at this point, it\u2019s a combined operation. We have reiterated our guidance that we gave the last time around. So, we\u2019re really not tracking that separately now. It\u2019s a combined business and we\u2019re moving forward on that basis.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. I mean George, we honestly don\u2019t look at it that way, the engineering teams, the manufacturing teams, the sales, marketing all these teams are now fully integrated. So for us to even try to do that would be sort of arbitrary allocations of those functions to a product lines to try to come up with such a number. So, again it\u2019s not how we operate the business and as a result we really can\u2019t report it that way.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then just one in general Scott, I mean we\u2019ve obviously seen business jet cycles improve and as you mentioned everything is going in the right direction. Can you just kind of size up the lower end of the market versus kind of the middle end of the market as you see it today?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, I think the lower end of the market has been sort of stable. We\u2019ve seen good demand and deliveries on our M2 which is a new product. I think things have been pretty steady for things like our CJ3s and XLSs. We\u2019re seeing a little more strength at the higher end of the market with the Sovereign pluses and the Tens but again I think that\u2019s more driven by the fact that these are new products are getting out in the market as opposed to necessarily any real difference in generically speaking market demand between say light versus a mid or super mid size aircraft.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then just one quick one for Frank. What was the growth in the aftermarket business at Aviation?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, well and again it\u2019s tough to look at the comparabilities because of we now have the Beech in the mix but we continue to believe and it\u2019s trending at a mid kind of single digit higher single-digit type growth rate on aftermarket. So, business continues to perform well there.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Good morning guys, nice quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank you.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Hey just on the strong Aviation margin this quarter the underlying rate of like 5.2%, I mean, will you guys attempt to kind of raise margin guidance for the full year from that 2.5% to 3.5% or do you have any performance concerns in the back half of the year just strictly the spot market nature of the business right now?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s very much the latter Pete. I think that we\u2019re pleased with how the integration has gone, the synergies are coming along as we expected, we feel good about plant performance, the operational side of things. And while we like that it\u2019s been a more stable market and we\u2019re balanced, there is still a lot of work to do in terms of sales activity in the second half of the year result.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Okay, got it. And then just a couple of quick\u2026", "Doug Wilburne", "For Iraq, I just have to say I think that's our first temptation question in my experience doing IR.", "Thanks for that.", "", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Not a problem. I wanted to ask something -- a couple of program questions. It looked like you guys were negotiating with Iraq on a sale of AT6s, it looked like it could be a nice deal for you. Is that -- what do you think about the timing on that given what's going on over there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it's a very good question. So there has been discussions of an [AT 6T] over the Iraq. Frankly there are several things across our various businesses that have been in discussion with Iraq. And of course we sold things in Iraq before. So, I\u2019d say, it's very hard to predict where those programs are going right now. There is clearly a desire for the products, the Iraqis continue to express desire to acquire them, but government is awfully busy with a lot of other things right now. So it's -- the level of instability, makes any transaction difficult.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Understood, understood, okay. And last one on Scorpion. It wasn\u2019t very long ago, the Scorpion seemed like it was going to be very kind of far out. But it seems like a lot of momentum is building and I'm just wondering what your view is. I mean should we start thinking about factoring in some Scorpion revenue at this point for 2015, are we that far along at this point?", "Scott Donnelly", "I wouldn't get too far ahead of yourself just yet. So what we are encouraged, there has been an awful lot of customer interest having the aircraft to kind of make its debut publicly over here and to be seen by an awful lot of foreign militaries which is sort of our principal customer target at this stage of the game, has been encouraging. But as you know when a military looks at acquiring an aircraft, there are budgetary cycles, there is a lot of work to do to translate something where somebody says, hey that\u2019s very interesting, that would fit well and taking it from that discussion to an order and then a ramp up of production is going to take some time.", "So I feel pretty good about where we are. I think the product is performing flawlessly. I mean the guys have done just a super job. It\u2019s flying very well, everybody is thrilled with it, customers are very impressed with it but it\u2019s going to take time. We really just started to market the product. So it\u2019s going to take a budgetary cycle or two to take interest and to turn it to doors.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Thanks guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Miles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks, good morning and good quarter. I think in response to question on a trajectory of Bell R&D, you talked about some of the upward pressures from the new programs and the dollar; I am curious can you do the same kind of commentary around Cessna, and particularly with the latitude probably winding down a bit on spend and a lot of it is just to do spend in particular how that cadence should look?", "Scott Donnelly", "", "So as we went into this year, we expected R&D to be down slightly at Cessna in terms of the jet business, I mean just comparing the old Cessna to the sort of piece within the current business. Just because we had so much (inaudible) activity last year that really drove certification activities that drove quite a bit of the R&D cost. At this stage of the game, our principal aircraft that really is in the certification is latitude. So you have one instead of three and that does save us somewhat on the certification cost. So, I think that's the expectation I would have this year and I expect that to be the same next year. I think it will probably hold reasonably flat on a consolidated basis. Right? So, if I look at what's going on, on the jet business, there was money obviously being spent at Beechcraft associated with upgrades and keeping the King Air line and T6 and AT6 lines active and I think we'll see that. So, I guess my view going from \u201814 to \u201815 would be that it's probably neutral in terms of R&D as a percent of sales if you will.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "", "And is your view on the longitude and expansionary nature of Cessna jet portfolio is still the same in terms of timing for that kind of entry into service and expansion of the offering?", "", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we're always looking at the line but I think that the trend towards investing in some of the larger aircraft will absolutely continue. So our guys continue to work in the longitude program. There's number of things we're doing. I think you'll see we continue to be committed to growing the sort of a larger end of our fleet of jets.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, got it. Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning, Rob.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "On the first question, I was wondering if you could comment on used aircraft activity in Textron Aviation and what sort of trend you saw there in the second quarter.", "", "Scott Donnelly", "Used activity continues to be good. We moved a number of aircraft in the quarter. I'd say the used market in general has been pretty solid. In terms of valuations, I wouldn't say we\u2019ve seen a significant pick up although we\u2019ve seen some of the reports, have seen a little bit of strengthening in some of the pricing, some of the lighter end. And I think in general that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. So it's stable and most importantly the market is active, our aircraft do turnover, which is good.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Okay. Second aviation question, this might be tough. But you mentioned stability a couple of times in the business jet market and like. But is it reasonable to start expecting some stability in the backlog as well?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean obviously the two are going to be correlated rather, they're still selling that goes on in the quarter for the quarter and so you can see increased levels like we've seen in this quarter of selling that doesn't have a positive impact to the backlog. But that's the result of still having a bit of spot market. There is still more selling than we\u2019d like to see obviously for a quarter in a quarter, we have some models out that's we've said before and pushed out where availability is out there the next quarter but there are still aircraft that are available for sale in the third quarter. So I think as long as we have an environment that we'll kind of make it hard to see a lot of growth in backlog and we've been fighting our way through that now for five years.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "And just a final one, industrial margin was a very solid in the quarter. How do you expect this to trend for the rest of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "The second quarter is always our strongest just because of the cyclical nature of the different businesses and how they contribute. But I think what we\u2019ve seen in the recent past and we expect to continue to see is that if you look on a year-over-year basis, we're going to continue to see some expansion in those margins and part of that's driven by volume, part of that's driven by new products and some better pricing. So I think across the board, we feel pretty good about where those businesses are. So second quarter is usually a peak margin rate for the year, but I certainly expect on a year-over-year basis we\u2019ll continue to see margin expansion each quarter.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Sure.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Rice from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey Scott just one quick follow up on sales activity in the second half. So I think on the Sovereigns in particular I think you said that the 1Q the Sovereigns has booked about one quarter out. Is that still the case there and how confident are you filling any empty slots for that particular aircraft (inaudible) particularly you got close to the Latitude launch date?", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Well we still see there are still some slots on Sovereign pluses that are available in the year. We have got I would say a pretty robust set of customer leads and through this year we have been in that mode and those deals have been closing. So the Sovereigns plus has been performing really well, it has had great receptivity from customers and I would say again it\u2019s in this market environment which has been sort of stable the demand for the Sovereign plus has been pretty good.", "So lots of customer interest, lots of demo flights and lots of deals that have been closing. So I think we feel pretty good about it. The Sovereign plus versus Latitude, I mean certainly the Latitude has a larger cross section to the cabin, but it is a 6 seat aircraft as opposed to the Sovereigns which is the double club and the Sovereigns also gives you that coast to coast range. So we still have customers that need that range capability and need that pay load capability and so I think the Sovereign plus remains a very strong platform even with Latitude into the market place.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then just to confirm one thing I think I heard APG you were talking about some data point suggesting that the used market pricing had taken another turn down but it sounds like from your comments today that the actual pricing in the used market is relatively stable, is that right?", "Scott Donnelly", "", "Yes it really does won around by model. So I think the last set of books for the first time people are talking about some positive price on some of the CJ3s for instance and things like that. But you are always -- we still continue to see some price degradations on some of the aircraft and quick part of that is just, the aircraft get old right. So you are always going to see a certain amount of price decline. But I would say net of overall what we're seeing in terms of our transactions and sort of a book reflected in the industry is that it's been pretty stable and are in good progress.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "And you have follow up questions from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Yes, just one question. I mean it looks like in the quarter you kind of beat expectations from a profit line in all of your businesses. It sounds like tone of business is pretty good and you didn't raise your guidance. Is that just being conservative or is there something we should be more worried about in the second half?", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, I think that we are feeling good about our operations and how things are going. As I said earlier I think when I look at the Aviation business as well as Bell on the commercial side, there is still a lot of sales activity to go in both of those businesses, that's kind of where we've been for some time with Cessna and I think with King Airs and we feeling good about the prospects and the customer activity and order closure rates and things like that. But there is still a lot of work to be done.", "Similarly on the Bell side, I think operating performance, actions the team has been taking have been good, but even at Bell on the order side, we still have aircraft to sell. And well that market has been pretty strong, we are seeing a little bit slower closure activity, there is a lot of bid activity, but there is not -- just from where we would like to be right now on the year the number of deals that have closed to ensure those third and fourth quarter sales has been slower coming than we would have expected. So the year is always a bit back ended, great loaded and it\u2019s going to be the same this year. But I think operationally we feel very good about where things are. I would be a little conservative on upside just given the nature of how much selling activity still has to happen in the Aviation and Bell segments to close up the year where we\u2019d like to be.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jon Raviv - Citi", "Hi guys, it\u2019s Jon Raviv again. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Scott, just on that point in terms of Bell closing activity being a bit slower than expected, just wondering if you guys at all have any color to that why you think that might be the case?", "Scott Donnelly", "We don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s kind of a sense that we\u2019re getting across the whole industry. If you look at the reported numbers or what not, there is again still a fair bit of activity. I think part of it is some uncertainties and in some parts of the world. I guess we have some opportunities pending in places like Russia where there has been a lot of change in their economic outlook over the last six months. And I think some of those kind of orders are kind of pending until people understand where that\u2019s going. There is still a fair bit of uncertainty in Latin America, there is, it\u2019s just -- I think there is clearly demand out there but I think a lot of people are going through their processes and getting the bid packages, they see their needs, but they\u2019re a little slow pulling the trigger right now.", "Jon Raviv - Citi", "Are you seeing any impact in terms of closure activity due to heightened competition with there being more players in particular segments in [aftermarket]?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think this is an industry wide, I mean everything that we\u2019re kind of hearing is there is nothing unique going on at Bell, I think it\u2019s just the industry as we serve and just kind of what\u2019s going on in those sectors. But again deals are -- these are all competitive deals, and so the guys are putting up bid packages. It\u2019d be a different story if we were losing deals. It's -- I don't see any trend or significant difference in terms of a share issue there, competitive deals and bids are submitted and people are sort of just delaying making the awards.", "Jon Raviv - Citi", "Great, thanks so much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "And your next question is a follow-up from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Yes, Scott. I was wondering if you might comment on what percentage of deliveries at Cessna you still need to sell for the second half of the year and how that compares to where you were at this point last year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sorry George, I don't know. I mean obviously we don't publish that number. I don't think there is a huge dynamic. I mean as I said, the back end of this year compared to the back end of last year has a lot more new product in it, particularly the third quarter. So we're -- I went back to the numbers I would say we're probably in somewhat better position just because we have a lot more new product here in the third quarter. And as you\u2019ll recall, we didn't have Sovereigns and the M2s until the fourth quarter last year. So at least for the third quarter we're certainly in a better position than we were a year ago.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Could you comment on how many TEN deliveries you might expect or the ballpark for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "No we wouldn't, we did three -- so I mean in the second quarter as we just finished the certification but we've kind of talked in general terms in the past George I think the TEN is probably sort of 6 to 10 aircraft a year kind of market the way we see it.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. Thanks again.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Doug Wilburne", "Alright. I believe that completes calls in queue. So thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining us. Have a good day.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Brad and good morning everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.4 billion, up $526 million from last year\u2019s third quarter. The Beechcraft acquisition, completed at the end of the first quarter, contributed $398 million to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $0.57 per share compared to $0.35 in the third quarter of 2013.", "Textron aviation operating results included a $10 million reduction to segment profit from fair value step-up adjustments to acquired Beechcraft inventories sold during the quarter, plus there was an additional $3 million charge related to Beechcraft restructuring costs, which were recorded on a separate line for acquisition and restructuring costs.", "Together these items reduced EPS by $0.03 per share. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $144 million compared to $269 million in last year\u2019s third quarter, bringing year-to-date cash inflow to $304 million, compared to a use of cash of 580 million at this point last year. Third quarter pension contributions were $17 million. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks Doug and good morning everybody. Revenues were up 18% in the quarter, reflecting success of new product investments and our acquisition strategies. For example, at Industrial, we saw growth across all our businesses, reflecting the impact of new production introductions and recent acquisitions in the segment such as TUG Technologies, Dixie Chopper and HD Electric.", "On the new product front, Textron\u2019s specialized vehicle, we introduced the new Recoil iS Crew, an electric Bad Boy Buggies vehicle with the cargo bed and two forward-facing bench seats. At Jacobsen, we rolled out a completely refreshed TurfCat front rotary mower featuring all-hydraulic; traction drives with the lowest cost of ownership in this class.", "In Textron Tools & Test in August, we made a small technology acquisition that resulted in the launch of a new product The DataScout 10G which further adds to our currently family of Ethernet/Transport network analyzers. At Caltex, revenue growth reflected ordinary strength in the North American market, which did overcome some softness in Europe.", "Moving to Systems, revenues were down in part due to delay in TAPV vehicle program for which we had expected to begin delivers in the quarter. During the reliability testing in August, we identified the need for a number of durability improvements in the vehicle steering system and in cooperation with the customer, we decided the best approach to suspend the testing to support an optimal redesign and retest process.", "Our initial analysis indicates that we\u2019ll be able to meet the vehicle durability requirements with relatively minor modification [to us] during system. We expect to redesign validation retest process, we\u2019ll do initial deliveries by about one year.", "Elsewhere in systems, we\u2019re making progress on a number of fronts. Our TCDL program, the customers agreed to begin accepting production units which commenced during the fourth quarter. Our Unmanned Systems business which recently awarded a contract to provide an Unmanned Naval Mine Detection System for use in conjunction with the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship. This will validates investments we\u2019ve been making to leverage our unmanned aircraft technologies in the marine-based applications.", "Our [SIMTRU], Simulation and Training business we now have plans to open an East Coast Citation training facility in Tampa, Florida, which will complement our West Coast facility in Carlsbad California providing more convenient access for our customers. And earlier this week we announced we\u2019ll be opening a training center in Valencia, Spain in 2016 with the Bell 429 full flight simulator as our initial offering.", "On the air transport side of TRU, we delivered a Boeing 737 NG simulator that we used at Boeing Training Center in Singapore. We also won a contract to provide China Express Airlines with the Bombardier CRJ 900 full flight simulator for pilot training and a contract to provide Airbus A320 full flight simulator at Ansett Aviation, one of the largest training operators in Southern Hemisphere.", "In our Bell segment, we delivered 12 V-22s and 4 H-1s compared to 10 V-22s and 7 H-1s in last year\u2019s third quarter. On the commercial side, we delivered 41 aircraft, down from 54 a year ago. We continue to see slow order flow across the commercial helicopter market compared to last year and at this point with only a quarter ago, we expect 2014 commercial deliveries will be down from last year\u2019s 213 units.", "Despite this environment, Bell\u2019s win rate remains favorable, especially with our model 429 where deliveries are up year-to-date over last year. In China, we received regulatory approval to conduct helicopter pilot and maintenance training for our growing business in the country.", "During the quarter, we were also named the number one product support organization by Aviation International News for the 9th consecutive year. We continue to make great progress on development of our 525 Relentless program. Our first two test vehicles are in final assembly and manufacturing process is going smoothly, thanks to large part use of new digital design and manufacturing process tools.", "We\u2019ve also begun safety flight testing for most of the major components of the systems. However, in order to accumulate the hours necessary to demonstrate safety margins on all components, we now anticipate first flight will occur during the first quarter of the year. Development of our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also proceeding well with first flight still expected by the end of this year. We also broke ground for our new 505 assembly facility in Lafayette, Louisiana. We continue to sign new customer purchase agreements reflecting solid demand for the aircraft in the marketplace.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter we delivered 33 jets and 30 King Air turboprops. In last year\u2019s third quarter we delivered 25 jets and Beechcraft delivered 26 King Air. We\u2019re seeing a number of encouraging trends with Textron Aviation. First, integration of Beechcraft is going extremely well, which is evident in our cost productivity with a significant sequential improvement in margins. Another example of integration benefit is the roll out of the new product support program for our King turboprop customers, based on Cessna\u2019s ProAdvantage life cycle service program.", "On the market front we continue to see the availability of used aircraft come down and our only used trading activity has improved. In the new aircraft market, we have seen a pickup in order activity since September. With improving market dynamics, we\u2019re encouraged as we prepare to exhibit our full line of products in next week\u2019s annual NBAA show including the debut of the first fully configured Citation Latitude.", "I was in [with talks] several weeks ago I have the opportunity to see the NBAA Latitude first hand. It\u2019s a great looking airplane and it makes an impressive statement about value, comfort, style and performance. In fact with over 600 cumulative flight hours and development program, we recently announced that the aircraft\u2019s range has been increased to 2,700 nautical miles.", "To wrap up, we believe we had a solid third quarter with overall revenue growth, improved manufacturing margins and solid cash flow performance. Furthermore, our strategy of investing in new products is paying off and we\u2019re seeing significant contributions from our M&A investments.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott. Good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $293 million up $85 million from the third quarter of 2013 on a $526 million increase in revenues. Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation.", "At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $487 million from this period last year, reflecting $398 million of acquired Beechcraft revenue and higher new jet volumes. The segment had a profit of $62 million compared to a loss of $23 million at the Cessna segment a year ago. This reflected the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition, higher new jet volume and favorable pricing and inflation. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, approximately flat with the end of second quarter.", "Moving to\u00a0Bell, revenues were up $20 million, reflecting higher V-22 program volume partially offset by lower H-1 and commercial deliveries. Segment profit increased $15 million from the third quarter in 2013, primarily reflecting favorable performance.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were down $47 million, reflecting lower Marine and Land Systems volume partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit was down $8 million, reflecting the lower volumes.", "Industrial revenues increased $74 million due to the impact of acquisitions and higher overall volumes. Segment profit increased $1 million, reflecting the impact of higher volumes offset by an unfavorable mix of revenues in the quarter.", "Finance segment revenues decreased $8 million, primarily due to gains on finance receivable dispositions during the third quarter of 2013. Segment profit decreased $8 million primarily due to prior year impacts of loan loss reversals and gains associated with the dispositions, partially offset by lower administrative expenses. Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at 101 million, up 13 million from the end of the second quarter while 60 day delinquencies were 70 million, down 26 million in the quarter.", "Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $22 million and our tax rate was 30.7%. Interest expense was $37 million, up from $29 million a year ago, reflecting debt cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing. We recorded $3 million of restructuring cost in the quarter on the acquisition and restructuring line and we still expect full year cost of about $45 million. During the quarter, we repurchased about 4.1 million shares at an overall cost of about a $152 million.", "We also repaid $200 million of our $500 million five year bank loan from the Beechcraft acquisition. Finally, we are increasing our full year earnings per share from continuing operations guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 a share and increasing our estimated manufacturing cash flow from continuing operations before pension contributions to $700 million to $800 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So Brad, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question will come from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Scott, just first of all on the Systems side of things, given that there is some large lumpy programs here, if you could just maybe give us an update on what you expect revenue to be for the year relative to your earlier expectations. And then I know you\u2019re not going to give 2015 guidance yet, but as we think about the year delay on the vehicle program, what\u2019s the profile sort of the quarterly run rate we should be thinking about until you start those deliveries?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, first of all Joe, the revenue at the Systems is probably going to be down about 300 from what we were originally forecasting and that\u2019s principally driven by vehicle programs.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then, into next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "We are probably not going to go into 2015 guidance yet Joe. We have a lot of work to do here at the balance of the year and make sure that we know where we are on the TAPV program in particular, we\u2019re well into the analysis phase; we feel pretty good about where it is. We\u2019re just based on that starting to lay out what that recovery plan looks like. So, I think we probably would prefer to wait and give you the guidance on that when we get into the January call for 2015.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. Over Aviation, good margin there, but when we think about the Beech cost saves that you laid out at the time of the acquisition, is there a way of thinking about how much of that is now embedded in on a run rate basis in the Q3 number?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, Joe absolutely, I mean clearly what\u2019s happening here is that the number that we guided you guys, we\u2019re getting there quicker is basically what\u2019s happening. So I think the speed of the integration of the cost takeout, the integration of the organizations and whatnot has happened quicker than we laid out. So, I think we still feel pretty good about the absolute numbers that we gave you but we\u2019re going to get there sooner.", "So, obviously that\u2019s going to drive some margin expansion in the year that\u2019s part of what -- the largest part frankly what\u2019s driving our increase to our guidance. We had said originally that to help you guys think about \u201815 to think about a couple of hundred basis points improvement over where we would be this year, obviously that\u2019s not going to be as bigger number, because we\u2019re going to achieve more of that this year.", "So, when you think about going forward, it\u2019s not going to be a 200 basis points, because we\u2019re sort of raising the bar this year only because we\u2019re getting there quicker.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just finally sticking with Aviation here, you mentioned, I think you mentioned that orders have ticked up since September, I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019re talking about the certain models or maybe if you could just give some context there and talk about the market environment and demand environment for Cessna jets in particular?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. I think we have seen an overall better demand environment, I mean July and August are always tough, people are out on holiday. But there is no doubt that as we got in the sort of the September and the beginning of October timeframe, we\u2019ve seen a pretty significant uptick in terms of the demand a lot of activity up here and it\u2019s pretty much across the Board. We\u2019re still doing very well. And M2 this year it\u2019s a new product and across the CJ line we\u2019re a little bit wide on CJ3 this quarter, but that\u2019s driven by the fact that was really the transition for the old CJ3 to the CJ3+, which is now certified.", "So we feel good about demand for that, all the way up. Sovereigns is still doing very well XLs are doing well. So I think we feel probably have seen one of the strongest September, October levels of activity that we\u2019ve seen in quite some time.", "Joe Nadol - JPMorgan", "Okay. I\u2019ll turn it over to someone else. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wondered if you guys will expand a little bit on the mix impact that you called out in industrial as unfavorable. And then perhaps just tell us there was anything in the Bell margin that was one-time in nature perhaps related to the getting to the end of the V-22 multiyear contract ahead of the transition to the next one? Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Carter. So on the Bell front first of all; there was nothing unusual in there. I think if you look at the total company in terms of cumulative catch adjustments it was only $10 million across all of Textron. There certainly was some positive contribution there in Bell, but nothing that\u2019s unusual for us in a typical quarter. So it was really driven by strong performance in the business.", "As you know, we\u2019re still playing our way through a little bit of trapped inventory costs from last year\u2019s issues and efficiencies around some of the labor activities. So we still face a bit of that headwind, but I think the guys did a nice job of performing and delivering a pretty good margin rate in spite of that. So no, there is nothing unusual in there. It\u2019s just -- continue to try to drive the cost base down in the business.", "With respect to the Industrial segment, the margin, this is the first time in a while we\u2019ve not had a margin expansion on a quarter-by-quarter basis in that business. It\u2019s a little disappointing, but I think we\u2019ll call that back here as we did into the fourth quarter and still turn a year that has margin improvement in the business.", "In terms of the mix, largely driven within our automotive business, we\u2019re seeing some significant growth in our SCR business. And as we talked before, the SCRs do come with a lower return on sales because there is a large component of cost that\u2019s largely a pass through on that. And so that does provide some dilution in terms of our overall ROS number. And so that was probably the biggest moving part in there.", "It\u2019s been a tough year frankly in the golf and in the turf business. We are I think you probably heard of that from everybody in the turf side, so Jake is having a little tougher year than usual. But the CapEx piece and the mix around SCR versus our blow molding tank side is the primary driver.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", " ", "Okay, great. And just perhaps one or two for Frank, just clarification; on the Beech inventory step up impact, I think you said last quarter you\u2019ve been through 45 or 65 you called out, you said another 10 this quarter. So are we still expecting a kind of 10 million in the fourth quarter? And then with respect to the corporate expense, it looks like given the pattern of the first three quarters it might be under running that full year expectations slightly. Is that the case and did that contributed all to the increase in the guidance as well? Thanks.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. On the step-up, yes, we\u2019re at 55 now as you point out and we expect about 10 for the fourth quarter and then we\u2019ll carry over probably about 15 into next year as well in terms of additional step-up. So there is no change there. On corporate expense, no, you know that we always have quarterly volatility; it revolves around kind of share price activity and just levels of spent. So we\u2019re still looking at about a 150 million for the year.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays", "Okay, great. Thanks gentlemen.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Frank Connor", "Good morning, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Scott, I wanted to ask about Bell commercial and I guess what I\u2019m wondering is, you had this big step-up the past two years in a pretty strong market to this kind of 180 to 215 aircraft call it per year. Each of the next two years as you see it now, does this business stay up in that kind of annual delivery range or was there so much demand from a particular end market or a particular product cycle recently that this business needs to revert back to the 150 to 170 kind of range that it had in a lot of good years, but not quite as good as 2013 we\u2019re in the past?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think we\u2019ll stay in the range that you talked about at the beginning here. I mean predicting the end market obviously is a bit of a wild card and we are seeing some slowness right now. But I think what\u2019s important is that our share has increased over the last couple of years as a result of a lot of what we\u2019ve done on the product side. So even in a market that would be like the market had been back when we were in those call 115 days to 150 days, I think our share has improved and would keep us in that kind of 180 plus range; last year, it was 213; I do think will be down somewhat from that as we look at the balance of this year just because of what\u2019s happening here, softens. But I don\u2019t see us going back to the old days, primarily because our share is in a much better position. And clearly as we get into 2016 and beyond as you add in the 505 and 525, I think that really gives us that next step-up in terms of where we\u2019ll be from a total number of deliveries of helicopters.", "So, again try nicely, it\u2019s a little bit from the market, because I can\u2019t really predict that but I certainly have seen as we\u2019ve talked about before, our share increase and I think the products investments are certainly paying off and 505, 525 will only help that going forward.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "On the market, can you elaborate on where you\u2019ve seen some incremental softness; is that in oil and gas, because of oil prices or elsewhere, any color you can give us there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think some of the oil and gas has been softer, we\u2019re seeing some of the slowdowns in EMS certainly things around tourism. It\u2019s really kind of across the board. And I think it\u2019s just a lot of people concerned about what\u2019s going on around the world economically.", "So, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen; it\u2019s probably too soon yet to see what the reaction of the oil and gas market is to the drops in the price of oil. But that\u2019s a variable; I think it still needs to play out. I think most of what we\u2019ve seen this year versus where we expected was around things like EMS and certainly some oil and gas has been a little softer even before we\u2019ve seen these changes in oil price.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And you called out favorable pricing in Aviation. Any additional detail you can provide there on where and to what degree you saw that?", "Scott Donnelly", "In terms of the Aviation business?", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Yes.", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s more or less firmed up across the Board on our products, I think part of that again is driven by new products having the M2 out there; having the Sovereign out there; the CJ3+ upgrade I think certainly helps us. And importantly, on the used side, we\u2019ve seen prices are not going up but they\u2019re firming and not continuing to drop in that residual, in fact certainly has a knock on effect into new aircraft pricing as well.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "And the inflation comment that\u2019s separate from pricing, can you just explain what that is and why it\u2019s different? You called out pricing and inflation separately in the press release I think.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. We\u2019ve seen some deflation in Aviation just kind of due in part to outdoor scale and kind of purchasing activity and things. So we\u2019ve kind of benefited from some good cross productivity on the supply side in Aviation as well.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. I think that\u2019s just, Noah, general category of productivity, right? I mean we\u2019re seeing some good productivity in terms of labor and the plants; we\u2019re seeing good productivity in terms of supplier purchasing; it\u2019s really across the board.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Thanks a lot. Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hey Bob. ", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Scott, I thought I should start on the Industrial division and whether you\u2019ve seen any signs of weakening in some of these European markets over the last quarter and what your expectations might be for the final quarter here including foreign exchange?", "Scott Donnelly", "So foreign exchange hasn\u2019t been a big issue for us, it\u2019s kind of immaterial number for the company and even for -- within the automotive business. But I would say Robert that there is no doubt that we have seen weakness in the European auto market. And so our European sales have been down, that\u2019s largely been offset by the fact that North American market continues to be up and the Asian market has been up slightly. So the combination of those other markets, and again a lot of expansion in new products particularly driven by SCR is offsetting just volume demand of the European models of cars.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "And then maybe switching over to Bell, you\u2019ve talked in the past about some of the prospects for V-22 export. I was wondering if anything has progressed over the last quarter whether we summed up some of these prospects.", "Scott Donnelly", "I would say no.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada ", "", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hey I mean it\u2019s just -- look Robert I mean there is a great deal of frustration on our part. The deal with Israel which has been talked about a lot is still moving forward, but it\u2019s moving forward at a slow pace. There has been progress. I mean the F&F cases are working our way to the process. So I think Japan has been talked about a lot. It continues to progress, it just progresses very slowly. I wish I could tell you that in one quarter\u2019s time I see a lot happened, but it takes time.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "And then maybe just a final one for Frank. Any comment on pension and what the changes in discount rate could mean for next year?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. I mean obviously there is tremendous volatility in rates and returns and everything else right now. I\u2019d say kind of overall; we don\u2019t believe it will be a headwind. We thought it would be a tailwind. It will depend a lot obviously on what happens between now and year-end, but kind of as we look at the sensitivity around it right now we think that kind of it will be no worse than flattish type area.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "And does the MAP-21 legislation have any change on your contribution?", "Scott Donnelly", "It pushes out some \u201816, \u201817 required contributions. It doesn\u2019t have any impact on \u201815.", "Robert Stallard - Royal Bank of Canada", "Thank you very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And our next call, question will come from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Scott, I was just hoping you go back to your comments on biz jet demand. I think on the last call, the view was legacy product continues on exciting and new product is sort of driving all the motor activity. Now you broadened up that commentary which sounds exciting, I mean it sounds like legacy product is doing better. I\u2019m just curious sort of taking a step back; we\u2019ve seen a lot of [head bakes] in biz jet uptick. And you guys have done a good job kind of moderating expectations, but it can\u2019t help, but interpret your commentaries very positive. What\u2019s different this time? Is this not just seasonality? Why is this -- why are these data points that you\u2019re seeing now maybe stronger and maybe have more signal value than what we\u2019ve seen in the past?", "Scott Donnelly", "We probably feel better about where we are right now again partly due to new product. So we got the M2 which has been very well received, we got the Sovereigns doing well, the TEN is doing fine, I mean it\u2019s just not large volume product. Now with the CJ3+ in there that gives us one more product offering in sort of the middle of the product range. But as we\u2019ve said earlier, I think the demand has been -- we expect it to be fairly constant. And in the total marketplace most demand creation will be associated with new products.", "And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been seeing happen through the year. And the good news with that obviously as we\u2019ve had a full year or some of those new products like the M2s and Sovereigns and TEN; is we\u2019ve been a bit more level [loaded]. So we don\u2019t have this huge fourth quarter run-off to get to where we were targeting in terms of the total year. And the demand is there and so we feel pretty good about our ability as we look out over the quarter or so to feel good about what the demand looks like and what our production rate looks like and what our available for sale looks like.", "So, the total market has certainly improved. The better linearity of being able to run the business for more linear function is helping and it\u2019s helping to drive some of our cost and performance. And so I think that\u2019s why we feel pretty good about where we are. Obviously as we look into 2015 on the basic theory that the new products are what helps drive your growth with the Latitude performing, as well as it\u2019s performing the way the aircraft looks, the way it flies, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the demand for that aircraft. We have the first one out there now, it\u2019s already doing a bunch of demo flights, it\u2019s going to be out there at NBAA and I think it\u2019s a beautiful aircraft and it will help us in the 2015 if that thing comes in the revenue generation.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "That\u2019s helpful. And when we think about aviation margins, you had some commentary about synergies and pricing. But if I just sort of put it altogether, I mean as a simple point, can we use this quarter\u2019s margin as a base for forecasting going forward? It\u2019s very strong; there are things in the number that you would highlight as sort of being irregular for whatever reason for the purposes of forecasting going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I don\u2019t think there is anything irregular in there. It\u2019s just straight performance. And so that kind of margin rate with that kind of volume is certainly expected.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And then just last one on capital allocation. About a year ago when the Beech situation I think was a bit harder, we were talking about buybacks, but obviously the Beech deal I think took that off the table for a bit, you\u2019ve been very successful and in fact accelerating some of the synergies on Beech. At what point and is it time now to have the conversation about buybacks again? Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "We\u2019ve -- our position especially on buybacks as you know has been that we\u2019ll do enough to offset dilution of employee programs and that we look at sort of additional buybacks on an opportunistic basis. And so we did do in the quarter about $4 million of -- I am sorry 4 million shares of buyback in Q3.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "I guess I mean more of a larger scale buyback with cash flow.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think at this point, we\u2019re also still doing things like paying down our bank lines associated with the acquisition of Beechcraft. So, we have to sort of have a balance here in terms of what we\u2019re allocating in the paying down the debt associated with Beech as well as trying to continue our buybacks. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect us to come out and announce some committed number. I think we\u2019ll stay on the commitment of avoiding dilution and opportunistically executing buyback programs as we see fit. And the good news is our cash flow generation and strength of balance sheet I think allows us to be able to do both those things as we\u2019ve been doing.", "John Godyn - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from [Johnny Wright] with Nomura.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys. Just couple of questions from me, firstly, probably for Frank, backing into your revised cash flow guidance, I think you\u2019re looking for something like $650 million in operating cash flow in 4Q on net income of around $200 million. So you\u2019ve got say $100 million in depreciation but there still out $350 million gap. Can you just maybe talk through that is it a big working capital swing or is there anything else unusual in that 4Q cash flow?", "Frank Connor", "No, there is nothing unusual. And if you look at kind of our seasonality and quarterly progression, Q4 is always a very strong quarter, both from a profitability standpoint but also from a working capital performance just given the seasonality of the business. So, there is nothing unusual in there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So for the full year, you expect to have a positive working capital movement, something like $100 million to $200 million, is that fair?", "Scott Donnelly", " ", "I haven\u2019t worked through what that means in terms of the overall working capital but if you look at the fourth quarter this year, I mean this year\u2019s fourth quarter progression is based on that guidance, is actually down significantly from last year. So again, there is nothing unusual on the working capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then you talked about China and helicopter market in your prepared remarks, those had a big order this quarters in China, obviously a lot of potential there. Is there anything changing in that market? Do you see any prospects for actually some demand from China coming through?", "Scott Donnelly", "We\u2019ve had good demand from China over the last couple of years. I think part of that is just the economy is generally doing well. There has been a lot of liberalization of aerospace in the lower altitude which is where helicopters fly and so everything from corporate EMS to public inspection, utility, infrastructure, surveillance things like that which drives a lot of helicopter markets around the world. We\u2019re just seeing continuously that market grow in China and we\u2019ve been doing very well over there. Actually we\u2019re pretty pleased with our position in China and being able to -- it\u2019s getting a big enough market and a big enough demand which is what\u2019s driving us to start to do more training as well as airport training over there to help support the deployment of aircraft.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And just one final on Latitude, you talked about increasing the range of that aircraft. Is there any potential to get the existing Latitude amount to the 3,000 nautical mile range or would that need a bigger redesign or a new aircraft?", "Scott Donnelly", "That would be a bigger aircraft for sure.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And I guess it\u2019s pretty too early to talk about it but any plans to compete in that sort of coast to coast market with a flat body jet?", "Scott Donnelly", "Probably not going to make any new product announcements\u2026", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "I\u2019d say if we did want to sign you up would that be a commitment of any kind?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hey Pete.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "I might have missed that, are you still expecting 4.8 billion at aviation this year including 1.5 at Beech?", "Frank Connor", "It\u2019s a course there, Pete, it might be just a little bit lower not on jet deliveries, but a little bit less on used and couple of fewer [caravans], but in that range.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Got it, okay. Okay. And then I guess Scott, I just -- obviously just trying to figure out the cycle here on biz jet to some degree. How do you think about Beech being -- revenue being down sequentially? And then I thought Sovereign pluses you made some positive comments, but I think that used always Sovereigns were down sequentially also. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that and maybe you can give us also kind of what book-to-bill was in the quarter for Citations?", "Scott Donnelly", "Let\u2019s see Pete. Actually we don\u2019t really keep very close track at year-over-year comps on the revenue number with Beech\u2019s because Beech wasn\u2019t part of us and we\u2019re certainly reluctant to try to look too much at the financials. But sequentially -- sequential, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re down, but it\u2019s only a couple of aircraft. And so I think we\u2019re pretty linear about the King Air product line and I think we continue to feel good about where we are and the demands about what we expected, so plus or minus a couple of aircrafts. It\u2019s about what we expected and for the linear from quarter-to-quarter, which is good.", "On the Sovereign+ side, an aircraft or two, demand is still very good. I think we\u2019re going to be where we expect it to be on the total year. So the book-to-bill in these areas is pretty close to 1 to 1. We\u2019re not really seeing a whole lot of change from what we expected. So again on a sequential basis, we might be plus or minus a couple of aircraft, but it\u2019s about where we would have expected it to be.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Okay. So kind of still sort of a flattish market, but you just intuitively feel little bit better than you did the last quarter, is that a fair statement?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes we do, Pete. I mean look the Q3 is usually pretty soft, I mean if you look at the amount of order activity in terms of what flows in July and August is generally pretty light. And as you know Q4 usually tends to be a little stronger. People are back from holiday, they are looking at stuff and of course as always, hopes that they don\u2019t capital at the end of the year and from a tax standpoint we\u2019d just take delivery a Q4. So, I think part of this -- again there are smaller numbers sequentially from Q2 to Q3, but I think usually within the normal cycle of how we see that market working.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Okay. And then just last question on Latitude, can you remind us what quarter next year you\u2019re expecting the first Latitude delivery and do you built any backlog yet? And how should we think about the slope of the production ramp on that program?", "Scott Donnelly", "So we have built some backlog, we\u2019re still expecting to have certification in Q2. We\u2019re as you know we don\u2019t fully control that process, so if it\u2019s early in Q2 we\u2019ll get some sales in Q2. But certainly the vast majority of the Latitude sales I would expect to see in Q3 and Q4.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "And is that going to be a fast ramp or\u2026?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. It\u2019s already being ramped. Look the beautiful thing about this aircraft is a lot of the aircraft in terms of wings and all the cockpit systems are common to what we just did on the Sovereign+. So obviously it\u2019s a very new -- large, a much larger cross-section cabin. But and also lot of the key components and technology we developed as part of the Sovereign+ program.", "So we actually run these things as sort of a mixed model line if you will. If you go into the factory, we can run things down the line and whether it\u2019s a Latitude or Sovereign, it flows together quite nicely. So from a production ramp perspective, it\u2019s one that drops into our line very nicely.", "Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Yes. Thanks so much. So, your guidance for the year as I recall you were at 2 billion on System, so if you\u2019re down 300, it\u2019s a 1.7 billion and so you\u2019re basically saying volume will double in the fourth quarter from the third, how common? That seems like a huge jump.", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay. It\u2019s driven by the TCDL program. So as you know we\u2019ve been working on this program for what seems like a very long time going through all development work. As I said in the prepared remarks, we now have received approval from the customer to accept the units in the fourth quarter. Now those units have to go through their final acceptance test, there is quite test involved with the air vehicles and such. So that will happen here over the course of the fourth quarter, but we do now have their approval to go ahead and commence the production shipments. And so that\u2019s why the fourth quarter will be disproportionately higher in revenue than what we\u2019ve seen, because we\u2019ve built these units, Cai. They\u2019re manufactured and they\u2019re ready to go, now that we have approval we can go ahead and go through the formalities of the final production test, life test and acceptance. And we expect obviously that product to be happen here in the fourth quarter.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Is there sort of a disproportionate delivery in the fourth quarter because if we annualize that rate you just get a humongous number next year respecting even you don\u2019t have any vehicles in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Right, correct. I mean we\u2019ve had no sales associated with that program in any of the preceding quarters. So it\u2019s going to be a big spike in deliveries here in Q4. And again, the only reason that\u2019s possible is these things have been built. We\u2019ve been building them for the better part of the last year or so. And it\u2019s just a matter now of having to go through the production test and acceptance as opposed to normal production flow. So without a doubt, Q4 is much heavier. And as you go through 2015, you\u2019ll see a normal flow of deliveries of those units, not all of the contract units all in one quarter.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Got it. And so if we go to Bell, you did 12 V-22s. As I recall, you\u2019re looking for 36 for the year. So it looks like you go down to 6 in the fourth quarter. So, the mix which looks very favorable in the third would look pretty lean in the fourth; is that correct or has the full year number changed?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I mean the full year number hasn\u2019t really changed, Cai. I think all you\u2019re seeing is that of course the fourth quarter is the beginning of the next contract year and so we\u2019re now stepping down from the multi-year deliveries to the next multi-year. So, the run rate of V-22s is now going to step down and stay down at that level as we go through the next few years.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Well given that you\u2019re getting the step off and you have such a great mix in the third quarter, do you still feel comfortable as you look at next year that you\u2019re going to hold Bell\u2019s margins above 10%?", "Scott Donnelly", "Absolutely. Look Cai, we\u2019re still targeting the 12% number. I think the reason you\u2019re seeing the kind of margin numbers you\u2019re seeing and certainly our expectations for margins for fourth quarter is because we\u2019ve been taking a lot of cost actions to prepare the business for that lower run rate of V-22s. And I feel pretty good about where we are on that; the team has done a nice job of getting us where we need to be. Obviously we\u2019re not going to talk about a guide to 2015 yet at this point. The number we haven\u2019t determined is what our expectation should be on the commercial side of the market. We certainly know where we are in the military side of the market; we know what we\u2019ve done in terms of cost. So, we\u2019re still targeting the 12 and where we end up will have largely to do with what\u2019s our perspective on volume in the commercial market in 2015.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "", "Got it. And so if we go over to Cessna, so you\u2019ve seen a pickup in demand in September and October; normally, you kind of set your production targets in the fourth quarter for next year. What\u2019s your strategy going to be in kind of establishing the production targets for Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, they\u2019ve largely been set, because the lead time, the cycle time I should say on manufacturing in the jet world is depending on the model and I mean obviously we have some degrees of flexibility from model-to-model, but you\u2019re anywhere from 6, 9, 12 months. So, we\u2019re already running the production lines with the volumes that we would expect to see in 2015 including new things like the Latitude. Now we can make and always have the ability to make adjustments to that and as we go quarter-to-quarter, we do that. But it\u2019s for the next few couple of quarters, it\u2019s pretty well set.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Well, if it is pretty well set, what kind of flexibility do you have to take it up and to what extent are you more inclined to leave it set and just basically get stronger pricing?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think at this point we are -- our strategy is what we see in the marketplace, what we still believe is going to have in the marketplace is relative stability in terms of overall market demand and most growth or upside driven by new products. So as we think about our production rates for next year, as we\u2019ve been thinking about our production rates next year that\u2019s kind of what we forecasted this year and what we\u2019re thinking about for next year. So we\u2019ll keep most of the volumes of products about where they have been. And we would expect to see some upside from growth driven by the introduction of Latitude.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "And then in terms of the cash deployment, I mean with this huge step up and deliveries on TCDL, your cash flow is going to be very strong in the fourth quarter kind of as you have indicated. How come you don\u2019t buy more stock, what\u2019s the cash being saved for?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure Cai. As you know and as Frank said, we\u2019re a bit seasonal in terms of cash. And so we do generate a lot of cash typically in the fourth quarter that is mostly coming out of working capital in terms of usually inventories principally around the aviation and helicopter business. We\u2019ll continue to deploy cash as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. And that is largely around to pay down on debt, I mean we did take on a fair a bit of debt associated with the Beechcraft deal, we\u2019ve already paid down a couple of $100 million of that, we\u2019ll continue to pay that down and we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic about stock buybacks. So as I said, we took out 4 million shares here in Q3 and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to buyback additional as we think it make sense.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company", "Thanks a lot and good job.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Miles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Miles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning. First I want a clarification on the margins guidance for Cessna, I imagine if that\u2019s where most of the guidance uptick is coming from, you must be looking somewhere in the mid force of a little bit later on sales to Pete\u2019s previous question, is that right?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think we\u2019re -- we really don\u2019t want to get into guiding on each individual segment, but you\u2019re certainly correct. I mean the upside of what\u2019s driving the raise is certainly better margins in the aviation segment largely offsetting lowering up in the Systems business as a result of some of the vehicle delays. And again, we factor in some softness on the Bell commercial side which we\u2019ve already factored into our numbers. So it is driven by the aviation, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to revise any kind of guidance on a segment-by-segment.", "Miles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "All right, that\u2019s right. And then aftermarket commentary within Cessna and Bell if you can comment on the trends you\u2019re seeing there I guess Doug alluded to maybe that was maybe a little bit on the top-line pressure for the full year, but just the overall trend in the quarter that you saw in the [C7s] would be great?", "Scott Donnelly", "We\u2019re still seeing mid single-digit growth in our service franchises in both the Aviation and the Bell helicopter markets and that\u2019s there is a little volatility from quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s been pretty steady and about where we would expect kind of top-line mid single-digit sort of numbers. We probably see it from a record basis, a lot higher than that because of the Beech integration for this year, but in terms of actual growth it\u2019s probably mid single-digit.", "Miles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "And then one last one maybe for you Scott is, as you roll out the new products, obviously there is an international buzz, an initial pent-up demand and then often times there is a bit of honeymoon where it states, so on the CJ4 you see another programs. How do you think about the kind of the timing of launching, obviously M2 has got a great reception and there has been the Sovereign likewise, is there one year kind of phenomenon than you kind of normalize to where the true demand is or how do you think about that?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think in this market it\u2019s really -- certainly our expectations would be the deliveries on things like M2s and Sovereign will more or less stabilize where they are. I don\u2019t think that there is certainly back in earlier phases just like where we had a huge uptick and then kind of went back to a normalized level. We\u2019re not expecting big changes going forward as we look at things like in M2 or Sovereign. So that\u2019s why I say, I think our expectation is for those things which (inaudible) and transitioned into being a legacy product if you will is that they\u2019ll just follow general market demand.", "Miles Walton - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey hi. This is Charlie for Julian. I know that you guys said you wouldn\u2019t comment on the kind of segment margins, but just was curious if you could maybe just comment on systems just given the big kind of swing in revenue guidance for the year? Is that positive for the margins or negative or negligible?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t think we want to get into segment margin guidance. Sorry.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Hey, good morning. I was wondering, I know you touched on this briefly before, but maybe just a little bit more color if you don\u2019t mind on your activity that you\u2019ve seen in September and October to the extent that that results in deliveries in the fourth quarter and whether we\u2019re now beginning to take orders for further out and now actually starting to (inaudible) where we can build some backlog?", "Scott Donnelly", "Absolutely Jason, I think that\u2019s where we are. This is probably the part of the positive feeling that we have right now is that we clearly see a fourth quarter where the amount of aircraft we have left to sell is not as many as that we probably could sell. There is a market demand and so that would lead us to start moving deliveries into the first quarter of next year, which I think is a very healthy thing for the business. Getting out or having sort of a negative or one-to-one book-to-bill, I don\u2019t think, and we talked earlier, I think that the days of two years, I mean crazy numbers of backlog are not technical, but we\u2019d sure be able to run a much more efficient operation and have a much healthier industry, if we had six months to nine months of visibility, so that we\u2019re not having to sort of do forecasting around our production lines and customizations and things like that.", "So there is no question, that if we can get to a point here where we\u2019re at least three to six months out that\u2019s a much healthier business. And I think we\u2019re looking at the fourth quarter as the first time we\u2019ve seen in a while where we clearly see more demand out there in the market than what we think we have aircraft available to sell in the fourth quarter. And that will necessarily for some things in the fourth quarter which is -- into the first quarter, I\u2019m sorry, which is good.", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Right. Okay, that\u2019s great. And then as you look at the two businesses together, Beech and Cessna; and then the acquisitions which you brought in here of late, can you just help us and explain to us how you\u2019re thinking about seasonality in that, in the aviation business going forward? Historically we\u2019ve obviously seen some; is that becoming more muted, is it the way altogether or are we going to still continue to see seasonality into the second half of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think there is -- I believe there is always going to be a seasonality around the fourth quarter and that even by tax. So you have a lot of customers out there that given their brothers, they\u2019d rather take delivery of an asset or they can take a year depreciation in the current year rather than acquiring that aircraft in the first half of the following year. Is that a huge number? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge number, but I don\u2019t think that some seasonality around fourth quarter will ever go away in the industry because of that. The good news is again as we looked at both of our King Air business and the Citation jet business, it has been more level loaded of a lot of this year and that probably reflects some better demand coming back to the marketplace and obviously we prefer to see that.", "We would be much better running these operations on a more linear basis. We see more linear behavior towards the customers this year, but I still think you are always going to see some fourth quarter demand driven around tax.", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Okay. And then the last one from me is on the Industrial side. Are there any new products or programs that you\u2019ve been designed into and any of those businesses on the Industrial side that will lead to an acceleration of revenues over the next several quarters into 2015?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. Look, I think if you look at our Caltex on the automotive side of things, we\u2019ve had a lot of new vehicle, new platform wins in both the fuel tank side as well as a lot around our selective catalytic reduction business, there was demand for that vehicles; that family of vehicles grows in the marketplace that\u2019s going to drive nice revenue growth for our business. As I said earlier, the only challenge for us there is it does usually have a lower ROS, because part of the system is in acquired part which we pass-through at a lower ROS and would be typical of what we manufactured just because it\u2019s a high dollar source component. But clearly revenue growth and overall not growth will be driven by that business. And so it\u2019s a lot of new platforms which we won and new product around the SCR system. We still see nice growth both organically and through acquisitions in the vehicle business, as well as our tool and test business. So I think generally speaking the industrial segment I think will provide nice growth next year.", "Jason Gursky - Citi", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Good morning. Scott, given how strong you said September and October has been, is it fair to assume that the pricing might even be somewhat better in the September, October orders and what we saw in the strong margins in the current quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "George I wouldn\u2019t be too bullish on the pricing side. I think the good news is that it\u2019s firmed up. So -- and again this is the market dynamic, as we\u2019ve got more customers out there, it gives us the ability to hold the line on pricing. So I don\u2019t know that we see a step function by any means, here I don\u2019t want to mislead anybody, but it\u2019s not like the market is strong enough, the demand the kind of pricing that was in the last cycle, but certainly it has allowed us to firm up pricing and at least be stable maybe with some small gains because the market dynamics are stronger. So it\u2019s just supplying demand working a little more in our favor.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "And the strength you talked about was that similar international, domestic or weaker international given what we all read about?", "Scott Donnelly", "George our order intake in Q3 I think was still slightly biased to the Americas, but it\u2019s probably 60-40, some more an [eminent] balances around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But it\u2019s not way out of line.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And just some clarification, given the revenues you\u2019re suggesting for Cessna in the fourth quarter it looks like we\u2019ll probably get 70 plus deliveries in the fourth quarter?", "", "Scott Donnelly", "No, 70 would be -- I\u2019d love to have 70, but that\u2019s an awfully big number. I don\u2019t know if we want to get into exact units, George, but again I think we\u2019ve usually seen average aircraft revenues as I think kind of how we usually think about it being somewhere in the 8 to 9 range. So, 70 or something would be a pretty huge number.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay.", "Frank Connor", "The revenue number will be higher than that number we talked about.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. And then one last one if you split it all, give any color on whether the book-to-bill of one for aggregation was similar with both Beech and Cessna?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was pretty close, George, pretty close on both Beech Cessna military versus commercial. It\u2019s pretty close to one to one across every dimension that we would look at.", " ", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "And how about used plane sales in the quarter say versus last year\u2019s quarter, much different?", "Scott Donnelly", "I\u2019ll have to check the revenue number. I mean we usually have been looking at that one sequentially, George. So I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have that number on my tongue here. Certainly on a sequential basis it was\u2026 but we\u2019ll update you on...", "Frank Connor", "It was about flat from a revenue standpoint.", "Scott Donnelly", "On a year-to-year?", "Frank Connor", "On a year-to-year", "", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "And up a little bit sequentially you just said Scott?", "Scott Donnelly", "What he was saying I think average selling price was up a little bit sequentially.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. I can call you offline, Doug.", "Doug Wilburne", "Yes now we can try to -- we can get those for you George, we just don\u2019t have it.", "George Shapiro - Shapiro Research", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Good numbers.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess how do you think about the underlying profitability for the Beechcraft business as it stands today and where you see the run rate, do you think you need additional investments in the King Air portfolio and what about the service business? Is there additional capital required to increase the level of service there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sheila, we don\u2019t track report separately, the Beech number and part of that because we\u2019ve completely merged these entities. So I mean all the overhead pulls, all the engineering R&D what now results triggers one thing. So I wouldn\u2019t have the ability to breakout overall profitability of say historical Beech versus historical Cessna. But we\u2019re at a point where feel pretty good about the productivity that\u2019s been driven and that\u2019s benefitting obviously across all the product lines.", "In terms of R&D, we will now and we already are looking at the turboprop product line, the same way we look at the jet product line and laying out new product roadmap plans, upgrades, enhancements all the kind of things that people have expected us to do in the jet business. So absolutely there will be investment on the R&D side into the King Air and other historical Beech products as we go forward. And we think just as we do on the jet side that we\u2019ll have some good things coming out in the market as time goes on.", "In terms of capital, I don\u2019t see any big capital outlays. We\u2019ve got I think a very strong service network now around the world. And I think we\u2019re capitalizing on that in terms on taking some of the new service program offerings. We\u2019re trying to take most of our sites now and make it sort of capable of doing not just Beechcraft but also doing Citation jets or if there were Citation jets, now they can also do Beechcraft. There is some tooling involved in that, just to make sure that each of the sites have the capability to do both, but it\u2019s not a material number. Similarly on the overall aviation business side of things what CapEx is in there is really driven primarily by new product introductions. And so I don\u2019t see any appreciable sort of change if you will over what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years, because the flow of the new products will be pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you. And so just is there any way you could provide a range of where the -- whether it\u2019s King Air or the Cessna system portfolio; is that a mid single to double digit 10% margin business or is that at about a breakeven?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t think -- we\u2019re not going to into margin levels, yes by individual product lines.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "And then just last question in terms of Beechcraft synergies, you mentioned you are ahead; I\u2019m guessing 2014 has largely been focused on headcount. In terms of what\u2019s left for 2015, is it supply chain; is it additional footprint consolidation; how could we think about?", "Scott Donnelly", "Mostly what\u2019s out in the 2015 really is around some footprint consolidation, we have some warehousing and sites largely to do with our distribution of spare parts and services where we\u2019re going to consolidate some of that. And then there are some opportunities to do some consolidations in some of the back shops if you will.", "So, we don\u2019t envision any significant changes to final assembly operations. Those are running pretty well and are pretty focused around the different model types. But there is an awful lot of stuff that we today where we have two separate composite operations, we have two separate machining and metal bonding and a lot of fabrication sort of stuff. And we will continue as we go forward to see consolidation of those to again drive better cost efficiencies and better utilization of those facilities.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies", "Got it. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Doug Wilburne", "I think we\u2019ll take our last call now operator.", "Operator", "All right. And that will come from Ron Epstein with Merrill Lynch.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Hey, good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "So, just want to follow up on kind of one my favorite subjects with you guys is what\u2019s going on with the Scorpion? Are we any closer to customer or if you could just give us an update there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look Ron, I\u2019d say we\u2019re getting closer all the time. We have a bunch of customers frankly that we\u2019re talking to. There is a lot of activity in the market. There is a number of countries that are going to be putting out RFPs for how they think about replacing some of their aircraft. And part of that frankly is driven by the fact that there is something like that\u2019s out there now that they see as a viable affordable product to meet their mission. So we continue in pretty serious discussions on a number of fronts and feel pretty good about where we are. We did have the aircraft out at the Air Force Association meeting in Washington a few weeks back; we had a ton of customers coming through and looking at it; we continue to get very good feedback; we\u2019ve had a lot of customers that have come out to see the aircraft and go through pretty detail briefings in Wichita as well.", "So, I don\u2019t want to -- I don\u2019t have anything to announce to you, particularly today but I think we feel pretty good about where it\u2019s going on. And we\u2019re in pretty serious discussions with a number of folks.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And on that one, do you guys see it as a potential or maybe some modification to it as a potential bid for the upcoming China program?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, absolutely Ron. We\u2019ve been participating in the T-X program. There have been industry days; there is a lot of work going on in the Air Force right now as they kind of work their way through requirements definition. So, we are certainly inched in the program; we\u2019re following it quite closely as our number of other competitors. Look, I don\u2019t think the Air Force is interested in the big development program, so I think clearly one of the things they\u2019re going to have to do is look at what aircraft platforms are out there that are available that with some minor adaptations will fit what they need for TX. So we would love to participate in the program. We\u2019re working the program and how competitive we are or whether our aircraft is the right aircraft or not will depend on where the requirements document ends up. And that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll probably see till late this year or beginning the next year to know whether the Scorpion or a minor adaptation to the Scorpion is the right answer for them. We\u2019re certainly very interested and we\u2019re following it very closely.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then maybe just one last one. So you guys delivered 33 Cessna aircrafts in the quarter. The mix was clearly skewed more towards M2s; M2s clearly has been well received. But relative to historic levels, it\u2019s still pretty [anemic]. When we think about -- and again I know some sort of thinking about \u201815, \u201816 I mean is it okay to walk away from this call thinking we\u2019re in a market recovery or is it more walking away from this call that it\u2019s stabilized?", "Scott Donnelly", "You know Ron I still think that the way we think about it is that it has stabilized. And again upside to where we\u2019ve been is largely driven by new products. That\u2019s been true this year as we\u2019ve seen mostly growth driven by M2 and Sovereign. And I think that my plan right now would be that most of the growth next year would be driven by the Latitude introduction.", "So we feel good about where the market is, I mean it certainly appears to have stabilized. So as I said earlier, we like the level of demand that we\u2019re seeing. But I don\u2019t want to say that we think there is some significant inflection in the market just stability on current aircraft programs and new programs driving growth is still how we see it.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then maybe just one last one, that\u2019s not a fairy topic in mind with Medtronic. Have you picked up share you think by offering a training package with the Cessna product? Do you think you\u2019ve picked up share from likes of CAE in flight safety in that market?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think, Ron, it\u2019s still too early to say. I do think that -- and we\u2019ve had great feedback from a lot of our customers, particularly our CJ customers. As we acquire ProFlight, which gave us that CJ training capability on the West Coast. As I said, we\u2019ve now announced that probably by the second quarter we\u2019ll have that same training capability up and running in Tampa.", "So we do have a lot of our CJ customers that are giving us great feedback unlike the idea of being able to not only acquire the aircraft, but take care of all their sourcing aircraft and the personal training in the aircraft. So I do think it will help us. I don\u2019t know in that case not so much a share shift of the equipment side of the business, but some share shift in terms of the training side of the equation.", "Ron Epstein - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you so much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Doug Wilburne", "All right. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen this conference will be made available for replay after 10 O\u2019clock today and running through Tuesday January 27th at midnight. You can access the AT&T Executive Playback service at any time by dialing 1800-475-6701 and entering the access code 307263.

During today\u2019s call, all phone participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thank you, Gail. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $4.1 billion, up $591 million from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. The Beechcraft acquisition completed at the end of the first quarter contributed $556 million to the increase. Income from continuing operations was $0.76 per share compared to $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Textron Aviation operating results included an $8 million reduction to segment profit from fair value but the fair value step-up adjustments to acquire Beechcraft inventories sold during the quarter. Plus there was an additional $13 million charge in the quarter related to Beechcraft restructuring costs which were recorded on a separate line for acquisition and restructuring cost. Together these items reduced EPS by about $0.05 per share.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $449 million dollars compared to $774 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter bringing full-year cash inflow to $753 million compared to $256 million last year.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up 16.8% in the quarter reflecting the success of our strategy of investing in new products and complementary acquisitions.", "For example, at Industrial, we saw an 11.5% increase in revenues reflected across all of our business as well as the impact of the technologies, Dixie Chopper and HD Electric acquisitions.", "Most recently, in our specialized vehicles group, we purchased Douglas Equipment, a European-based aviation ground support business. Douglas Equipment are largely North American truck business with an international footprint, expands our truck portfolio to better serve the aviation ground support market.", "On the new product front, the Tools & Test, we introduced a number of new products during the quarter, including a new line of Mini fiberTOOLS for working on fiber optic communications facilities, and a new 6-ton Pistol Grip intelligent electric utility crimping tool.", "Contracts, we continue to win significant new automotive systems contracts around the world which we expect will support growth over the next several years.", "Operating performance was also a bright spot in this Industrial in the quarter, contributing to a full-year margin expansion of 40 basis points. We expect continued margin expansion in 2015.", "Moving to systems, revenues were up in the quarter as we began deliveries of the TCDL Shadow V2 systems. We also made good progress on our Canadian TAPV program having incorporated the necessary design changes and have started initial reliability testing of the vehicle. We believe we\u2019re on track to proceed full program testing in the second quarter with initial deliveries still planned for late this year.", "At TRU Simulation and Training, we signed a number of air transport simulator agreements in the quarter and announced plans for a new Cessna in Beechcraft aircraft maintenance training facility in Wichita.", "In our Bell segment, revenues were down as we delivered seven V-22s compared to 13 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, reflecting a start of lower deliveries called for in the multiyear program. We also delivered seven H1s, up one unit from last year\u2019s fourth quarter.", "On the commercial side, we delivered 57 aircrafts, down from 75 a year ago. Despite lower Bell volumes, fourth quarter margins were up 70 basis points from last year reflecting good cost performance.", "While we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in the commercial helicopter market, our commercial win rate continues to improve around the world. For example, we continued to expand our presence in China as evidenced by our success in the Zhuhai, China Airshow in November where we signed customer letters of intent for 61 new helicopters.", "We continue to make progress on development of our 525 Relentless program as we\u2019re well into our safety flight testing on the aircraft rudder system in [indiscernible]. Results of those tests have been encouraging and we expect the first flight later this spring.", "Development of our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also proceeding well as we conducted a successful first flight in November. These two new platforms are expected to provide differentiated appeal with customers at both ends of our product spectrum and should create significant growth opportunities for years to come.", "On the military side of Bell, the V-22 reached 250,000 flight hours during the quarter. The aircraft is performing very well for our customers, achieving outstanding mission success and deployments to Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.", "The Osprey continues to demonstrate a wide range of mission capabilities and is attracting attention from customers around the world. Most recently, Japan has indicated that it has provided for the first five of its 17-unit requirement in their 2015 budget.", "We\u2019re currently working with the U.S. government to negotiate a contract and delivery plan for this aircraft.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter we delivered 55 jets, down from 62 last year. For the full-year, we delivered 159 jets, up from last year\u2019s 139 jets. We also delivered 41 King Airs in the quarter bringing post-acquisition deliveries to 113.", "The integration of Beechcraft continues to grow extremely well which is evident in our cost productivity as Textron Aviation achieved full-year margins of 5.1%, about 200 basis points higher than the mid-point of our initial guidance.", "We\u2019ve been actively working with our new Hawker customers this past year, ensuring that they understand our commitment to support the aircraft. During the quarter, we also made progress internationally as we opened a new larger combined Hawker, Beechcraft and Cessna service center, our flagship European maintenance location at the Paris Le Bourget airport.", "In addition, we delivered the first two XLS aircraft to our Chinese joint venture at Zhuhai. Development of our new Latitude continues to go well as we now accumulated 500 test flights generating 12,000 test hours.", "Customer response to Latitude continues to be positive following its debut at NBAA. Customers in the North America are currently flying demo flights and they\u2019re impressed with the spacious stand-up cabin and $2,700 [indiscernible] range that Latitude offers. We expect Latitude deliveries will begin in the second half of this year.", "On the market front, new jet customer interest and inquiry activity has been noticeably better than a year ago. We\u2019re also encouraged that available used aircraft continues to come down, which is resulting in used aircraft moving fairly quickly and the stabilization of residual values, especially for used aircraft with low hours. On balance, we believe our best path forward at this point is to remain conservative with respect to increasing production and to continue in our path for new product developments.", "To summarize, we believe we ended the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance. And throughout the year, we took actions that should position our businesses for continued growth over the next several years.", "Textron systems began deliveries of the TCDL V2 system retrofit program and made a good progress in getting the Canadian TAPV program back on track. We advanced our Ship to Shore program and began initial production activity to support first delivery plan for 2017.", "We also signed additional international contracts Sensor-Fuzed Weapons that we expect will support production at current levels for 2016. And we\u2019re gaining traction with some of our new product platforms such as the unmanned naval mine detection system for which we won an initial U.S. Navy contract on October.", "At Industrial, our double-digit top line growth this year reflects our continuing investment in new products such as the new electric Bad Boy Recoil iS hunting vehicle and specialized vehicles and the DataScout 10G Ethernet Network Analyzer at Tools & Test.", "Industrial growth was also the result of ongoing acquisitions which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.", "At Bell, we continued to improve our win rate in the commercial helicopter markets based on attractiveness of our new and upgraded products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales business around the world.", "We\u2019re also winning on the military side as we were included among the finalist to proceed with our V-280 platform for the U.S. DOD future vertical program. We also made good progress with our cost structure as we compared to the ramp-down in military production of V-22.", "Looking to 2015, Bell top line will down overall. But we expect commercial to grow based on what we\u2019re seeing in the customer pipeline and market opportunities for the year. We expect Bell to return to overall top line growth in 2016 and \u201817 with the introduction of the new 505 and 525 models.", "Textron Aviation, we brought the Hawker, Beechcraft and Cessna brands under one roof allowing us to offer a much wider array of products and services to our customers significantly improving cost productivity.", "Looking to 2015, we anticipate moderate growth driven by our strategy and the Beech acquisition. To finish with Textron\u2019s 2015 financial guidance, we\u2019re projecting revenues of about $14.4 billion with EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $550 million to $650 million.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $398 million, up $91 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 on a $590 million increase in revenues.", "Let\u2019s look at how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $597 million from this period last year, reflecting a $556 million impact from the Beechcraft acquisition, higher volumes and favorable mix. The segment had a profit of $130 million compared to $33 million at the Cessna segment a year ago. This reflected improved performance including the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition and favorable volume mix and pricing. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, approximately flat with the end of third quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $304 million, reflecting lower V-22 and commercial deliveries. Segment profit decreased $32 million from the fourth quarter in 2013, primarily reflecting the lower volumes, partially offset by favorable performance.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $212 million, reflecting higher unmanned systems volumes and the impact of acquisitions partially offset by lower Marine and Land system volumes. Segment profit was up $10 million, reflecting the higher volumes.", "Industrial revenues increased $89 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting favorable performance and the impact of higher volumes.", "Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million and profit increased $3 million. Non-accrual accounts ended the quarter at $81 million, down $21 million from the end of the third quarter while 60 day delinquencies were $57 million, down $13 million in the quarter.", "Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $58 million and our tax rate was 25.8%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefitted from the U.S. R&D tax credit law passed late in the quarter as well as increased profits in the international jurisdictions with lower tax rates.", "Interest expense was $40 million, up from $27 million a year ago, primarily reflecting debt cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financing. During the quarter, we issued $350 million in notes and an effective rate of 3.9% and implemented an early redemption of $350 million of the existing 6.2% notes that were coming due in March of this year.", "We also repurchased 545,000 of our shares at an overall cost of about $21 million. For the full-year, we repurchased about 8.9 million shares at an overall cost of about $340 million.", "At the end of the year, with $3.1 billion in total company net debt, with gross manufacturing debt of $2.8 billion, resulting in a year-end manufacturing debt to EBITDA multiple of about 2x.", "The work we\u2019ve been doing over the past several years to strengthen our businesses and our balance sheet was recognized earlier this month by S&P with a credit rating upgrade to mid triple-B which is consistent with our targeted rating.", "Turning now to our 2015 guidance, beginning with our segments on Slide 9, at Textron Aviation, we\u2019re expecting about 9% revenue growth, bringing revenues to about $5 billion, reflecting our new product strategy and the additional two-and-half months of revenue from the Beechcraft acquisition.", "Segment margins are expected to be in range of 6.5% to 7.5%, about 200 basis points higher than 2014 at the midpoint. This includes 13 million in the remaining Beechcraft fair value step-up adjustments for 2015. At Bell, we expect overall revenues of about $4 billion, reflecting an approximate $600 million decline in military revenues, partially offset by higher commercial revenues with expected margins in the range of 11% to 12%.", "At systems, we\u2019re estimating revenues of about $1.7 billion, approximately 5% higher than last year, primarily due to growth at Marine and Land and TRU Simulation and Training. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%.", "At Industrial, we\u2019re expecting solid growth in each of our businesses resulting in 8% segment revenue growth to about $3.6 billion with estimated margins in the range of 8.5% to 9%. At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit in the range of $10 million to $15 million.", "Turning to Slide 10, we are estimating 2015 pension cost will be about $150 million, up from $128 million for 2014. This reflects a U.S. plan discount rate of 4.25%, 75 basis points lower than last year, the new mortality tables and the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition.", "However, we estimate that the P&L impact is relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis. Turning to Slide 11, R&D is expected to be approximately $600 million, up from $556 million in 2014 representing approximately 4.2% sales. We\u2019re estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year\u2019s capital expenditure of $429 million reflecting our investment in new products and geographic expansion.", "Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we\u2019re projecting about $175 million for corporate expense. 2015 interest expense is estimated at $135 million reflecting the favorable rate from our fourth quarter refinancing activity and lower interest cost related to the Beechcraft acquisition financings.", "We\u2019re assuming a tax rate of about 30% and a flat share count of about 280 million shares reflecting share repurchase to offset dilution.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, operator, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning, Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Can you talk about - I guess oil prices is just something - you talked about commercial helicopter growth, so I guess first piece is how is that affecting in Bell and then secondly, if you can talk a little bit about how that\u2019s impacting Caltech since I would presume you\u2019re going to get lower commodity cost but also have a little more FX situation there.", "Scott Donnelly", "So Sam, in terms of Bell, it\u2019s sort of at the margins. As you know, we probably are less than 10% of our commercial helicopters in the oil and gas market. Frankly, that\u2019s a number we\u2019d like to see higher. That\u2019s part of the rationality of the investment in the 525 because I do think over time that will continue to be a large market segment that we would like to participate in a bigger way.", "But at this point, it\u2019s a fairly small piece. Most of our aircraft are in service in that market or still flying to a lot of the Gulf of Mexico rigs and things like that. So I think there\u2019s probably some softness in the exploration world but in terms of our customers operating the aircraft under contract of the existing operating rigs, we haven\u2019t seen really material change in that.", "In terms of what it means from a commodity cost standpoint, most of the contracts that we have in the automotive world, we largely pass through increases and decreases on commodity, so I don\u2019t expect it to be a big swinger one way or the other.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thanks. And then just if I could follow up, Bell in Aviation, if I look relative to what you said, revenues would look like back in October versus what they were now, seemed like a shift. Did any of that shift to 2015 or can you talk a little bit about what happened on the top line with those?", "Scott Donnelly", "So if you look at Bell, certainly the commercial market was softer than we expected earlier in the year and so that accounts for the bulk of the lower revenues at Bell. As I said earlier, I do expect to see some pick-up. There\u2019s not a specific thing in this story [ph] that carry over from quarter to quarter but there certainly are a number of opportunities in the marketplace that we feel we\u2019re likely to win that would help us see a slight uptake in commercial activity in 2015 versus 2014.", "And then on the systems front, the big impact really for us on the year was the TAPV program which moved from 2014 to \u201815. And so we\u2019ll start deliveries of those systems in the latter part of this year.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Then we\u2019ll go to Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks very much. Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Robert Stallard", "Scott, before, you said it looks like the business jet environment has turned a corner. Looking forward, how long will it probably require for you to see some decent order intake before you\u2019d start contemplating rate increases?", "Scott Donnelly", "Rob, we - obviously, this is something we kind of look at on a month-to-month basis. At this point, clearly, we - if the order rate did increase and things did get appreciatively stronger, we could make some adjustments that would increase our production rates in the latter part of the year. Still, at this point, but that\u2019s really something we look at on a month-to-month basis based on realized orders.", "So it\u2019s certainly better as we said, the amount of activity. And the first quarter is never early in the year necessarily a strong time in terms of orders but the reality is a lot of the customer conversations and demos and activity that we saw in the latter part of last year led to good orders. It seems to be continuing into the first part of this year, so we definitely feel good about where it is versus a year ago but we\u2019ll probably delay here in terms of making any commitments to increase any kind of production rates until we see more of those orders actually fall into the backlog.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks. And as a follow-up, one of your competitors decided to pause development of one of their models. Do you see this as specific to the model they\u2019re working on or reflective of the broader market?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Rob, I think it\u2019s the fact that this is a very competitive segment of the market and if you\u2019ve got to make calls in terms of your prioritization, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that that\u2019s the one that you would prioritize out.", "Robert Stallard", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Then we\u2019ll go to Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Good morning, everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Jason Gursky", "Scott, I was wondering if you could just talk about the portfolio, broadly speaking, and your view on the outlook for the need to add or subtract from the portfolio and your view on the acquisition outlook and pipeline going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. Look, that\u2019s a very dynamic thing, right? I mean we\u2019re not - we sort of keep an eye out across all the businesses and look for opportunities that we think are deals that we can do, that we can make highly accretive and bring a lot of value and good leverage into the company. So clearly, if you look back at 2014, the Beechcraft deal was obviously a sizable deal.", "There\u2019s not a lot of those kind of deals that are out there but that\u2019s one that we looked at and said we think we can acquire that, integrate it and make it be good for the customers and good for our shareholders. And I think that that worked, obviously, in a smaller way in terms of the magnitude of the size of the deals.", "Over the last couple of years, the technologies of the world and the Sherman + Reilly\u2019s and the acquisitions of our simulator businesses, I think these are deals that have been good deals. And they\u2019re performing at or above our expectations and I think are bringing good value to the overall company.", "So we\u2019ll kind of keep an eye out on all fronts. And we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under any pressure to have to go do any deal. I mean most of our focus on a day-to-day basis with our businesses is very organically focused and around developing new products. But if something comes along that looks like it makes sense, we\u2019ll always take a look.", "Jason Gursky", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thanks so much. So maybe you mentioned that you expect Latitude deliveries in the second half. My recollection is you were expecting them before mid-year. Has that slipped at all? And maybe also give us an update on your larger plane, the Longitude.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So, Cai, I think we\u2019ve talked about certification that could happen here in the second quarter where I think we\u2019re still on track for that. The program is going very well. There\u2019ve been no issues, technical or otherwise. The aircraft is flying great. We\u2019re working our way through the test programs.", "The search schedule seems to be going very well. But getting all the Ts crossed and the Is dotted and when that happens in the quarter, I think at this point, we\u2019d say that means that likely if you get a second quarter cert, you\u2019re probably going to have third quarter deliveries. So if things go really well, could we pull an aircraft or two into the quarter? That\u2019s, I guess, possible.", "But at this point, our experience on getting through the final cert is - just getting through the paperwork process is not always easy, so we\u2019ll keep working hard. But the program is in great shape. It\u2019s going as we expected and we\u2019re really pleased with it.", "So in terms of Longitude, that program is ramping up pretty significantly. Teams are actively working. We think we know what the configuration of the aircraft is based on a lot of work with customers and where we are. So you\u2019ll see that really started ramping up in the latter part of last year and through all this year.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Okay. And could you give us any more color on new products in the aviation sector? Like when is Longitude going to come and do you have any other introductions we might see in the next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that we\u2019re prepared to announce it this time. I do think, Cai, that you will see a debut of the Longitude sometime in the not too distant future.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Got it, okay. Thank you very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Let\u2019s go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Frank Connor", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Noah Poponak", "Just going back to the topic of the polls [ph] you\u2019re keeping on Cessna production and the overall health of the business [share market]. Can you update us on whether or not lead times have extended for your customers since your October update or how far sold out you are and then what that number needs to be? I think in the past, you said, you wouldn\u2019t let a customer wait nine months just trying to see how close we are to getting to that point.", "Scott Donnelly", "Oh no, it\u2019s a tough question you\u2019re asking. It really does vary model by model. You know what I mean.", "Frank Connor", "Yes.", "Scott Donnelly", "We have somewhere - again we had customers that - some would have liked probably a fourth quarter delivery that is moved out in the first part of this year because we did get that sold out point on some of those aircraft.", "But generally speaking, as I said, look, we\u2019d like to be in that six to nine months. Clearly, that\u2019s not where the business is right now. But some models are - some are fairly strong in the future quarters. And others you still have availability that\u2019s within the quarter.", "Obviously when you talk about new products like the Latitude, there\u2019s order book on that but that\u2019s dated obviously by getting some certification in the first delivery. So it\u2019s --", "Noah Poponak", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "I\u2019d still - as I said, I\u2019d love to see every model sitting in that six month or so timeframe. And they\u2019re not. But I think the momentum in that direction certainly has improved over the past six months.", "Noah Poponak", "But it sounds like that hasn\u2019t really - I mean I know it\u2019s a pretty short period of time but it sounds like that hasn\u2019t really extended from your third quarter update.", "Scott Donnelly", "It has on a couple of models.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "But there are still some models that are available for sale within the quarter.", "Noah Poponak", "And do you have a projection for how many Latitudes you\u2019ll deliver this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "We don\u2019t.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. And can I ask you that same question on Bell commercial units?", "Scott Donnelly", "So we\u2019re not putting a specific number out on the Bell commercial units. No, but I would say it would be sort of up modestly from the deliveries in 2014.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s pretty much across the product line in terms different models.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. And is anything improved there from an end market perspective or did you just get a little bit easier in comparison? Or has anything changed there?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, no, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a market that honestly, we don\u2019t really know what has driven a lot of the slowdown. But people have been a little slower to commit capital. But the deals are still being talked about, right. So it\u2019s not like we had back in the business yet days where things really just kind of came to an absolute screeching halt.", "So we\u2019re certainly disappointed with the rate of order intake and sales in 2014. Opportunities are out there and discussions are happening. And I think there are still deals that are going to be done. And a lot of those I think for whatever reason, just appeared to have been delayed from \u201814. And I certainly don\u2019t think all of them are going to come through. But I think they\u2019ll - our expectation certainly is there will be more activity in \u201815 than we saw in \u201814.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hi, good morning. Thanks. In terms of Textron aviation margins into 2015, just given your underlying margin rate was about 8% in the second half, how do we think about mix in price and R&D heading into next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, Sheila, we think about price next year as probably being very slightly improved from \u201814. Mix will probably be fairly similar. I mean we already shifted in \u201814 to sort of higher ASP, larger aircraft which we saw versus \u201813.", "In terms of margin, we\u2019re expecting obviously to see good conversion on leverage. Don\u2019t forget we have almost a full first quarter of the Beech acquisition which was not in 2014. So there\u2019s almost a quarter of worth for the Beech acquisition that doesn\u2019t bring with that kind of increased leverage in terms of volume.", "But to back that out, overall, I think we feel pretty good about where the margins are going. And we\u2019ll probably see mid-20s conversion on the stuff that\u2019s really true; volume growth in 2015 versus \u201814.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Got it. And then just on cash flow looking into \u201815 again. What are the working capital assumptions on that 550 to 650 guidance? And I guess, what are you assuming happens to inventories at Bell and Cessna?", "Then just a quick follow up on that, the capital allocation question asked before. I think you had a small bolt-on in the interiors - for an interiors business in the aviation last week. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about for \u201815 the allocation of buybacks versus additional deals?", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay. In terms of Bell, I mean we are - we\u2019re still going to see some pressure around a buildup of 505 and 525 as we get into the latter part of the year. So that will pressure somewhat some of our working capital on specifically at Bell.", "In terms of the bolt-on deal, we had a - it was a UTX business that\u2019s been doing all the interiors for our aircrafts for some time. It\u2019s basically, almost entirely, our shop. I mean it really - they did a little bit of work for Bombardier. But most of the work was for Cessna and we thought we could try better productivity and better integration, frankly, with our manufacturing lines if it was something that we picked up.", "And it\u2019s nice that they were interested in disposing out. So I think we came to good terms that were good for both companies and it gives us a little more control over what\u2019s the very important part of the customer experience in terms of the interiors of the aircraft. So it\u2019s a relatively small deal. But I think a good deal for us, both financially as well as just making it better integrated with our overall manufacturing operations for our aircraft.", "In terms of the capital allocation, Sheila, we\u2019re continue to kind of focus on committing as a minimum stock buyback to prevent dilution of employee program and so we\u2019re committed to do that.", "And as you know, we\u2019ll always keep an eye out for acquisition activity. And from a stock buyback standpoint, if we think there\u2019s optimistic points in time to the course of the year to do additional buybacks, then we\u2019ll certainly do that if we think it makes sense.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Great, thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. Just a question on the balance sheet and the target leverage. I mean, I think, Frank, you had said that the rating you now have from the agency is what you\u2019re looking for. Where do you feel the kind of optimal leverage is? And I guess, second, back to Scott, when you talked about looking opportunistically on buyback or M&A, again what size of capacity do you think you have over the balance of this year to use that leverage?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. So from a leverage standpoint as I indicated, we\u2019re around the area that we\u2019re comfortable at. We think about it as 2x to 2.5x that EBITDA against manufacturing debt levels. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ve gotten into. So kind of we\u2019ll - they paid down a little bit more of the debt associated with the Beechcraft acquisitions here. But we\u2019re still pretty comfortable with our overall debt levels.", "And I think in terms of acquisition capacity, it really obviously depends on the transaction. I think we demonstrated kind of that we had capacity with the Beechcraft acquisition obviously to do something that was meaningful for the corporation to do with all debt. And kind of bring it in, drive the synergies out of it, and deleverage relatively quickly some of that debt to our performance.", "So it will very be deal-specific. But we don\u2019t feel like we are constrained relative to the types of things that we think about as being potentially available out there in the marketplace. And we would obviously finance anything appropriately to maintain the type of leverage levels that we\u2019re talking about in targeted rating categories.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks. And then for Scott just on Bell, the guidance for 2015. I think your guidance implies of the midpoint, the sort mid-high 20s, decremental margin. Maybe you have a little bit of color on how the fixed cost base at Bell, where you are of the reductions there.", "And also the impact of the ERP rollout is on the margins in \u201815 and maybe further out please.", "Scott Donnelly", "So I think if you look at the cost activities, we\u2019ve taken some pretty major restructuring over the last year and a half or so to align the business with where we expect to be particularly driven by the known volume around B22. I think we\u2019re largely there. We\u2019re always going to continue to look at cost and further cost reduction programs.", "So I think in terms of what we set out to do knowing what was going on with B22, we\u2019re there. Now obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to watch the commercial market. And any further softness or impact or not meeting expectations around commercial would lead us to do more on cost reduction. So I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can do what we need to do the structural cost of the business appropriately. And if volume further adjusts, then we\u2019ll further adjust cost.", "Julian Mitchell", "And just on the ERP, what\u2019s the effect on margins year-on-year is this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the ERP, the impact at this point is probably largely behind us. We did have a headwind, and obviously in 2014, as a result, a lot of the inventory that was built and cost that was inventoried through that process. So at this stage in the game, most of that is largely in line [ph]. The system is working. It continues to improve and I - it was a painful process but I think we ended up in a better place. So at this point, from an accounting standpoint, most of those headwinds associated with that really played itself out through 2014. So that helps us a bit as we head into 2015.", "Julian Mitchell", "Right. Thank you very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Joseph Nadol", "Thanks. Good morning. Starting on Bell, the margin was quite strong and the quarter is better than it\u2019s been for a couple of years. Is that - kind of the ERP kind of wearing off? I would have thought that the mix in Q4 with V-22 coming down would hurt you a little bit but just looking sequentially, you had a good quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, it did, Joe. And clearly, the cross-reduction activity is working. We did start to see less of a drag, I suppose, of the ERP activity now. We did have somewhat prior deliveries of V-22s than we expect to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward because we still had a little bit left of the original multiyear and then the last deliveries on the multiyear two. In general, I think what you saw was just strong performance by the business largely driven by the cost activities that they\u2019ve taken over the last couple of years.", "Joseph Nadol", "Okay. And then on the commercial front, just a push on that one more time because it does seem at odds with - in terms of the outlook for growth ops with what - that we\u2019ve seen from you guys, what we\u2019re hearing from you and also some of your competitors. Is this fleet bids that are out in the marketplace that give you some confidence? Is it one-off or twosies and threesies kind of small business orders? Is it U.S., is it international? Where are you seeing a pick-up in activity?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s sort of all of the above, Joe. I mean, obviously the fleet deals can move the needle on these things when you get a quantity buy. But it really is across the board. There\u2019s cases of two or three 412s here, two or three 412s there which are meaningful opportunities for us.", "Joseph Nadol", "Okay. And then, just finally, on the aviation margins front, a real bounce-back here, obviously. And you talked about some of the - we know some of the positives coming into 2015. You obviously beat your guidance in 2014 by a pretty significant amount. So if I were to pose it this way, what\u2019s going to prevent you from beating it by a couple of hundred basis points again in 2015? What are the pressures you\u2019re seeing? What would you say?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look, largely, the reason we had such an outperform on our - versus our guidance this year was that a lot of the synergies that we expected to get in the Beechcraft deal happened. And they happened quicker than we would have had in our plans. So we realized an awful lot of that into this year.", "So there\u2019s clearly some knock-on benefit of that as we go into 2015. And as we\u2019ve said, there\u2019s other projects and programs this coming year, although, we tend to put the cost and the benefit sort of wash [ph] in 2015. But I think the team just - they beat because they got to the synergy levels, to that run rate faster than what was in the plan.", "Joseph Nadol", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Joseph.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Mr. Sprague, your line is open. Check your mute button. We\u2019ll move on to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, with respect to R&D in the slides, you pointed out - this might be more of a correction for Bell - or sorry, Beechcraft, the $556 million full-year R&D and I think if you go back last year, you expected to do about $490 million. Is the delta there Beechcraft or is it broader than that?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, it\u2019s largely driven by the - the original guidance didn\u2019t have the Beechcraft deal in there, so it\u2019s largely driven by Beechcraft incrementals.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. And the other clarification, I guess to Joe\u2019s question, maybe when you close out the multiyear on the V-22 in the quarter, did you have a significant positive EAC [ph] that helped the margins at Bell?", "Scott Donnelly", "We did have an EAC that reflected part of the wind-down of the multiyear. So --", "Myles Walton", "But it puts [indiscernible] trend over the last couple of quarters?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think if you look at the total EAC adjustments in the quarter, and obviously you\u2019ll see the data for the total business, that wasn\u2019t inconsistent really with a typical quarter for us.", "Myles Walton", "And then the last one. Within Cessna, the mature programs versus new programs, XLS, is that softness there mostly attributable to the coming of the Latitude? And what are you broadly seeing between mature and new programs in 2015 in terms of delivery mix?", "Scott Donnelly", "So I would say fairly balanced. I mean, obviously the Latitude will give us a little bit of an uptake on the new product front. XLS is not particularly soft. I think that\u2019s a market, if you look at those two aircrafts, you\u2019ve got a significant range difference with a Latitude of 2,700 versus an XLS at around, I want to say, 2,000 to 2,100. I\u2019m just going to go off memory here. And clearly a very different price point.", "So it\u2019s - cabin size, range, all those things that generally drive differentiation between aircraft, there\u2019s a pretty big spread between an XLS and a Latitude in terms of its performance and cabin size, and as a result, correlation in price. So we really don\u2019t see the Latitude as eating into much of the XLS market segment.", "Myles Walton", "All right, thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. I wonder if you might break out - you said the book-to-bill at aviation was about 1. Scott, I was wondering if you could break out what it would have been if we took out the defense piece of Beech as well as the turboprop so we kind of just looked at the jet business.", "Scott Donnelly", "George, we\u2019re - the book to - all the backlog will be reported just as a single number. But to your point, there\u2019s going to be volatility, obviously, from quarter to quarter depending on what\u2019s going on in the market. And we had T-6 orders in the quarter for instance with Mexico which you saw but we also had T-6 sell [ph] in the quarter. So we\u2019re not going to break that number out. It\u2019s just going to be a single backlog number for the aviation segment.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then if I looked at the incremental margin and tried to make some estimates for what it would be just to Cessna by itself, Scott, it\u2019s probably around 50%. And if I look at your guidance for \u201815 between the high and the low, the incremental ranges from 21 to 33. So to your point, the midpoint is in the mid 20s. Can you walk through kind of the drivers for the 21 to 33 next year and what doesn\u2019t recur in this quarter with the - what looks like 50%? And I recognize part of it is I\u2019m taking out Beech and Beech is in your numbers for next year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, George, I want to make sure I follow along. When we look at leverage on kind of incremental, which is how we generally look at it, we\u2019ve been kind of sitting on that - it was actually - it was pretty high from Q2 to Q3, it was a little lower from Q3 to Q4. And we always have, again, that volatility, we have more cost around SG&A in Q4 with the NBAAs, and again, a lot of ramp on the R&D side particularly on Longitude, obviously continue flight testing on Latitude.", "So we kind of look at this on a total year-over-year basis, so if you look at our guidance for next year and you backed out the incrementals of the first quarter of Beechcraft, which is additive, I would say, as opposed to leverage, we still think and we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to probably sit somewhere in that mid-20s of leverage on the volume. And it\u2019s pretty much across the whole product line. It\u2019s not particularly mix-sensitive. Our gross margins are pretty good across the whole line of products. So I think the midpoint of where we are looks at about a 25% leverage on that incremental volume on a year-over-year basis.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay.", "Operator", "Let\u2019s go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ron Epstein", "Hey, Scott. Good morning, guys. Maybe changing gears just a little bit. Scott, there\u2019s been a bunch of press lately - not a bunch, but some press lately about potential Scorpion deals with the UAE, maybe even Nigeria. I was wondering if you can give us any color, broadly speaking, on what\u2019s going on with that program and international interest.", "Scott Donnelly", "So there is still significant international interest. We have conversations ongoing with several customers. There\u2019s starting to be some reasonable RFI and RFPs sort of formal activity of countries that are looking at replacing the exact kinds of aircraft that we anticipated this aircraft would address in terms of the market. So we feel pretty good about that part of the uptake obviously in R&D as we go into 2015 as we\u2019ve had a very successful series of flight test programs through 2014, some good customer demos and sort of debuted the aircraft at Farnborough and Riyadh.", "We certainly expect that stuff to continue in 2015 and we\u2019ll be at a point now where we expect to be responding formally to some customers\u2019 RFPs. We are proceeding with the manufacturer of the first conforming aircraft so that we\u2019re ready to enter into certification testing. And so that\u2019s why you see a little bit - part of the increase in R&D from an overall company standpoint reflects our commitment to move forward on the program.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. And then maybe just one more broad one on the biz jet market. Given some of the troubles that your competitor to the north has had, you\u2019ve seen the Lear 85 get paused, whatever that means, so that\u2019s, I guess, out of the market for a while. Have you seen much irrational competition given that there\u2019s some discussion that Bombardier needs to generate cash?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look, I mean our sales force will always tell you it\u2019s always the other guy that\u2019s being irrational. Of course, I mean this is just the nature of selling but yes, we think we\u2019ve seen some top [ph] pricing in some places. But frankly, over the last year or so, I would say there\u2019s been kind of a stabilization.", "So each of the products that\u2019s out there in the marketplace has kind of achieved a price point and I think that\u2019s been pretty stable over the last year or so. We\u2019d like to see higher, obviously, but it\u2019s a competitive marketplace.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our final question will come from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "Good morning, guys. Scott, I just want to follow up on the Citation XLS again one more time. I mean deliveries went down pretty sharply this year especially the fourth quarter. Did that surprise you, I guess, is my question? And just directionally into 2015, are we at kind of a new lower level now or maybe is China going to help pick that up?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean we saw the first couple of XLSs into China obviously. I do think overall our year in \u201814 was skewed towards the new products like the new Sovereign Plus being out there, the X-Plus being out there and so I think that had clearly some influence to the market. But I would expect XLS Plus - again, the demand we see would - it should be pretty stable.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay. And then just a last one. Could you give a sense of what sense the aftermarket grew in 2014 and 2015 expectations?", "Scott Donnelly", "Our aftermarket businesses are growing around mid single-digits and I would expect that that\u2019s where they\u2019ll continue to be.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay, thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Doug Wilburne", "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. And, Gail, if you\u2019ll share the replay information, we\u2019d appreciate that. Good day.", "Operator", "And, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being made available for replay after 10 am Eastern time today through April 27th at midnight.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "At this time I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks Stan, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.1 billion, up $226 million from last year's first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.46 per share up $0.31 from the first quarter of 2014.", "Textron Aviation operating results included a $5 million reduction to segment profit from fair value step-up adjustments to acquire Beechcraft inventories sold during the quarter.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $20 million was a $125 million use of cash compared to $111 million use of cash in last year's first quarter.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up nearly 8% in the quarter reflecting the success of our strategy of investing in new products and acquisitions. We achieved this increase in topline of Textron despite an expected decrease in revenues at Bell.", "Decline in revenues at Bell was primarily due to lower volumes in our V-22 program where we delivered 6 V-22s down from 8 aircraft a year ago. We also delivered 4 H-1 aircraft down from 5 units in last year's first quarter. So it was just timing on the H-1s as we still expect to deliver about 25 units for the full year.", "On the commercial side we delivered 35 aircraft up from 34 a year ago, where our mix was unfavorable as strength in the wide end of the market was offset by softness in the medium segment with no 412 deliveries in the quarter.", "Based on the continued softness in the medium segment of the market, we are adjusting production levels and taking additional cost actions to allow Bell to perform within its targeted 2015 segment margin range of 11% to 12%.", "We still expect the commercial deliveries will be up this year but probably only modestly so given the current demand environment. While the medium segment remains challenging, our win rate continues to be favorable and we had an especially good success at Heli-Expo where we signed 238 orders in production aircraft including a 200 deal order from Air Methods for our new 407 GXP model.", "At the show we also signed 29 letters of intent for the 525 Relentless and 24 for the 505 Jet Ranger X. In addition to HAI orders, we received an order for seven 412s from the Canadian Coast Guard which we expect begin delivering in 2016 and announced two orders totaling 31 407s from customers in the Middle East and Mexico reflecting success in international markets.", "We also celebrated opening of two new regional sales and service offices in Tokyo and Abu Dhabi to better serve our customers in those regions.", "On the new product front, we continue to make progress on our safety of flight testing with the 525 Relentless test aircraft and are expecting first flight soon. Development of our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also proceeding well with the second flight test aircraft now in the air.", "We are also in our promising developments on the military side of Bell in the quarter. First the V-22 was included in the U.S. presidential budget for the Navy carrier on-board delivery mission which calls for 44 aircraft. This will provide a solid basis for a third multi-year contract beginning in the 2020 time frame.", "The Japanese V-22 program continues to move forward as we were in country last month meeting with the customer and expect contract signature this summer. Deliveries could begin in late 2018.", "We are also seeing foreign opportunities take form for the H-1s as the U.S. State Department announced its approval of potential sale of 15 AH-1Z Vipers to Pakistan.", "So while we continue to see lingering weakness in the medium helicopter segment, we believe the growth outlook at Bell over the next several years remains strong driven by our expanded global commercial sales efforts, recent commercial product upgrades, new commercial products on the way and foreign military opportunities for both the V-22 and the H-1.", "Moving to systems, as expected revenues were also down in the quarter primarily driven by lower vehicle deliveries. However we are making good progress in our Canadian TAPV program and believe we are still on track for initial deliveries in the fourth quarter. We are also working on a number of additional foreign opportunities as we contribute to fourth quarter vehicle delivers.", "At Textron's Marine and Land Systems we were awarded an $84 million contract for two additional Ship-to-Shore Connector units to be delivered in 2019 with the original two units scheduled to go offline in 2017 and 2018.", "Moving down to Land Systems we were awarded a contract for 10 additional TCDL V2 Shadow retrofit system as well as a number of additional contract for our fee per service platform.", "At TRU Simulation and Training last month, we unveiled our Bell V-280 simulator at the Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit giving you army leadership and users tangible hands on experience of this revolutionary capabilities of the new platform.", "Moving to industrial, we saw a 9.4% increase in revenues after a 7.7% negative impact from foreign exchange reflecting increase volume in our automotive markets, the success of new product programs, and the impact of the TUG, Douglas Equipment, and Dixie Chopper acquisitions.", "At Jacobsen, we introduced our new trucks to HD heavy duty utility vehicle for the choice of gas or diesel engine and over 3500 pounds of payload for most powerful utility vehicle available in this class and provides compelling new product in the Jacob portfolio.", "In the Tools & Test business, Sherman + Reilly introduced a number of new products including a revolution series P-1400, the first of its kind in 14,000 pound electric power for lines and a new line of termination tools for the power line industry.", "Operating results were also by as far industrial in the quarter as the higher volumes contributed to a year-over-year margin increase of 110 basis points.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, in the quarter we delivered 30 free jets compared to 35 last year, as well as 25 King Air. Margins in the aviation segment continue to improve reflecting our expanded scale and efficiency improvements.", "On the service front aviation during the quarter we extended our ProAdvantage Jet aftermarket support programs to Hawker customers, plus added to our King Air service footprint with certifications in Sacramento and Paris.", "Development on our new Latitude remains on pace for FA certification in the second quarter, as the flight test program is now complete and we should be on track for Latitude deliveries in the third quarter.", "The availability of used Citations continues to come down, with used aircraft under 10 years old declining to 1.6% of the active fleet. Used aircraft are continuing to move fairly quickly and we've also seen evidence of improving residual values especially for aircraft at low hours.", "New jet demand is usually seasonally lighter in the first quarter, the customer interest and inquiry activity was relatively healthy and consistent with our outlook for the year. To sum up at this point in the year we\u2019re confirming our full year Textron guidance for both earnings and cash flow as we expected stronger results at Textron aviation and industrial will offset the lower volume at Bell.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $259 million, up $40 million from the first quarter 2014 on a $226 million increase in revenues.", "Let's look at how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviations, revenues were up $266 million from this period last year, primarily reflecting the impact from the Beechcraft acquisition.", "The segment had a profit of $67 million compared to $14 million a year ago. This was driven by improved performance reflecting the impact of the Beechcraft acquisition and higher overall volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, $99 million lower than at the end of the fourth quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $60 million primarily reflecting lower V-22 deliveries. Segment profit decreased $20 million from the first quarter in 2014, primarily reflecting lower military volume and an unfavorable mix of commercial aircraft deliveries in the quarter.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were down $48 million primarily due to lower Marine and Land Systems volumes. Segment profit was down $11 million, reflecting the lower volumes.", "Industrial revenues increased $75 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $62 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $16 million, reflecting the higher volumes.", "Finance segment revenues decreased $7 million and profit increased $2 million. Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $42 million and our tax rate was 30.4%. Interest expense was $33 million, down $2 million from the first quarter of 2014.", "To wrap up with guidance, we estimate that our announced cost reduction activities at Bell will result in pre-tax charges in the range of $40 million to $50 million which will be recorded as part of segment expenses.", "Inclusive of the charges related cost savings and lower expected revenues, we still expect full year margins at Bell will be in the 11% to 12% range.", "From a total Textron perspective, stronger results at Textron Aviation and industrial are expected to offset lower volume at Bell. Therefore we are confirming expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.30 to $2.50 of share and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of 550 million to 650 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Dan we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland", "Hi, good morning gentlemen.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Carter Copeland", "Frank, just a clarification or, maybe, if you could give us a little more detail, on the charges for the cost actions at Bell, obviously $40 million, $50 million, if you still think you're going to come in within the prior range, I was just wondering if there was something other than run rate savings there would apply a lot of savings? Is there something else as an upper that's helping you overcome that $40 million, $50 million or am I missing something?", "Frank Connor", "No, its really run rate savings in the way that then gets rolled through the EAC's from a cost reduction standpoint. So obviously, we will have headcount savings, we will have rate savings, we are doing other things on the discretionary side as well.", "And, when you look at those savings from a program accounting standpoint, as well as the cost, it will roll through such that we don\u2019t expect any big, kind of impact in any particular quarter and what we should see is the generally kind of the same type of seasonality from a quarterly standpoint as we've seen Bell over the past couple of years with improving margins as we go through the year in a higher volumes but it will get spread out over that period of time.", "Carter Copeland", "Can you quantify how much of that is the EAC keum catches that is you'll get out of that for this year?", "Frank Connor", "Well, its not really kind of keum catch its just, as we - there will be a little bit of keum catch but it's mostly as we deliver, product will have lower cost, embedded in those products. We\u2019re on a unit to delivery basis and so it rolls through as we deliver units.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, great. Then just one other one. With respect to the market softness, you talked about, Scott, the -- I wondered if there is any after-market service support impact in Bell related to the weakness -- it's probably related to lower usage, that you might be seeing in Bell as well?", "Scott Donnelly", "We\u2019re trying to keep an eye on that and have some concern about but in the quarter our aftermarket activity was fine and we continue to see order activity. So, utilization still seems to be okay, I think we really seen is, more people just being a little nervous about investing the new CapEx and putting a new aircraft and to replace a older aircraft but at least today utilization and aftermarket seems to be fine.", "Carter Copeland", "All right. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyauglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyauglu", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Scott, how should we think about the progression of the backlog within Aviation? When can we start to see that move up a bit?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think Sheila the thing is most likely to start impact our backlog here in the balance of the year is, getting through certification on Latitude, which as I said I think we\u2019re getting pretty close, we done the flight test, we're done with all the ground test activities or at this point we\u2019re really just into the paperwork exercises getting through that.", "So as a result, we now have a couple of aircraft that we've recently been able to put out, we really dedicated to customer demo activities those aircraft are pretty booked up. So we think there is a lot demand up there for the aircraft, a lot of customer interest and now that we can really dedicate those assets to getting out there and doing customer demos and we would expect to see those orders start to finalize.", "Sheila Kahyauglu", "Okay. Are you sold out for any particular models throughout this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "It's pretty tight on a couple but if you really want to one we could probably work with you somewhere.", "Sheila Kahyauglu", "I'll ask Doug for a favor. Then, I guess on underlying margins within Aviation, if we compare the first half of last year versus the quarter, about 200 basis points of underlying improvement excluding the PP&A. Should we expect that kind of improvement as we progress throughout the year, or could you attribute that to pricing? Was it Beech? Was it productivity? Maybe if you could just elaborate a bit there? ", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that\u2019s probably going to be typical for the year. I think the volumes, we expect to be online with what we\u2019re expecting from the beginning of the year, we got a slide uptick, we think on a year-over-year basis on the King Air which we are doing well. So I think the trajectory on is, going to track a couple hundred basis points better.", "Sheila Kahyauglu", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. Good morning. Scott, I was wondering on the orders, if you could just go out and talk a little bit about where the strength is? US versus international, are you seeing any impact negatively internationally because of the dollar, so a little more color on that, if you could?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think the dollar is a problem George and in some parts of world obviously because of the - I mean the dollars has strengthened so much and obviously in some markets, particularly Eastern Europe and Russia where you had a lot of devaluation and similarly in South America there is just great a lot of problem.", "But I would say in general right now on the jet side of things, the market is very driven by the North American marketplace, probably something around two-thirds to 80, 20 and interestingly enough its almost exactly inverted if you looked at King Air's.", "So the strength of the turboprop market has been more international, the U.S. market still good, there has been more demand internationally. So, total portfolio it's going to balancing out a bit but definitely on the jet business its much more North American centric and King Air more international.", "George Shapiro", "Then, in Bell on the commercial, is the weakness, would you say, totally due to the oil and gas market or is there something else going on?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think its mostly related to that George and certainly part of its is direct, right. So I mean if you\u2019re talking about customers whose mission is flying specifically oil and gas missions out the rigs, clearly that market is very soft right now given the price of oil.", "But I think for us a bigger knock on effect of that is that historically we see a lot of sales, a lot of our aircraft particularly 412s in emergency medical services, and CSAR and a lot of sort of quasi-military, government operations and a lot of those countries that have very strong oil economies are seeing a lot of CapEx in their budget.", "So I think, there is a piece of it that is absolutely directly oil and gas but I think part its \u2013 been a bigger issue for us is just a lot of our customer, our oil and gas natural resource driven economies and they're soft right now.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. One quick last one for Frank, what was the aftermarket growth at Aviation?", "Frank Connor", "It was mid single digits and kind of consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing and expect to continue to see.", "George Shapiro", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about industrial. Just, it looks like sales and margins are certainly running ahead. I know you mentioned auto strength, but where is the higher volume? Is it the specialty vehicles business, like what is it that's driving things this year?", "Frank Connor", "Probably on a absolute dollar basis, the biggest increase is in the automotive side. We certainly seeing good auto demand, but we've also seen very strong earns from the vehicle business, that's such organically the business is growing nicely, but then of course we also have technologies and the acquisition side for ground support equipment that acquisition is performing extremely well for us. We're seeing great topline and great margin delivery out of that as well.", "So it\u2019s kind of - I\u2019d say the good news is, it's pretty broad. The organic growth of the businesses in product lines that we were in has been very solid and the acquisitions we've done on that base are also performing very well.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. Then just a question on the finance slide, the 60-plus-day delinquencies, why did those increase sequentially? I know it's not large dollars, but it's certainly a large percentage change?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, that's true. And look we had a couple of customer accounts that moved into that 60 day window and we have a little bit of loss small numbers now right. So if 412 aircrafts become a problem, we can swing that percentage by a pretty good chunk even though it might be two airplanes and $20 million makes a big difference from a percent basis.", "So, I don\u2019t think there is any fundamental underlying change there. I mean clearly some customers internationally, because of some of the issues around U.S. dollar and currency and what not, those payments have got little expensive. And so obviously we\u2019ll work through that and in general I think we\u2019ll be fine.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. Last question, just on the $600 million in free cash this year, I know you've talked about at a minimum buying back enough stock to offset the employee programs. One is, how much buyback is required to do that? Then, what would it take for you to do more? You don't really have any other debt maturing, so I'm just trying to think about where else does it go?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. We will buyback to offset the programs it's about 3 million shares or so. And as we talked about, we will - obviously we continue to look at acquisition opportunities and we have kind of - have had a steady stream with those.", "And we have expected we will pay down a little bit more of the bank debt that we took on as it related to the Beechcraft acquisition, and then we\u2019ve said kind of any excess capital after that we would look to continue again to return to shareholders through share repurchase activity. But the target from the share repurchase standpoint is to offset the employee dilution number.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Hi, thank you. Just a question around any change in the competitive landscape. In Aviation and in Sikorsky, you obviously have some competitors based in countries where the dollar has strengthened considerably against their local base, so how does -- has that changed anything yet you're seeing commercially? Also, there are obviously some idiosyncratic issues at a couple of rivals of yours right now. I just wondered if you'd seen any change from that as well?", "Frank Connor", "I mean the dollar is not helpful for sure from a competitiveness standpoint and I think that some of our European competitors do get an advantage out of that. Of course they also have a fair bit of those supply chain that is dollar denominated so it\u2019s not of a disadvantage as it could be.", "But when we look at deals in Europe for instance right now, it does make it more challenging, but again that's just the nature of a competitive market these things swing around. I think if you look at Latin America and Eastern Europe, Russia, the currency devaluation makes it a challenge for both dollar and euro denominated business, just because of the currency devaluation.", "But either anyway I think, I would not say that it has markedly changed what\u2019s going on it makes it certainly tougher in Europe, but I mean I think we\u2019re still winning and feel really good about where we are from a share perspective.", "When you look at deals in Asia, we\u2019re competitive and we are winning. So I think even though the helicopter market in particular, we see as being pretty soft I\u2019d say that we feel very good about our order rate this year in terms of share I think we\u2019re doing quite well.", "Julian Mitchell", "That's very helpful. Then, my second question is just on the Systems, the revenues were weak, but it sounded like very much in line with your planning assumption. It doesn't sound like your full-year view has changed on that segment, so I just wondered if you could confirm that? Also any color at all on the linearity of the sales progression? Is it going to be a very, very Q4-loaded year at Systems because of the TAP 3 delivery schedule, or do we start to see things improve a bit by mid year?", "Frank Connor", "Well I think you will see things improve a bit by mid-year Julian but absolutely our expectations and where we think it\u2019s going will be very back end loaded and that really primarily is driven by the vehicle program.", "So we clearly expect and we think we're on track to have a pretty big fourth quarter on the vehicle side of the business.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. Give us a little more color on demand at Aviation? You say customer demand is quote/unquote healthy, and yet 0.85 book-to-bill hardly looks like healthy. How was it at Cessna versus legacy Beech? How did it roll out sequentially, since we've heard that January and February were very weak and March improved?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I think the normal seasonality is sort of demand is inline with our expectations I guess what I would say Cai. The early first quarter is always very soft from an order intake perspective.", "And I think that's what we saw for the most part this year. On a seasonal basis, it's performing exactly as we would have expected I think we probably said in terms of customer activity and what not as strong as we've seen in a while in Q1.", "And we're pretty happy with how things were progressing. Obviously as I said earlier, I think the real demand driver for us in terms of any kind of backlog filled would be around Latitude as that thing goes through it\u2019s certification process.", "So even though the customer environment is considerably better than it has been, it is still sort of a full business people are in conversations, and as they get close to when they want to take deliveries that's when they put their deposit down and sign up.", "So as we said we\u2019d love to be out in three to six months and we certainly have a couple of models where it's out in more in that range, but generally speaking it\u2019s still more of a full business.", "But with a lot more customers are sort of in the queue and a lot more conversations going around to yield, what we need to see in terms of deliveries and so frankly we feel pretty comfortable with that.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Given that Cessna depends on the US, where the economy is improving somewhat, and Beech depends on the foreign market, where there's less evidence of that, could you contrast demand between those two sectors?", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, they really been pretty similar. I think if you look at how deals progress the number of customers that we are in conversations, when they actually placed their orders and take deliveries as you point out it is more international on the King Air side and domestic on the Jet side but still a very similar prospecting, selling order taking selling process for both platforms.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Okay. Then, two quick ones on Bell. You said commercial up a bit. Would that include the 412? Secondly, if you're going to have $40 million to $50 million of pretax charges, how much would the run rate savings be against that?", "Scott Donnelly", "So in terms of the unit deliveries, we still think that will be up slightly over a year ago primarily driven by higher volumes on 407s and 429s, offset by probably slightly lower volumes on 412 versus last year, which is why we come back to the mix issues what prefers the margins out of the spring. So, we're still feeling reasonably good about volumes on the lights but clearly not so on the mediums.", "In terms of the cost and that roll through, I mean I would say most of the cost is related to severances and reductions of people and so generally speaking if you forget program accounting and inventory and all that sort of stuff, you generally expect that those costs will be covered in sort of a 9-month window obviously how you recognize that see through the P&L is going to be more function of the program accounting and EACs and how that comes.", "So Frank said, you will see not a whole lot of impact on a quarter-to-quarter basis through the balance of the year because while we will take the cost source of restructuring, that will manifest itself in program accounting where you won\u2019t see much difference in terms of the net impact through the balance of this year and obviously as you go out in time, you would start to see positive benefit there.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Peter Skibitski", "Scott, I think you mentioned secondhand pricing in used jets, in your opening remarks, being maybe modestly improved. Can you tell us, is the improvement rolling through to meet pricing on some of the legacy models, or is that some kind of a flash environment and you just get a pricing power on the brand-new models?", "Scott Donnelly", "Both we\u2019ve seen pricing fairly stable on the new models, we\u2019ve seen beginning of some uptick of residual values in the used aircraft, as you see in Vrefs and the blue books which is encouraging.", "I don\u2019t know that there is a direct correlation frankly to saying okay the prices up on the used and therefore it translates directly to price on the new. It does help us in terms of customer's that wants to trade in their old aircraft or sell their old aircraft and step up into new aircraft.", "In terms of that gap and value between what they know that they can get for their used aircrafts and how much additional capital they would want to put into buy new airplanes. So as we see those residual values starting to rebound, I think it definitely bodes well for demand on the new aircraft side.", "Peter Skibitski", "Okay. Understood. Then, just wanted to follow up. I don't know how widespread this was, but I saw at least one article during the quarter that talks about a lot of nervousness on the TAPV program in Canada, just on the redesign. Can you tell us when is the redesign going to be done and fully tested? How thorough is this, such that it could eliminate the risk in the program?", "Scott Donnelly", "The redesign is complete and we have had initial vehicles with the redesign fully incorporated into them and all going through the test environment, so we\u2019re as we were doing the redesign, these things were all fairly well isolated to during suspension system which basically just we said to beef it up the severity of the conditions of the test were frankly beyond anything that we\u2019ve experienced before.", "We have a lot of these vehicles out there obviously of various different types and we\u2019ve never had issues or problems with any of those components. But the severity of the testing frankly pushed some of these things literally break some of these steering numbers.", "So the redesign was in essence just beefing up those individual components, most of which are available and used in some larger vehicles interestingly enough, and in some cases there were actually cheaper than the lighter version because they are manufactured in high volumes.", "And so we have been sort of testing each of these new components as we could get our hands on them and those have gone well as I said we now have couple of vehicles out there that are completely the new design configuration with all of the new configuration components.", "And the testing so far is going great, so it is an endurance test, right so you have to get through that phase which will take us another couple of months before we\u2019re comfortable enough to say we are ready to go into the formal customer testing, but so far the design is complete and initial testing results are very promising.", "Frank Connor", "Okay. That feedback I would add that article fits that one that I am thinking of I think if you read it closely lot of the information and quotes in that article are really from last year, it\u2019s really not current data.", "Scott Donnelly", "It was quite dated and this customer has been terrific to work with I think everybody has had their head around same thing and want to make sure we went back to the process so it\u2019s test was successful and the sort of the tone in the article is pretty dated.", "Peter Skibitski", "Okay. I appreciate you guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi, good morning everyone. Scott, are you surprised that the legacy, not new products Cessna demand environment is not getting better faster. Because, I guess it's been a few quarters since you first cited stabilization, you keep giving us the inventory as a percentage of fleet number for you, and it's improved a lot, and I don't even know if that could go any lower. Is there just too much total market used inventory, so you're still competing with everyone else's used inventory? Or is it just a long-cycle business and it takes time to get escape velocity, or is this market just at a structurally new lower demand level for a while?", "Scott Donnelly", "No I think that I mean the numbers I should say are down in terms of the used available, it\u2019s kind of hard to imagine they could go much lower frankly they are certain well below historical norms. The only thing I would say is that they still have probably a relatively higher spread between what the values are for those used aircraft as opposed to new aircraft and I think that\u2019s still is a drag on some of our customers because trade in premium right to say if I go from the used to the new, how much cash flow I have to kick in to do that is higher than it\u2019s historically been.", "And so I still think the every placement cycle people will drag that out just given that that value gap if you were but the aircraft still keep getting older and they\u2019re using more and I think have this longer timeline in terms of how many years older aircraft before they trade in.", "And I think that is the primary dynamics still driving the marketplace, that\u2019s what I think we have been talking out for couple of years really about the percentage coming down and coming down and coming down, the past quarter so is really the first time we are starting to see that residual value come up.", "So I think that actually is more important and just that percentage and frankly we\u2019ve been surprised that with such a low inventory used aircraft you think from a supply demand standpoint you would start to see pricing come up.", "And at least for final you will see that okay we have been surprised frankly probably the last year as that number really started to drop that you didn\u2019t see a corresponding residual value increase and like you said finally we\u2019re starting to see that which is encouraging. And I think that\u2019s what is driving that kind of demand environment.", "Noah Poponak", "On the upgrading topic, is there also an issue with length of time the jet is with the first owner, where in prior cycles because of the maintenance warranty being five years you were getting a ton of upgrading in years four and five? Now folks are extending that because, obviously, a plane can be used substantially longer, and once you go past the roll off of the maintenance warranty and you do that first major check, you then have signed up for keeping the airplane for a lot longer until you get to the next major check. Is that overall time an issue?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I think the time is clearly being extended and what you\u2019re seeing is more customers get to the end of that warranty period were historically would have said okay, I am going to go ahead and trade in but again you back to that what the step up cost, what is that premium to go from that five rolled aircraft to brand new aircraft and instead you\u2019re seeing people that are sticking with it, putting part programs and we do provide obviously for customers and always have for second customers the ability to in essence extend warranties and pay to sort of protect themselves from those cost which is a good business for us.", "So this is I think this all comes back in order to basic dynamic of all right five years whether it would be coming of warranty, whether it is how many hours, whether it is just going to larger lift it\u2019s extending that period because that residual value is just substantially lower than it historically has been.", "Noah Poponak", "Got it. Then, just lastly, on the margin for the overall aviation segment, I mean, you have an outstanding margin forecast for the year, could you possibly update us on that? Just because it looks like with the very good first-quarter performance, one can get substantially higher than that range you have there, just even simply using a 20% sequential incremental margin through the rest of the year. Any more color on where you expect the full year to land?", "Scott Donnelly", "No formal update, all as I said and as I think Frank referenced I think will at least feel like given the demand environment and the performance in the business in total and I mean we\u2019re still early in the year obviously right but I mean our perspective on the market and certainly our perspective on how the team is executing and delivering on cost and product programs will probably be towards the high side of that number.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good morning. Frank or Scott, I think you alluded to the service extension to offer customers. I was curious if you'd talk about the level of uptick you're seeing on that extension of your service program? Also, one year post the Hawker acquisition, can you comment on the level of cross totalization you've had in bringing customers over to the Cessna lineup? Any metrics you have against that to support it?", "Frank Connor", "Well, we have a dedicated team frankly that this is what they do for living is reaching out to our Hawker customers, part of what we just talked about around our ProAdvantage system being able to go out to those customers and be able to put them on the same kind of maintenance and service programs that we currently have today for our citation customers.", "And that program and the needs of those customers, is what kind of droves that, creation of that program based on interactions that our dedicated Hawker team has had with those customers.", "In terms of conversion that\u2019s also something we look at and are working on and we certainly have had. Some of those and I would expect frankly, when you talk to a lot of Hawker customers many of whom are in Hawker 900s and 850 things like that, these are cabin sizes and mission that did quite well to where we are talking about going with Latitude and ultimately longitude.", "So I think most of that conversion will start becoming more material as we have a Latitude and then eventually launched at the marketplace.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Then a clarification. From a sales perspective, it sounds like Bell may be looking for $4 billion roughly at the start of the year and maybe it's a few hundred million lighter than that, is that about the right thinking?", "Frank Connor", "That's probably right.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. All right, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Johnny Wright from Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Johnny Wright", "Hi, guys. About the restructuring points again, you guys saw a lot of money there in the last 12 to 18 months taking costs out. How confident are you that there's another $40 million to $50 million to keep you in that guidance range? Where are the new areas you're focusing on that you haven't looked before?", "Scott Donnelly", "You're right, we\u2019ve gone through a number restructuring as frankly over the last couple of years in anticipation of the V-22 volumes coming down. I think all this really changed here is that while we were undertaking to try to make sure we had a cost structure that supported that, we have seen the soft on the commercial side.", "So I don\u2019t know if there is any particularly different strategy here obviously, we\u2019re looking very much at structure and looking at organization structure to try in more efficient ways to operate given that it\u2019s a small business in terms of its revenue in topline,.", "So it's primarily around, structure and layers overhead. We are not impacting our critical programs, so the investments in 525 and 505 and V-280 which are significant, those are continuing full speed ahead.", "So it\u2019s never an easy go process to go through obviously but we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that the cost come out in places that are discretionary or other overhead and indirect burden as oppose to effecting how we manufacture and deliver what we need to and make sure that we continue to make kind of progress on our new product programs.", "Johnny Wright", "Okay. Thanks. Can you just provide an update on the Scorpion? Where we are at terms of timing for first orders, maybe just a number of customers you're in conversation with at this point?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, there is a number of customers in conversation right now. I would say that the number of customers who we are talking to is probably increasing at this point. I wouldn\u2019t hassle to guess a first order date at this stage of the game but I think we have a lot of good customer conversations going on, like program is continuing, we\u2019re in the process of completing the design modifications that we wanted to make coming out of the original flight test demo program and are in the process of the build cycle for what will lead to the first confirming aircraft. So that\u2019s kind of where we are in the program.", "Johnny Wright", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "I think you've covered a lot of ground here. I guess a couple things. On Latitude, can you give us the sense of to what degree you do have some orders in hand? Obviously, you're indicating that once you think you've got final cert it picks up, but any color you can provide there?", "Scott Donnelly", "So we do have a number of orders for the Latitude Jeff. I think we\u2019re in pretty good place, in terms of initial delivery commitments, customers that are waiting for us to get through certainly begin the delivery process.", "But there are still some slots obviously to go for the year but as I said, I think we have a very robust level of customer interest and a bunch of folks that are waiting the demo and fly the aircraft at that point make there decision on order.", "So having now finish the flight test program or have a couple aircraft flying around the country, fully configured for customer interiors, its pretty booked up. So I think there is a lot of interest, a lot of customers, but they all want to, they want to fly the aircraft, we obviously done a number of customer demos, we had in aircraft, that we have there for while doing demos and that generated more activity and I think we are at that point now in the program where that pace will increase.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Then, just taking that a step further, you had this mix down in Q1 and it's obviously a low-volume quarter. I understand the Latitude mission is obviously different Sovereign and XLS the capabilities are different, but is there some peripheral cannibalization of those product lines, you think, on anticipation of Latitude?", "Scott Donnelly", "The only thing I can figure out Jeff is that from a mix standpoint, last year in Q1, we've just gotten the Sovereign plus certification in the very, very end of 2013. So we had a lot of Sovereign deliveries in first quarter of 2014.", "So I think we had good Sovereign deliveries in the first quarter of this year but not something that would reflected - sort so that pent-up demand given the late certification of Sovereign a year ago.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Sure, that makes sense. One last one. Just back on Bell, you hit it a couple times here in the Q& A. It sounds like on the restructuring you're telling us that effectively all or most of that $40 million to $50 million gets recovered, so you're close to net-net neutral on cost versus benefit on restructuring. A, is that correct? Then B, if I just think about that being a wash, I'm still struggling a little bit with getting from 9% and change in Q1 to 11% to 12% for the year. Obviously there's some seasonal volume lift, but is there anything else in the mix or anything that really supports your confidence in that range?", "Scott Donnelly", "There is. So first of all your assumption is correct with respect to the discussion around, the incurring of the restructuring charges and what that does on sort of a net basis through the balance of the year. Okay, so that\u2019s more or less a wash.", "In terms of, sort of how we think about quarterly progression of margins, generally speaking as we work through the year at Bell, we do see increased volumes and we do see more favorable mix.", "So in the first quarter is that we had zero 412s. So we would expect the quarterly progression of margin rate, given that the restructuring and the balance sort of that net out, you will sort of the normal incremental improvements in margin rate through the course of the year.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question does come from the line of David Strauss from UBS. Please go ahead.", "David Strauss", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning, David.", "David Strauss", "Scott, could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of utilization on your own fleet that's out there in service? Obviously, we can see the FAA data, but I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of the utilization on your own fleet as it comes in for service? Does that -- are you seeing a pickup there? It looks like the FAA did. It picked up earlier in the year, but now has fallen back. Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "David, I guess, I don't have that around the supplementary forms here. We usually keep track of the average flight hours and then I don\u2019t know if I have that in front of me. Usually what the FA is reporting is take-off and landings and we usually look at the average daily utilization. So there hasn't been a huge change in that frankly, I mean it's sort of in the realms.", "David Strauss", "Do you think that's the missing piece in all of this? I know we've talked about used inventories and used pricing, but do you think it's really possible that we can have much of a recovery before we see a pick up in average daily utilization?", "Frank Connor", "I don't know that there's a huge correlation from the ADU to the new aircraft sale. I really think that is more a basis of residual values versus new aircraft sale. We look at the ADUs more as a function of service activity and how much activity we\u2019re going to through see to the service centers.", "And again that\u2019s been relatively stable with sort of its get older and it\u2019s all base get bigger that's what's been driving our guidance around sort of that mid single-digit growth and that's where we continue to see even though we had relatively stable ADU now for quite sometime.", "David Strauss", "Is that ADU number still well below what you guys were seeing prior to the financial crisis?", "Frank Connor", "Sure, yes, if you went back and you looked at, it dropped off, at the end of the 2008 beginning of 2009 in the sort of the 0.67, 0.65, 0.64 I mean it's been pretty flat for several years now.", "David Strauss", "Right. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jon Raviv", "Hi, good morning. It's Jon Raviv on for Jason. Question back on Bell. I was just wondering, is there more to cut, perhaps, if this oil market weakness continues? Related to that is, do you have any visibility on 412 deliveries this year? My understanding is that this is usually a spot market for helicopters, that is. Then if the market does come back, do you have to hire back up or does this restructuring suggest higher structural margins going forward when things improve maybe next year or the year after?", "Scott Donnelly", "So look our intent you never like to go through this with the organization our intent here is that we would do this and that positions us to go through what we think is a fairly lean this year around that segment of the market and then well in the next year.", "And then of course we have things like 505 by 525, new things that are kicking in and look we've also taken some orders some of the 412s can be a bit of a spot market aircraft here there, but often there are also fleet buys right. So when you look at the Canadian deal for instance that's seven 412s.", "But those deliveries won\u2019t start until sometime next year into 2017. I think there is some other opportunities out there around 412s that are going to be similar. So there is customer activity going on and some of them are fleet buys but they\u2019re going to be from a timing perspective they will be out there.", "Now in terms of the ability to hire back, if we something on the production line obviously we know how to modulate their production line and those folks tend to be on recall and we can bring people back even if we need to do that to increase the production volumes. Clearly on the salary side we are trying to try to make it a restructuring of just how we organize and run the business.", "So that wouldn't necessarily be a volume related action later on. But certainly on the production side we have the ability to stay our production capacity up and down based on future volumes.", "Jon Raviv", "Great. Thanks. Then, just following up on cash deployment. How would you characterize your M&A appetite at this point given where things are and especially as a relatively sizeable potential helicopter asset could come to market?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would say that on - generally speaking on the M&A side, the way we think about it is more along the lines of a lot of the deals we\u2019ve done with TUG and ground support equipment, with our simulation businesses, with the Sherman and Reilly's, that sort of the general scope of what we look at transactions that are kind of in that size that are very complementary or bolt-on to our existing businesses.", "With respect to sort of the reference you're making in helicopter industry, I mean I think there is probably too much to say about that, I mean it\u2019s a process that\u2019s largely driven by that company who is been pretty public about type that they\u2019re doing something and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all see what they\u2019re going to do on their timeline, which I think they'll describe as being sometime mid-year.", "Jon Raviv", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ron Epstein", "Good morning guys. Scott, just maybe backing up on the end of that last question, it seems like there's potential to do all kinds of M&A going forward. I mean, there might be some other properties in the market, even one in Wichita. Can you just remind us broadly what your thinking is about doing M&A at this point given the asset base that you already have?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well Ron, we're quite open to M&A. I mean we\u2019ve done a fair bit of activity here over the last few years. We\u2019ve been generally speaking very happy with the results I mean they\u2019ve been very accretive to the company.", "We\u2019ve been happy with what they\u2019ve done in terms of strengthening us in the marketplace. And clearly that range is from the Beechcraft's or the world which for us is a very large deal.", "But we\u2019re really happy with how that\u2019s going both tactically and around cost and strategically where it positions the company going forward. And as I said we had a bunch of significantly smaller deals that we think have done really good things for our portfolio, they have helped to strengthen the businesses that we have, they have put us into some exciting new spaces that are very complementary like the simulation side of things, we strengthened our utility side of our Tool & Test business.", "The TUG stuff and ground support as I said earlier has gone really, really well. We think that\u2019s a great space for us to be in. And it\u2019s performed very well. So we\u2019re sort of open for business for that respect but there are things obviously that have to make a lot of sense for us, we\u2019re not just going out to try to do M&A for the sake of doing M&A, there have to be things that in our view fit with portfolio and the strategy of the company and as a result I mean things I think our investors would agree are the right places for us to deploy capital.", "Ron Epstein", "Sure. Maybe just following up on one of those, the Mechtronix acquisition in the sims space, I mean, how is that going? Are you picking up share? How could you -- if you can give us color around that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, it\u2019s going really well, we\u2019re very happy with it. The strength of that business so the foundation of it was more near transport side and as we said at the time we did the deals, we wanted to increase sort of our exposure in Aviation from just GA into the commercial civil aerospace side of things.", "We're really happy with it. We had some big strategic wins particularly with Boeing on the 737MAX and so we continue to execute well, I think on that contract and pick up more simulators as they progress down in their program, we have some other new platforms that we\u2019re investing in where we had some wins that haven\u2019t been announced particularly yet but I think we\u2019ll continue to help position us as a very serious player in the air transport market.", "And of course we\u2019re leveraging those assets to help things like the V-280 we talked about. One of the issues around the V-280 with our army customer is, do you have the maneuverability and the capability that they\u2019re used to today with the more conventional helicopter.", "And by taking the technology and the capability we have in the company now and very quickly going out and building a very realistic well modeled simulator, a lot of customers get in there and go out this thing, does perform like a conventional rotorcraft and also it\u2019s - I think it's helping us performing well tactically and strategically I think it\u2019s doing all the things that we hope that would do.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Robert Stallard", "To follow onto Ron's question, but from the other direction. It looks how we've seen a bit of M&A picking up in defense sector with people looking to put assets onto the market. I was wondering if you had any expressions of interest in some of your systems assets and what your criteria might be if you were looking to sell some things there?", "Scott Donnelly", "I guess I would say not we have not and whatever it might be or would be, we have to be something that we thought was in the best interest of our long-term shareholders and generate a lot of value.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay. Have you got any specific financial metrics, maybe, you might have in mind then?", "Scott Donnelly", "No.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay. Maybe on the aviation side, Scott, you mentioned the US market for Cessnas being pretty good. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some an idea of what end markets have been better or maybe worse? Have you seen any impact in the slowdown in energy, for example?", "Scott Donnelly", "I\u2019m sorry, slowdown in what Robert?", "Frank Connor", "Energy.", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I don\u2019t know how much color I give you on that. It\u2019s been pretty broad based obviously our citation customer base is for the most part small to mid-size businesses, lot's of privately held companies and it's pretty well across that whole normal spectrum of our kind of customers.", "And we always see rotations in the industry, whether energy is doing something real estate right now is pretty strong, construction these are \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty broad base of industries. And I don\u2019t know that I can really give you any color specifically this quarter as to which ones are more active than others.", "Robert Stallard", "What about maybe on the charts or the fractional side, has there been any improvement there?", "Scott Donnelly", "We haven't had a fractional aircraft sale in the seven years I\u2019ve been here. So, yes it\u2019s been since 2008, so there\u2019s - in terms of new aircraft into a fractional obviously some of our current fractional customers are selling aircraft as they roll-off the deals for previous customers. So there\u2019s an aftermarket out there, but there\u2019s nothing new that we\u2019re selling into fractional right now.", "We have had a fair bit of closed charter operation obviously goes up has been a big customer, King Air has put some used XLSs into it but that's probably the some total what I see going on - in terms of our sales directly into the fractional charter market.", "Now we hope to see that change obviously. The NetJet guys has selected a Latitude is their mid-sized platform and with that product now getting the certification there\u2019s an awful lot of activity between ourselves and NetJets on how we help market and take that product into the fractional market.", "So I think we have some significant upside in terms of fractional NetJet is obviously is a very powerful player in that in market and the fact that they chose Latitude is their mid-sized platform, I think it will be big boost to us.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Levenson from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Steve Levenson", "Thanks good morning everybody. Could you give us an update, please, on Scorpion and maybe a little bit more on international interest for that plane as well as V-22?", "Scott Donnelly", "First the Scorpion program is progressing very, very well. We got a ton of flight hours, it's been a very busy test and demonstration program. The aircraft is performing extremely well. As I think we mentioned before, there\u2019s a couple of things as we went through the test program that we felt would modify when we went into full-grade production.", "So we had an engineering team that's been incorporating all those changes. And we\u2019re getting to ready to undertake build of what would be the conforming aircraft ready to go into certification testing in production.", "So in terms of the technical side of the program, I\u2019d say it\u2019s going very well. In terms of the business developments side we have a number of customers that are ongoing conversations around the aircraft and have seen the aircraft and there's sort of what I would call a normal business development activity.", "Those processes tend to take a while, because as you can imagine they are government sales and so budgeting and evaluation and what not is a - they take their normal course but there's number of conversations going on.", "In terms of things like V-22, we\u2019ve seen the Japanese deal has been announced, it\u2019s been budgeted. There is detailed negotiations and we're hopeful that sometime this summer that will actually be under contract. They\u2019ve already budgeted I think the first five aircraft though the total I believe 19 is they are talking about.", "So I think that program is progressing well. There is a number of other customers to which there are active discussions underway. So I think combined with the COD announcement, and as well as those activities I think we got a very, very strong future on V-22.", "At the time the only issue for us is just the timing of getting these things through the - getting them on the contract and getting them into the production process. So the \u2013 the unfortunate side is it's probably not a material impact to us until the late teens as opposed ", "to some would help us out next year just given how long it takes to get them under contract and get it going.", "Steve Levenson", "Got it. Thank you very much for the color.", "Doug Wilburne", "Dan I think that we're little bit over time here, so we\u2019ll take one last call here that\u2019s still in queue and then call it a day.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our last question for today comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Justin Bergner", "My one question which remains after all the other questions have been answered is with respect to Bell and commercial mix, will that weigh on margins even after the cost reductions that are being taken are completed? Or do you expect you'll be able to offset the mix headwinds as well?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would say that on the \u2013 as you look through the course of the year, again what's typical for us is that we\u2019ll see not only overall higher volume through the balance of the year but we\u2019ll see a higher mix of 412s as we move through the year. And that\u2019s what really drives that quarterly progression of margins late through the balance of the year.", "And that would be true across all of our platforms frankly, as you look at the cost savings associated with the restructuring that we\u2019re doing, that really manifest itself in overall manufacturing rates and overhead rates and so the cost and/or benefits associated with that are spread across all of our commercial and military product lines.", "So the underlying mix and volume which will increase the course of the year is really what drives that incremental margin rate.", "Justin Bergner", "Okay. But you don't expect an ongoing mix headwinds as we look out to next year and the following years?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, not at this time, I would expect it will just see our normal progression where we have higher volumes for 412 through the balance of the year.", "Justin Bergner", "Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Great. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10 am Eastern time today until July 27, 2015 at midnight.

(Broker)", "Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for standing by and welcome to the Textron Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead, sir.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, down 7.3% from $3.4 billion in last year's third quarter. However, income from continuing operations was $0.63 per share, up 10.5% from $0.57 per share in the third quarter of 2014. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $16 million was $116 million compared to $144 million in last year's third quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody.", "Revenues were up at Textron Aviation, Systems and Industrial but down at Bell, which led to an overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Segment profit was up 6.5%, reflecting improved margin results in each of our business segments.", "At Bell, the decline in revenues was primarily due to lower deliveries in our V-22 program, as we delivered four V-22s, down from 12 a year ago. This decline was partially offset by an increase in H-1 deliveries, as we delivered five units this year compared to four in last year's third quarter.", "On the commercial side, shipments were also up, with 45 aircraft delivered in the quarter compared to 41 a year ago. While commercial helicopter markets remain challenging, Bell continues to show a favorable win rate, so we still believe the commercial deliveries will be up modestly this year.", "On the new product front, we've completed over 45 hours of ground testing and 35 hours of flight testing on our 525 Relentless program since the program's first flight on July 1. During that time, we've successfully conducted numerous tests, including ground resonance testing, gross weight and envelope expansion, maximum continuous power climbs, minimum power descents and initial autorotation testing. We've also successfully engaged a full fly-by-wire system to a speed of 150 knots and an altitude of 13,000 feet.", "Overall, the aircraft has performed very well, proving to be a very stable platform that is meeting or exceeding all of our initial performance expectations. We've completed structural assembly of our second 525 test aircraft and expect it to enter the flight test program by the end of the year, with a third test aircraft expected to follow close behind. We are currently targeting certification and first delivery of the 525 during the first half of 2017.", "Our 505 Jet Ranger X program is also making good progress, as we've now accumulated over 470 flight test hours. We are targeting certification and entry into service during the first half of next year.", "We also continue to have success on both the U.S. and foreign military front at Bell. As discussed during our last earnings call, we received our first international order for V-22s in July with the signing of a contract with Japan to deliver the first five of 17 expected total units.", "On the H-1 front, we were awarded a DoD contract in August for an additional 35 H-1 units, consisting of 32 aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps and the first three of 12 planned deliveries for Pakistan. Based on the existing U.S. Marine and Pakistan requirements, we expect a gradual increase in H-1 deliveries from the mid-20 this year to the mid-30s in 2017 and 2018.", "Moving to Systems, both revenues and margins were up, reflecting higher weapons and unmanned systems deliveries. At Marine & Land Systems last month, we were awarded a contract to supply 55 COMMANDO Select armored vehicles to the Afghan National Army. We expect to deliver most of those units during the fourth quarter, and we're pursuing a number of other promising foreign military opportunities for our COMMANDO line.", "Elsewhere at TMLS, we continue to make good progress on the Ship-to-Shore development program, with the first two landing aircraft now in production. The initial craft remains on track for delivery in 2017.", "Moving to Industrial, we achieved a 5.5% increase in revenue after a 7.5% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in each of our businesses. Kautex had the highest increase in revenue with volumes up in Europe, North America and Asia. Textron Specialized Vehicles also had solid growth across all business lines, reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions. At Jacobsen, we launched our new Professional Series commercial grade lineup of mowers and utility vehicles aimed at the North American missile market at last week's GIE+EXPO industry show in Louisville, Kentucky.", "Overall, our Industrial segment is performing well, both on the top line and in terms of cost productivity in what has otherwise been a difficult industrial environment.", "Wrapping up with Textron Aviation, we delivered 37 jets and 29 King Airs compared to 33 jets and 30 King Airs last year. Margins in the Aviation segment improved significantly on the higher revenues and improved performance, which included lower amortization related to fair value step-up adjustments.", "Our strategy of investing in new products continues to pay off, as we delivered our first four Latitudes in the quarter. We expect to see a ramp of Latitude deliveries, reflecting both retail demand and deliveries to NetJets. The Latitude opens the door to our new generation of larger cabin Citations, including the new Longitude, which will make its public debut next month at the annual NBAA show. We believe the Longitude will be a significant game changer in the business jet world when we reveal its superior performance, design characteristics and best-in-class operating cost. We will have a broad array of Citation and King Air products on display, as well as product-related developments to share. So we expect NBAA to be a positive catalyst for Textron Aviation as we look to 2016 and beyond.", "To sum up the third quarter, good margin results across our businesses contributed to a solid overall financial performance. With only a quarter to go, we're adjusting our full-year guidance for earnings by bringing up the bottom of the range by $0.10 and maintaining our outlook for cash flow.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone.", "Segment profit in the quarter was $312 million, up $19 million from the third quarter of 2014 on a $250 million decrease in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.", "Revenues were up $79 million from this period last year, reflecting higher jet and military deliveries. Aviation had a profit of $107 million compared to $62 million a year ago. This increase reflected the higher volumes, as well as improved performance, which included a lower amortization of $9 million related to fair value step-up adjustments. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, approximately flat with the end of the second quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $426 million, reflecting lower V-22 deliveries and lower commercial revenues largely related to lower aftermarket volume and a change in the mix of commercial aircraft. Segment profit decreased $47 million from the third quarter of 2014, reflecting the lower volumes partially offset by favorable performance largely related to our cost-reduction activities.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $62 million primarily due to higher weapons and sensors and unmanned systems volumes. Segment profit was up $12 million, reflecting the impact of the higher volumes.", "Industrial revenues increased $43 million due to higher overall volumes partially offset by $59 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $8 million, reflecting the impact of the higher volumes.", "Finance segment revenues decreased $8 million and profit increased $1 million.", "Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $27 million, down sequentially from the second quarter, primarily from the impact of lower ending share price. Our tax rate in the quarter was 30.2%. Interest expense was $33 million, down $4 million from last year.", "During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million of our shares at an overall cost of about $124 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 5 million of our shares at an overall cost of about $211 million.", "To wrap up with guidance, we are estimating full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.50 a share and cash flow from continuing operations of the Manufacturing Group before pension contributions of $550 million to $650 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Brad, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "All right, thank you. And our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much. Good morning.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Scott, maybe we'll start off with Aviation. There's been some concern about emerging market weakness in business jet and FAA flight data still being fairly static. I was wondering if you can give us your perspective on what you're seeing out there in terms of customer demand and maybe pricing.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think, Robert, the market in North America, the U.S, has been reasonably strong. I think we're pretty happy with the market in the U.S. There's no question that the markets in Europe and Asia are challenged. I think part of that is just the economies are in a pretty difficult spot and, of course, the U.S. dollar being quite strong puts some additional pressure on that in terms of all the product lines. So there's no question right now our recovery and the strength of the business is largely North American.", "In terms of pricing, it mixes by model but, overall, the impact of pricing has been not really material on a quarter-to-quarter basis.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. And then maybe secondly, on Bell, a very good margin performance in the quarter. You think this is sustainable going forward?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Robert, we've been trying to target the business in that 11% to 12% range. Obviously, we took a lot of cost actions earlier this year when we realized the commercial market would be lighter than we expected, so I think we're comfortable with our guidance this year on that 11% to 12% range based on those actions. I think there's always risk on the volume line, I think, but I think we're in a spot right now where we feel pretty good about that 11%, 12% guidance.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And just a quick follow-up on that. The V-22 -- it seems to be a bit volatile from quarter to quarter, is it?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean, it's obviously been stepping down through the year, Robert, on the new contract but, frankly, this quarter was probably a little lighter than it normally would be just in terms of some of the timing of completions of aircraft and acceptances. So it's probably more volatile this quarter than it would normally be. We would have actually planned probably six aircraft sell, there were a couple aircraft that sold right at the very beginning of the next quarter so they just missed the revenue in this quarter.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thank you. I just wondered on the Latitude, when we're thinking about the effect of that on Aviation margins from here, as you see deliveries ramp up, do you think there'll be a big negative margin hit, or you can kind of manage it across the fixed cost base?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we'll manage it within the context of the overall business. So the margin rates, the costs have come in about where we expected on the product. We will as we go into next year in particular because we'll have a number of deliveries into NetJets which typically are a level below our typical retail sales since they are effectively a reseller of those aircraft in a fractional sense. We'll have some lower margin deals in there, but I think it's something we'll be able to manage in the context of the overall business.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. And then on Bell, you talked about commercial deliveries still be up potentially. Maybe just home in on 412s. I think you've delivered nine to-date after 26 in the whole of last year. How are the orders trending there and how do you think about those deliveries looking out?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there's a fair bit of activity in both late this year and through next year. I think certainly we'll be down in terms of the total number of 412s for the year, but that's kind of what we've been expecting as we've been going through all of our restructuring and production planning.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. And lastly, buyback, a step up to a degree in Q3 as you'd mentioned. Is that just kind of opportunistic around the share price, or is there anything more fundamental there?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think it's consistent with what we've been saying, so we'll continue to retire the \u2013 to make sure we're not diluting, and opportunistically we do some additional share buyback and we certainly had some of that activity in the quarter.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes. What I wanted to ask on the guidance for the year, and this is probably more for Frank. If you look at the high end, Frank, it implies $0.81 in the first quarter. You did $0.76 last year but you had $13 million in special charges, $8 million of beat step-up, interest expense probably $7 million lower, so I net that out as a benefit to this year of $0.07 a share. So if I put it together, you're actually forecasting a couple cents below last year. I figured Bell's going to be down, but Aviation ought to be up by more than what Bell's down and the other sectors probably not much to split. So I just wondering what's wrong with the arithmetic, or are you just kind of being on the conservative side for the guidance?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, look, I think obviously we've talked a lot about we've got a difficult environment for Bell. We've got kind of we've done a lot on the cost side. But kind of as volumes have come down there, that puts kind of pressure on just the cost structure and cost base at Bell. So, no, I don't \u2013 I think we're being appropriate given the market environment that we're seeing out there and, obviously, we're working hard to achieve those results.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And one for Scott. Latitude deliveries, four in the quarter, Scott, I mean, I would have thought maybe there's a little bit more. I mean, is this just timing and could you give us a kind of a ballpark as to what we might see in the fourth quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it is largely timing, George. We've got the first four aircraft, we've got the certification done obviously and got the first four aircraft out there into the market. We certainly expect to see that ramp as we go through the fourth quarter.", "Aircraft is still doing great with customers. I think it's showing very well. We'll have it obviously at NBAA. It's been doing a lot of flying in both the U.S. and Europe. We expect to get the OSIS certification here in the quarter as well, probably late in the quarter going through that process which could have some effect on where we land in terms of total deliveries, but we still feel great about the aircraft. It's flying great. The customers seem to love it, and as I said, we expect to see that ramp as we go through the fourth quarter and obviously into 2016.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "You don't want to put a number on it, though?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I probably wouldn't put a number on a particular model, number of deliveries in a quarter, no.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much. Good execution.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks, George.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Sheila.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "It looks like we'll see the Longitude at NBAA. Could you maybe just give us an idea how you're thinking about the magnitude of the investment in Cessna overall and further refining the portfolio?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, the investment kind of continues obviously at Cessna. I don't know if the fixed wing aviation has ever had more programs going on at the same time than we have right now but, obviously, the Longitude has been a significant investment and one that we'll continue to make. We're holding our late 2017 entry into service on the aircraft. I think it's going to show beautifully at NBAA. And we'll have some additional announcements, frankly, beyond that in terms of what we're doing with the product portfolio.", "So the pace of the investment I certainly expect will continue. We tend not to give a specific number for each of the aircraft or anything, but the R&D is continuing as we've committed and I think that's paying off for us. You've seen what's happened over the last couple years with a lot of the upgrades, the Latitude, obviously, we're very happy with. Longitude, we talk in terms of our single engine turboprop as well as what we're doing to continue to expand our jet portfolio.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thank you. And then just a follow-up on Bell margins. As we look out on the commercial side, how do we think about the impact of the 505 and the 525?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sheila, the 505, given where that part of the market is, is usually dilutive to margin rates. Those aircraft tend to be at a pretty low price point, so there's not a whole lot of margin dollars in them. It tends to make up for that as you look long term in the service business. We still have a huge portion of our service business today at Bell that's driven by jet rangers and 206s, 407, the light single end of the market. But it won't have a material impact in the margin rate.", "And, of course, the 525 we expect will certainly be a profitable product, as those tend to be in the larger end, are more profitable in the initial sale. But again, that's something we're talking about entering the service in the latter half of 2017, so it wouldn't affect anything that we would talk about when we get into 2016.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. So overall, the commercial business is net neutral to profitability next year. There's no significant impact from the 505 or certification on the 525s?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, there shouldn't be. I mean, the number of 505s in the year next year I don't think will create a material impact in terms of the margin rate.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you very much. So it looks like both the 412 and the 429 kind of are running light and the smaller helicopters are doing well. What does that imply for Bell revenues for the year? Can you still get \u2013 can you get to $3.5 billion and kind of a flattish fourth quarter in terms of revenues?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Cai, I mean \u2013 it's a good question. If there's any risk to where we're going, it's in that volume and then particularly on the commercial side of the business. But you're right, the volumes have been stronger in the lights than they have been in the light twins or the heavier twins in the 412 side. But I think we're going to be close to the revenue guidance numbers that we've given you guys. There's probably $100 million of risk in it or something like that, but that's \u2013 for the total year, that's probably where we're going to head in terms of the Bell revenue.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, given kind of the ambitious new product kind of plan you've got, as I recall, last year you did about $565 million in R&D and I think you were kind of talking about $600 million for this year. What can you get \u2013 can you update us where is the R&D for this year and how should we think about it going forward?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think we're going to continue to see increases. And so, in the third quarter, we were up slightly in terms of overall R&D spending for the total company. And I think that's a trend that will continue, Cai, and that's largely driven by the investments that we've made in the Latitude, what we're doing in the Longitude and other stuff we'll talk at NBAA in terms of our fixed wing aviation business. And obviously, we're getting close on certification here of the 505, but we have the 525 now in full certification testing, we have a huge investment in the V-280 program and, obviously, a lot of investments across our Industrial and Systems businesses as well. So I think the level of R&D is tracking with kind of what we told you guys to expect.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Well, I think everyone expects the R&D will go up and the revenues generally also are going up. Should we think of the R&D to sales holding approximately flat or is it likely to be up with this ambitious Longitude program?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think it's probably flattish, Cai. Obviously, this year we've had some additional headwind in total, but that's largely driven by the fact that we've been seeing this contraction at Bell, principally on the military side, to some degree on the commercial side. But I think our expectations going forward is that it will hold about flattish in terms of percent of sales.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering if I could ask a quick question about Kautex and the exposure to Volkswagen that you have there and whether you expect to see any impact from what's going on there.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's very hard to say at this point. VW's obviously an important customer for us, but we're a supplier to the industry in total. At this point, I think it's hard to predict exactly how that's all going to play out. Clearly here in the near term, we've seen a movement from a lot of the small diesel to the petro-based models just because of the situation with sales in that product line.", "But I'd say at this point, it's too early to know what's going to happen, how customers are going to react and do they choose other VW models, do they choose models from other manufacturers. I think it's very much still to be determined. And so for us, it becomes a model mix question, both within VW or outside of VW. And at this point, we just don't have a whole lot of data as an industry on what that shift is going to look like. But I, frankly, don't expect it to be a material impact to us one way or the other. The automotive markets have been fairly strong, and I would expect to see them kind of continue on the trajectory. This is really just a question of model mix.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Would you be able to size your \u2013 the percentage of Kautex revenue that comes from VW?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, we wouldn't \u2013 I don't think we would ever publish those numbers. As I say, they're a significant customer, but across a very, very broad range of VW product. And that's why the question in terms of what the mix does, I think a lot of the mix shift, frankly, will be within VW, so it's...", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Scott, if I'm thinking about scenarios for Cessna production in 2016, is a production decline in the scenario analysis or is that off the table, and could you answer that both including and excluding the Latitude?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I won't do it including or excluding certain model types. I would say, Noah, and we want to \u2013 we're not probably ready to get into 2016 guidance just yet, but, clearly, as we have production running today, no, I would not expect to see a decline in volume across any of our product lines.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Jet turboprop single-engine, I think where we're tracking right now in the market, I think we're still running production with expectations that we'll not see declines next year.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And on the margins at Aviation, the incremental both sequentially and year-over-year, stripping out the inventory step-up looks quite nicely ahead of how you guys talk about how that should trend over the long run. Can you parse out what drove the upside in the quarter and how that should trend over the next few quarters?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Noah, it's always \u2013 when we talk about incrementals, it's sort of how to think long term. We kind of talk about this 20% or so kind of number. Obviously, that's a little bit lumpy. We're going to have quarters where we do quite a bit higher than that. This is a good example of such a quarter. But we're going to have quarters where it's going to trend below that. And it largely has to do with how R&D costs are coming in, SG&A shows \u2013 I mean, there's always noise in that number. So I think the guys did a great job of converting on the volume that came through this quarter and it's a very solid performance, so I still think that kind of 20% numbers on an incremental basis are good numbers to use, but there is going to be lumpiness to that.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then just one last one. In Bell commercial, has the oil and gas customer at least stopped getting worse, or is it hard to tell? And where will you exit the year with that customer as a percentage of Bell revenue versus where it started the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Noah, I honestly don't have that number. I think we've talked before about the oil and gas segment historically being sort of around that 10%-15% kind of a percent of our sales directly into that oil and gas market. I think our visibility, obviously, that's down this year, so you're not seeing a whole lot of new equipment sales. Utilization is clearly down in those markets, so that's impacting our aftermarket, obviously. I can't tell you that I see the data on enough of a daily basis to say, hey, has it flattened? Is it moving around? I don't really know. I think the trend of utilization being down continues. And in terms of what that means, I don't have the exact number this year to compare it to tell you last year and what that stabilized.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I know that's not much of an answer. Unfortunately, that's one bit of data I don't have, so...", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "It sounds like, I mean, without \u2013 so you don't have the data, but it also sounds like it is not clear that it has actually stopped getting worse, necessarily.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I don't \u2013 I certainly have not anecdotally had any feedback or input from the guys saying, hey, good news as the oil and gas guys are starting to fly more or back looking for new aircraft.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. Okay. Thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 I know you're going to show more on the Longitude, but there were discussions last week about delays on the whole Silvercrest engine line, and can you just talk about how that's impacting the timeline for that plane?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I mean, I want to sort of stop short of doing product announcements at this point, but I would say that we're certainly aware of what's going on with the Silvercrest. That does not have an impact in terms of the Longitude and its launch date in late 2017. There's a lot of work that's been going on in terms of our portfolio in the jets business, particularly the higher end of our jet business, and I think it will all start to make more sense once you see what happens at NBAA. So we'll talk about our whole product line and portfolio and what's going on there in the large cabin segment for us, and I think it will all make sense in the fact that we have a clear line of sight to Longitude in 2017 and the product portfolio beyond that.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just to go back, can you talk a little bit about some of the demand in the non-jet programs? Just because we saw both Collins and Garmin talk about some weakness, it seems like that would imply King Airs and some of the Beech products might be having some pressure. Can you just talk about some of the demand in that area?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So if you look at the King Air, the numbers we give you guys, we had 29 in the quarter versus 30 a year ago. We've been a few aircraft lighter in each of the previous quarters as well, so the volume would be down, but only a couple, two, three aircraft on a year-over-year basis. So the King Air, I think, is continuing to do fine.", "Caravan deliveries will be, in my view, roughly, probably flat on a year-over-year basis. We've had a little bit of softness in China. We've had some good-sized orders in China as well, so Caravans will be kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis. And, frankly, I think we'll be up and we're already up on a year-over-year basis in our piston product line, which are all Garmin as well. So I think if you looked at our year-to-date performance in aircraft at our Garmin base relative to their comments (31:27) marketplace, we're actually up and expect to be up for the total year.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And one last question is can you just talk a little bit about the Canadian TAPV program? I know it's somewhat unrelated, but the election seems like it might have some impact on what Canada does in the aircraft programs. Has there been anything that would affect the demand or the timing or schedule for TAPV at this point?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Nothing political, certainly. I mean, we've had no indications that there's any change in their strategy with respect to this program. We are in the test phase of the program. And as we talked, this is kind of a race to the end of the fourth quarter, whether we get deliveries this year or we get them in the next year. So the test program continues. Guys are working it. But in terms of any jeopardy or risk from the change politically, we're certainly not aware of any.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "But now sitting at the end of October, you haven't really started the delivery ramp yet in the fourth quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. No, that's correct.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So quick question, I guess, for Frank. What's going on with the balance sheet? Inventories are up $600 million in the quarter, and it just seems like the balance sheet's getting a little bloated. And just curious what's going on?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, so we've had \u2013 we've seen a little bit of inventory build. Obviously, we're very seasonal in terms of kind of what happens with inventories. We had planned the year a little stronger at Bell commercial and we've seen kind of less volume there, as we've indicated, than we would have thought, and the year has been a little bit more backend-loaded than we would have thought. So kind of nothing that is troubling in any perspective, but it is kind of something that we continue to watch. We, obviously, also have been building inventory as we've ramped the Latitude program, and so kind of just in terms of how those kind of the Latitude program will grow from a volume standpoint, we need to begin to flow that inventory through the system. So that has a bit of an impact as well.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Do you have any white tail helicopters sitting in inventory?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We don't talk about kind of white tails in any of this, right? We have production plans. We have delivery forecasts and we try and match those up as best we can. And on the helicopter side, kind of unlike the jet side, you also have long completion activity at times. So kind of how long it takes from kind of beginning to fabricate to actually delivering a helicopter can vary dramatically, depending on the configuration of that helicopter. So there's a fair amount of volatility to that.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Keep in mind we took our production cut in the second quarter of this year. It's now just the third quarter, so it takes some time to catch up with that flow through the...", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think what Doug said, Ron, is when we start these things down the line, we're not going to stop them, so we did cut production schedules. But for the stuff that was in the pipeline, obviously, we can continue that stuff and build it out.", "In terms of the white tail, remember, there's nobody \u2013 you have to flow production, right? So there are certainly orders for all those models of aircraft that go out into 2016. The question's going to be whether \u2013 how many of those you do get completed and finished and able to deliver in 2015, but any that are not are already spoken for in orders that you look at in 2016. So there's not aircraft that we don't know what's ever going to happen to that aircraft.", "But we were running production lines at a higher pace, we cut that back in the second quarter. We are going to finish \u2013 go through the final assembly up to the green stage of an aircraft. And then in the helicopter market, the level of customization usually is pretty significant, so those things will then go into the completion process prior to delivery. They're not sitting on a ramp, typically, in a deliverable form.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I ought to mention, we had a couple V-22s that delivered a week later. So had we measured the balance sheet a week later, it would have had a significant improvement. So it's mostly timing, Ron.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, okay. Fair enough. And then just completely changing gears, what's going on in the golf cart market? How are you guys doing with share and are you seeing any pickup there? Your primary competitor in that market said they've seen some growth in that market. Just curious about what's going on. Nobody ever talks about golf carts.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We talk about golf carts all the time, you guys just never ask about them. No, our golf business is doing great. I'm really happy with it. Our product lineup is in good shape. We've had some nice additions to the family this year in terms of some of the \u2013 more on the utility side of the product line in addition to just the basic golf cart. And the business is doing really well.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So are you seeing growth, do you think?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We certainly see some growth, sure.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Cool. Thanks, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gents. Just a couple of follow-ups, I guess, covered a lot of ground here. Just back to Cessna margins, I mean, to one of the earlier questions, sequentially, they were actually quite strong and, Scott, you kind of just suggested that's kind of the normal lumpiness and everything going on in the business. But given that lumpiness and our inability to kind of forecast that sort of thing, can you triangulate us a little bit on actually what you're expecting for Cessna margins in the fourth quarter as part of this guidance construct?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Probably not, Jeff. I mean, look, this is why we do the annual guidance because we do get lumps through the quarters in all of our businesses, right? So I think the margin performance \u2013 look, we're not going to be able to sustain 40%-plus incrementals on volume, obviously, so I think we will expect to see a considerably lower margin conversion on what growth there is in the fourth quarter.", "But we'll be probably \u2013 look, I think we'll end up a little bit north of our yearly guidance range that we gave you back in the beginning of the year. The performance in the business has been quite good in items of its conversion, so I think the \u2013 frankly, compared to the annual guidance number we gave you, we're likely to be light on the revenue side. We've been sort of struggling through that all year. I mean, I think we're doing okay. As I said, I think the U.S. market, the North American market is good. The international markets have been tougher probably than we expected, which means we're, probably from an overall annual guidance, going to be lower on revenue but probably up a little bit in terms of the margin rate from the full year range.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. And then just on Latitude, has there been any meaningful change in order intake on that aircraft now that it's flying and available? Can you provide any color there and any impact that it may have had on other products in the product line?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, we're selling them which is good, right? So I think it's been well-received in the marketplace. So we are booking orders. And we've always \u2013 look, there could be some cannibalization within the family, obviously, as you add more products, but we're also up a little bit on Sovereign sales in the quarter as well. So the Sovereign Plus continues to sell as well. Really, those two aircraft are similar, but it's a question whether you want a larger cabin and give up a little bit of range, and single club plus two or you want to go with the big double club and a little bit more range on the Sovereign side. So both aircraft right now are doing well in the market.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "All right. And then just one last one for Frank. It's the time of the year to be thinking about pensions again. Can you give us any color, Frank, on kind of snap the line today on the various metrics, what we might expect in the next year on headwinds or cash funding?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Jeff, as I always say, there's still a lot of moving pieces. But I think from a cash funding standpoint, we don't expect kind of a need to make any contributions into the defined benefit plan, sort of our defined contribution plan sort of be similar to this year's levels.", "And from an expense standpoint, a lot of moving parts will not be a headwind unless something were to change dramatically and should be a little bit of a tailwind and, again, it depends on where things come out in terms of returns and discount rates and stuff like that.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. I think last quarter at Cessna, the aftermarket was a shade lower year-on-year. I'm just curious, can you give us some spot on the Aviation aftermarket trends as well as the Bell aftermarket trends?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Look, I think the fixed wing aviation market this year on the aftermarket is going to be pretty flattish. And I think that just reflects sort of utilization, what utilization numbers that we see in the U.S. around takeoff cycles and such is up a little bit. I think the data is not as good internationally, but it feels like it's probably down a little bit. So kind of netting out the two, I think ex-the incrementals obviously that we're going to see from the first quarter numbers of the additional Beech and (41:25) aftermarket, I think the overall organic number is going to be pretty flattish. On the Bell side, it's going to be down and that's just, I think, not to be unexpected given what's going on in utilization in the helicopter business.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "In the Bell side, is that a deceleration or is that kind of consistent quarter-on-quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Quarter-on-quarter.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I'm just curious if you're seeing aftermarket deterioration.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It was a little stronger in the beginning of the year.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And the only other follow-up for me was on cash flow. So just for the year, and I guess following up on Ron's question, it looks like you'd be probably at the lower end of the range for this year, maybe given kind of performance year-to-date, but maybe in 2016 given the inventory build, you might have a cleaner trajectory to have a little bit better cash conversions. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it's all dependent on how volume plays out here in the balance of the year, right? I mean, you get down to the end of the year, every dollar of revenue translates into a dollar of cash. But I think the way you've categorized it, obviously, we think if things go the way we'd like to see them go, we'll be in fine shape in terms of the cash guidance number that we've given you. Obviously, I think this rolls over into 2016, but our current plans would have us solidly in the guidance that we've given you.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Yeah, good morning, guys. I just had a question about the TRU simulator business, just because you guys have called out the 737 MAX opportunity as being fairly sizeable, and I'm just wondering when the first simulator delivery would be and kind of how fast the ramp is.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, the initial \u2013 the contract that we talked about before is with Boeing to provide their 737 MAX for their flight test programs and their training centers. They've already exercised the first few incremental units to go into their training centers, and there's a number of options left to be exercised on that.", "I think beyond that the ramp is really going to be driven by individual airlines, as they get closer to taking deliveries of their 737 MAXes, so that's probably still a ways downstream just given the schedule of the 737 MAX coming into the market.", "But the development program, which is what it is at this stage of the game working with Boeing to bring that to the market, is going very well. I think we're happy with how the product's coming along and have a lot of engagement with them and are in the process of assembling and building that first unit for their use.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Scott, (44:11) thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, good morning, everyone. Frank, can you talk a little bit about Systems backlog and what you expect seasonally as we move into the fourth quarter and how quickly you'd expect the backlog that you have there to convert into revenues?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Oh, there's so many pieces to a Systems backlog and it's lumpy. So, no, I don't know that I can give you great guidance in terms of kind of how that backlog rolls out.", "I think we feel good about our kind of sold position, if you will, for Systems for kind of near-term revenue realization, so Systems is a lot more about execution. Obviously, we need to continue to take orders and execute on foreign military sales and all the things that we've talked about on the Systems side, but that backlog does provide a path towards near-term revenue performance as long as we execute on those programs.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay; great. And then you talked a little bit about the H-1 ramp. Can you talk about the impact on margins in the out years as the H-1 ramps?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it's only goodness for us, right? I mean, it's a very solid program, the incremental volume which we've just received that order which includes the next lots of the Marine Corps, as well as starting now the Pakistan deal. So those incrementals, as we \u2013 they'll probably have a little bit of benefit in 2016 as we start \u2013 stuff goes into the production cycle, obviously, but the revenue recognition and margin deliveries will be 2017 and 2018, but certainly any additional volume is good for us incrementally. So probably not a material impact in 2016 but beneficial to us in 2017, 2018 as we see that increased number of deliveries. You add six to 10 H-1s a year, that's good business.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Right. Okay, great. And then, Scott, what do you think the earliest timeframe is for volume increase in the V-22s, given the international demand that's come in?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's probably pretty similar actually. We now have the options that have been exercised to support the first five for Japan, and it's a similar kind of story, right? We'll start -- the long lead activity in production will start to ramp a little bit in 2016, but those deliveries technically are slated to 2018. I think there's possibility that we can try to get a couple of those pulled back to 2017, but we'll have to work on the customer as we go forward but \u2013 so not a lot of impact in 2016; beneficial certainly in 2017 and 2018.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then last one. Frank, what are you assuming for corporate expenses end of (47:19) year, end of the fourth quarter that's baked into your guidance?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, we had been in the $175 million from a guidance standpoint. It should be lighter than that. Some of that is share price performance year-to-date. But we've got pretty good cost control going on, so we'll be less than that $175 million number.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Johnny Wright with Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. So just sticking on the V-22 and the H-1 kind of the international side, how do you kind of size the opportunity there from an order perspective in terms of where are you looking at, where's the best opportunities on the H-1 and the V-22 and how should we expect that to play out over the next few years?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, look, we always struggle with predicting foreign military sales. And there's a number of customers that are, I would say, in active discussions on both V-22 and H-1. The difficulty on these things is just the timing of how long does it take to come to closure on. And I think it took a lot longer, frankly, than we would have expected on V-22 for the first deal to come in, but it did come in which is good, so I think that generates some momentum for us. We are in discussions. We collectively, ourselves and the U.S. government, with several other V-22 potential customers and several H-1 customers as well.", "And so I've only been wrong 100% of the time when it comes to trying to predict the timing from those deals transitioning from discussions to under contract. So I would say I have a high degree of confidence that they will come to contract. The timing is hard to predict.", "Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Okay, well, appropriate. I have another question for you --", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's probably not a very fulfilling answer but, look, it's the reality. FMS deals are just difficult to come all the way to closure.", "Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Well, this is going to be appropriate then. So, Scorpion -- where are we at from an FMS standpoint? How do you kind of see the demand playing out there and, timing-wise, where do you think it's most likely to fall now in terms of first order?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the criticality for us on Scorpion right now is really around certification. The aircraft has been seen and flown by a lot of prospective customers. They're very excited about the aircraft. They love the performance. They love the price point. We need to get a certification program going. I think we're very close to doing that.", "Obviously from our internal perspective, the production of the conforming aircraft to go into flight test cert is coming along very well. We expect that conforming aircraft to be flying in probably the first into the second quarter next year.", "And I think that as a result of a lot of work over the past year, we are getting pretty close to having a clean path to an airworthiness certification, which is critical to be able to close deals with customers. I think there's a lot of interest. But the certification box is one we need to be able to check, so we're doing everything we need to do to take care of all the design and manufacturing side of it, and I think here pretty shortly we'll have a clear path to be able to talk to customers about the certification process, which is going to be good and critical to closing on first orders.", "Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "So is it fair to assume something like second half 2016 first order, so shipment in 2017 maybe, is that a best-case assumption?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Something along those timelines, that's...", "Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead, sir.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Good morning, Scott. Good morning, Frank.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Justin.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Most of my questions have been answered. I was going to ask in regards to Textron Aviation margins, is there anything in the 2015 margin performance that will stand out as a positive that creates headwinds as we look into sort of the potential for 2016 Aviation margins?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think so. There's no unusual or no onetime kind of stuff in there. I mean, that's \u2013 as reported, it's pretty clean.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Okay, great. And second question, as you sort of move on from \u2013 or I guess as the Sikorsky deal moves toward completion and as you hopefully work down your inventory and have a lighter balance sheet, have free cash flow priorities changed at all in the organization or perhaps just give us an update as to where they stand today?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It's exactly the same which is, obviously, we're continuing to invest heavily back into organic growth of the business, but kind of that's not a \u2013 necessarily flows through the cash flow statement item, but it's to focus on some of our free cash flow and acquisitions to the extent available and we continue to do that. And then otherwise to the extent there's excess cash, to return that through opportunistic share repurchase activities. So it all remains the same level of priorities.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yeah, just a couple of follow-ups. Could you give us, Scott, what percent of the orders in the quarter were from North America in Aviation?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Aviation, it's roughly around 80%/20% right now, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And the percentage of commercial helicopters that you see to the oil and service business?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Quite low.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's what we were saying earlier, George, we don't really have good data on that. It's kind of hard, for one thing, sometimes you sell a helicopter to a utility operator and what the end use of that is sometimes a little difficult to discern.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we have \u2013 I mean, we have a number of \u2013 there's a number of big helicopter operators out there, George, and they put those helicopters into use for \u2013 remember, they're \u2013 we don't usually sell directly to an oil and gas guy. We sell to these helicopter operators who are then under contract, but they have contracts with oil and gas operators, they have contracts with emergency medical services operators, they have contracts with utility operators.", "So, we have to be careful. I can't just say, hey, I sold a helicopter to that firm. What's their end use? And, frankly, they could repurpose the flight, and you see that, right? So there's guys out there right now that probably have fewer contract hours with oil and gas guys but they've repurposed that aircraft to go execute either utility or emergency medical services or things like that.", "So it's kind of not really a number I have specifically that we can track exactly directly through it. Obviously, there's some guys out there that almost all they do is oil and gas and we know that, but I think that the number \u2013 and the reason I say it's quite low I really think most of these guys right now are repurposing aircraft into other markets other than oil and gas, and the aircraft that they are taking from us are primarily going into service in emergency medical and applications like that.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yeah, okay. So you're kind of making a guesstimate and figuring it's a pretty low number?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I mean, we work with these customers, we know them, but it's not something that \u2013 there's no system tracking this. It's really just our knowledge of what are their flight hours, what are they repurposing. And, again, it's more anecdotal, right? It's not, okay, I can tell you it's 17 helicopters this year got switched over from oil and gas. We don't have that kind of a hard number for you, so it's more of a color discussion.", "George D.

Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron revenues in the quarter were $3.9 billion, down 4.2% from $4.1 billion in last year's fourth quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.81 per share, up 6.6% from $0.76 in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $18 million was $534 million compared to $449 million in last year's fourth quarter.", "For the full year revenues were $13.4 billion, down 3.3% from a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $2.50 per share, up 16.3% from $2.15, last year.", "Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions of $68 million was $631 million.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Revenues were up at industrial, but at Systems, Bell and Aviation, which was due to overall decrease in revenue in the quarter. Despite the decline in revenues, we had good execution with margin improvements in aviation, systems and industrial and solid double-digit margins at Bell, with strong cash flow across all our business segments.", "At Bell, we shipped 56 commercial helicopters compared to 57 in last year's fourth quarter. Commercial revenues were down, reflecting lower aftermarket volume and a change in the mix of aircraft delivered.", "On the new product front, we are making good progress with our 525 Relentless program, we now have two aircraft in the flight test program and are preparing to bring third aircraft to the testing this spring.", "Successfully attained a top speed of 186 knots [ph] in the aircraft's maximum true airspeed target [ph] testing includes continued signal and [ph] testing as well as further development of a gross weight and center of gravity extremes. Aircraft will be head north to gather initial cold weather data next month.", "The team continues to progress through the development phase of the test program. We are preparing to enter the certification test phase in spring.", "We also plan to fly the 525 to Heli-Expo in Louisville, in March, so that our customers can see the actual aircraft for the first time.", "Overall, the aircraft continued to perform very well meeting or exceeding all of our performance expectations. Customer demand remained strong as we currently have about 80 letters of intent from around the world. We are targeting certification of first delivery of the 525 next year.", "Our 505 Jet Ranger X program was also making good progress with three test aircraft now in operation. We are targeting certification and entering the service later this year.", "Our upgraded 407 GXP model continues to generate great reception in the marketplace, with overall 407 delivers up 13 units in 2015. Earlier this month, we made the first GXP delivery to Air Methods under the 10-year 200-unit contract we signed at last year's Heli-Expo show.", "We are having good success selling our lighter [ph] helicopters. The medium segment of the market continues to be challenged. This is reflected in the low [ph] 12 volumes that we saw in 2015 and the outlook for medium helicopters remained soft as we look to 2016.", "On the defense side, V-22 deliveries were up in the quarter as we delivered eight V-22s compared to seven a year ago. H1 delivers were also up as we delivered nine units compared to seven in last year's fourth quarter.", "Moving to systems, lower year-over-year revenues in the quarter were primarily the result of initial TCDL V2 Shadow delivers in last year's fourth quarter. This year's fourth quarter revenues included delivery of 55 COMMANDO Select armored vehicles for the Afghan National Army, but did not include any Canadian TAPV deliveries as we are still conducting our internal testing.", "Having now completed initial testing, we would begin the customer testing process this week [ph]. We expect those process and final acceptance will take five to six months to complete.", "At TRU, in October, we opened our first commercial aviation maintenance training facility in Wichita, with initial courses covering mechanical and avionics maintenance for the King Air, Baron and Bonanza products. Also receipt of a certification for both, our Pro Line Fusion-equipped King Air 350 aircraft and its associated simulator.", "We give the end pilot training the new simulator at our Tampa ProFlight center supporting initial aircraft delivers in the quarter.", "Moving to aviation, we delivered 60 jets and 33 King Airs compared to 55 jets and 41 King Airs last year. For the full-year, we delivered 166 jets, up from last year's 159, including 16 Latitude deliveries.", "During the quarter, we delivered our 102 marking the solid for this product that is out in the marketplace during the two years it has been in service. More significant event during the quarter at aviation was the unveiling of our new Longitude and Hemisphere aircraft at NBAA in November. Customer reaction to both of these models has been very positive and we believe they will generate substantial growth opportunities.", "Longitude has superior operating performance compared to any aircraft in its class and should provide meaningful contributions to revenue and profits at Aviation, after its expected entering the service late next year.", "Longer-term, Hemisphere should prove to be the game changer as it we will open up entirely new market opportunity for us.", "With first flight targeted for 2019, we expect the Hemisphere will accelerate the growth in Aviation as we enter the next decade.", "We also announced details of our new single-engine turboprop, including a new 1,300 shaft horsepower GE turboprop engine. We are developing this aircraft vial class leading pilot with the range of 1,500 nautical, speeds of over 280 knots, a larger cabin and reduced operating costs.", "An important part of Textron Aviation and Bell brand is our service footprint and aftermarket support capabilities. In that regard, last week we acquired Able Engineering & Component Services, an innovative low-cost, repair and overhaul business operated in Mesa, Arizona.", "Able provides component repairs, component exchanges and replacement parts, along with other support and service offerings for commercial rotorcraft and fixed-wing aircraft customers. This business is a great extension to our aftermarket business.", "Ramping up the quarter with industrial, we achieved 6.4% increase in revenues after 5.8% negative impact from foreign exchange, reflecting strong organic growth in the quarter.", "At Caltex, we had solid growth with revenues up in Europe, North America and Asia.", "Textron Specialized Vehicles had solid growth across all business lines reflecting our focus on new products and the success of recent acquisitions such as TUG and Douglas airport Ground Support Equipment businesses.", "To summarize the year, despite a decline in manufacturing revenues, we were able to achieve a 60-basis point improvement in manufacturing margins and believe enter the year with strong EPS and cash flow performance, especially given the challenges of a weaker than expected commercial helicopter market.", "Throughout the year we took actions that should disposition our businesses for growth and profitability over the next several years.", "At Textron Systems, we advanced our Ship-to-Shore program with first two units in production. The target deliveries in 2017, the DoD exercised options for another two ships out of the total expected program of 73 units.", "At TRU, we opened our Tampa pilot training center, and Wichita maintenance training facility, [ph] the King Air training certification and announced three additional orders from Boeing for its new 737 MAX platform.", "At Industrial, our top-line growth for the year reflected our continued investment in new products such as the Jacobsen Truckster XD, heavy-duty vehicle, Cushman Hauler 4 x 4, and Greenlee AIRSCOUT Wi-Fi test system.", "Industrial growth also reflects success of recent acquisitions, which demonstrates our ability to leverage these businesses for growth and long-term shareholder value.", "At Bell, we continue to improve our win rate in the commercial helicopter market based on the attractiveness of our new and upgraded products, our industry-leading aftermarket support and our expanding sales presence around the world.", "On the military front, we made important progress with our V-280 tiltrotor program. Provider hands on demonstrations of V-280 to potential domestic and foreign customers using a flight simulator developed by our teams at Bell and TRU.", "Manufacturing and subway operations, the first aircraft are well underway and we remain on track for first flight in 2017.", "Militarized version of our Bell 412 model was selected for Japan's UHX program. We will be partnering with Fuji Heavy Industries to deliver 150 aircraft beginning in 2021.", "We also signed contracts to deliver the first three of at least 12 planned H-1 helicopter for Pakistan and the first five of 17 expected V-22s for Japan.", "Looking forward, we have a significant number of foreign opportunities for H-1s that we are pursuing and expect to secure additional orders this year.", "Textron Aviation, we began deliveries on our new Latitude announced its new single-engine turboprop, two new business jets and realize the full-year impact of operational benefits from our Beechcraft acquisition.", "To finish with Textron's 2016 financial guidance, we are projecting revenues of about $14.3 billion, as we expect solid growth at Aviation, Industrial and Systems, and approximately flat revenues at Bell.", "We expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.80 and manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions in the range of $600 million to $700 million.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $378 million, down $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, [ph] $3 million decrease in revenue.", "Let's review how each of the segments performed starting with Textron Aviation. Revenues were down $32 million from this period last year, reflecting lower King Air and pre-owned aircraft volumes, partially offset by higher jet volume.", "Aviation had a profit of $138 million compared to $130 million a year ago. This increase primarily reflected improved performance, which included lower amortization of $8 million related to fair value step up adjustments, partially offset by the lower volumes. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, down $308 million from the end of the third quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $36 million, reflecting lower commercial aftermarket volume and a change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter, partially offset by higher military deliveries. Segment profit decreased $22 million from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the change in mix of commercial aircraft delivered in the quarter and lower commercial aftermarket volume, partially offset by improved performance. Backlog in this segment ended quarter at $5.2 billion, up $76 million from the end of the third quarter.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were down $158 million, primarily due to lower unmanned systems volume, partially offset by higher Marine and Land Systems volume. Segment profit was $9 million, reflecting the impact of the lower volumes.", "Industrial revenues increased $55 million, due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a $50 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Segment profit increased $6 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher volumes.", "Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $3 million.", "Moving below the segment profit line, corporate expenses were $52 million and our tax rate in the quarter was 23.5%. The fourth quarter tax rate benefited from the U.S. R&D tax legislation passed late in the quarter as well as some of the discrete items.", "Interest expense was $32 million, down $8 million from last year, reflecting lower debt levels. We repaid $100 million of the bank loan from the Beechcraft acquisition and repurchased approximately 208,000 shares in the quarter.", "We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of $2.7 billion, resulting in year-end manufacturing debt to EBITDA multiple of about 1.8 times.", "For the full-year, we repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares at an overall cost of about $219 million.", "Turning now to our 2016 guidance beginning with our segments on Slide 9, at Textron Aviation, we are expecting about 6% revenue growth brining revenues to $5.1 billion, primarily reflecting a ramp up in Latitude deliveries.", "Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%. At Bell, we expect overall revenues will be flattish at about $3.4 billion, reflecting lower V-22 revenues, offset by higher H-1 deliveries on the military side and essentially flat revenues in our commercial business. We are forecasting margins in the range of 10% to 11%.", "At Systems, we are estimating 2016 revenues at about $1.9 billion, up 25% from last year, reflecting expected TAPV deliveries and good growth in most of our other Systems' businesses. Segment margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 10.5%.", "At Industrial, we are expecting solid growth in each of our businesses resulting in a projected 7% segment revenue growth to about $3.8 billion, with estimated margins in the range of 9% to 9.5%.", "At Finance, we are forecasting segment profit of $15 million.", "Turning to Slide 10, based on U.S. planned discount rate of 4.75%, we are estimating 2016 pension costs will be about $85 million, down from $138 million last year.", "Turning to Slide 11, R&D is expected to be about $615 million, approximately flat with 2015. We are estimating CapEx will be about $475 million, up from last year's expenditures of $420 million, reflecting our investments in new products and geographic expansion.", "Moving below the segment line and looking at Slide 12, we are projecting about $155 million for corporate expense. Next year's interest expense is estimated that the $133 million, reflecting higher rates on variable rate debt.", "We are assuming a tax rate of about 31% as we had some items in 2015 that benefited our tax rate that we do not expect will reoccur in 2016, as well as an expected higher mix of U.S. revenues in 2016, which were taxed at higher rates.", "Our guidance assumes a flat share count of about 277 million shares, reflecting repurchases sufficient to offset dilution.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Steve, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from line the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much. Good morning. I wonder if you guys could touch a little bit more on the margin in aviation flattish sequentially and kind of fairly moderate growth plan for next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "The sequential sort of flatness from Q3 to Q4 is larger driven by the fact that we had a fair bit of expense in the fourth quarter between R&D and a lot of cost associated with the ramp up of what we did from MBAA, which offset a fair bit of what we saw in some of the incremental volumes on sequential basis, nothing more [ph] within that.", "In terms of next year, the volume leverage probably is now the size you guys will expect. I think that is largely driven by the fact that we are going to see probably some lower margin on a lot of our incremental sales particularly that which is going into fractional business, so we have a fairly high number delivers next year that will go into NetJets, probably saw yesterday they have announced the official launch of that product into their customer base and typically sales into the fractional channel are at a lower margin than our typical all retail sales.", "Seth Seifman", "Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, for Bell, I think you talked about commercial being flattish and military. It sounds like maybe [ph] V-22 down and H-1 up. I wonder if you could talk about the levels, the level of decline on V-22 and is it just the bottom, then what gives you confidence on being flat in commercial.", "Scott Donnelly", "If you looked at mix in the business as you go into next year, the military and commercial are or both probably relatively flat. I think, you know, we saw a big drop-down this year obviously, with V-22 reductions earlier in the year, will continue to probably down a little, V-22 probably up a little bit on the H-1 side of things. All-in-all, are expected to be relatively flattish. I think the same is true on the commercial side.", "The big adjustment that we really made this year was a reduction in that medium-sized helicopters that you are going to see probably about 12 or 12, and we expect that to be about flat on a year-over-year basis, so I do not think there is going to be a big mix shift within the business as we look at flattish revenues. I think it is going to be true on both, the military and commercial side.", "Frank Connor", "Seth, on volumes of the V-22, it is consistent with the multiyear too, which call for a 100 units over five years. We have been delivering a little ahead of schedule. There were a few options exercised, so that is just consistent with that and then as we look forward to '18 and the Japanese deliveries, we should some recovery there.", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, the V-22s were total expected. I mean, what we saw in the military side of the business in 2015 and what we expect in '16 is entirely consistent with what we have always talked about. I mean, the programs are record in terms of the units. There are absolutely no surprises there. The issue really was largely around the commercial side and particularly on the medium segment and those are for us.", "Bell 412. That is typically a very international product, and as you can imagine know between the pressure around oil and other commodities just in general international marketplace has been pretty soft. I think that is reflected overall in the Bell 412 margin so again we expect that the pretty flat as we go from '15 to '16.", "Seth Seifman", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Yes. Hi there. I just wanted to stick with Bell for just a moment here, and, Scott, maybe have you talk a little bit about the margin outlook a bit more detail and talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes that are going on this year.", "Then as a follow-up to that, as we head into the Heli-Expo show in early March, maybe just talk a little bit about things you are going to be looking for into that show and kind of expectations around it.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. If I think on the margin rate where we have communicated you guys, we have been trying to hold that business in 11%, 12% rate. I think as we managed through knowing what was going to happen on the military programs, we adjust our cost base to make sure that we could hit that target.", "As you see in our segment level kind of color at this point, we think we are probably 100 basis points lower than that and that is a reflection of the fact that we are seeing a significant reduction in what we would have expected in terms of the value in the mid-size market as we go forward.", "Obviously, there are going to be some cost reductions that come associated with that as we lower the production rates and our role in the production rates on 412 side in particular, but to try to take out more cost from that and sustain the investments that we need to make in the 505 and 525 and V-280, that is going to us cost about 100 basis points and that is why you see that reflection of the drop.", "What we committed internal margin and how we dealt with - in fact, we are going to have is - ramp down on the military side and then further reductions that we made this year on the commercial side has sustained margins about where we want to be, but I think at this point, given where we take the forecast on 412s that is probably going to cost us about 100 basis points.", "As we going to Heli-Expo, look, it is going to be an interesting show to try to understand where customers are, what their expectations are going forward. 505, we continue to feel very good about. The level of customer demand in that area is great. 407s, as I said earlier, very strong and delivering on some big programs and we had continued strong interest.", "429s are kind of flattish. The question is really going to be with a lot of our international customers, how they feel going forward. That will reflect 412 obviously and you know give us the feel of where things are going in terms of the 525.", "We are still a year-and-a-half away from or of making first on the aircraft, so there is still a fair bit of time here to understand what the market dynamics is going to look like.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. That is great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning. Can you talk a little about the manufacturing cash flow outlook into 2016? It just seems like you have got earnings up, pension looks flat. I know CapEx is up, depreciation is about the same. Can you just talk about what else might be going against you? Why you are not seeing a bigger pick up on the cash flow line?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think if you looked - going into late next year, Sam, we are going to have a lot of inventory that we are accumulating in the build of the first lots of the 525s, and also the Longitude, so we will probably start deliveries of both of those aircraft obviously not until 2017, but we will have the priming the pump, if you will, and know those are two fairly high-dollar bid programs that will drive our working capital late in '16.", "Frank Connor", "We also are playing for some higher tax chases in '16.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. Then just in terms of the margin pickup at Systems next year. Is that all TAPV-related? Why is there such a big step up from '15 to '16?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, TAPV is certainly a big part of it. They will probably have that program going, but we expect we are going to see solid performance. If you looked at our UAS business has continued to perform well. I think the momentum is very good there. Similarly, our precision munitions business, you know, good contracts, good backlog of healthy business, so it is really across the whole segment and of course our Simulation Training business, which continues to perform and grow.", "Really, it is not just one item. I mean, certainly we getting TAPV is a big driver of the revenue increase. In terms of finally delivering on that, but in terms of overall margins, it is pretty solid performance across all of those the business segments.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard", "Hey, Scott. Good morning. Scott, there has been some signs of weakness in large cabin business jet in recent months. I was wondering if you could comment about what you are seeing in your market the, smaller and midsize end. If anything has weakened there.", "Scott Donnelly", "It really hasn't Rob. I mean, we have seen not strong growth, but we have seen increased volumes in '15. We expect again to see some increased volumes as we go into 2016. Again, it is primarily driven by new product. I would say most legacy models will be sort of flattish, but growth of new things like Latitude coming out is really, what is driving growth in the business, I think we see the market as kind of about where we expected to be. It is performing well, particularly the U.S., but it is pretty soft internationally, so I think you know at this point, products that have longer dependency on international markets are tougher markets, so we have seen know that certainly in the mid-size helicopter market, we have seen a little bit on our King Air market, because that is typically more international but the business jet market itself, which is stronger and a little more U.S.-centric at this point is doing fine.", "Robert Stallard", "Then maybe switching gears, looking at the different side of your business, we got a decent FY'16 budget goals during December. It is early days, but how do you think that will flow through Textron?", "Scott Donnelly", "I mean, I think it is good. Obviously, our key programs like V-22 and H-1 came through the process exactly where we would have expected them to be U.S. business and we just got another order on continuation of V2 program, so we are not really in a situation right now where there is a lot of big new start programs, but certainly all of our existing and important programs, be it in the aviation world or Ship-to-Shore connector or the UAS programs are all funded and in good shape.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. Did I hear you say there is another five to six months of customer testing for the TAPV; maybe give us an update of your schedule there.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Cai. Look, what happened is, we talked the fourth quarter about our expectation, we felt we could get some of the deliveries starting late next year as we had finalize our initial testing. We had a couple failures. It was a very small number, but we and the customer determined that, because it was steering-related, it could present a safety problem, so we decided we really needed to permanently resolve those things. We did that, we have completed our or internal testing, it looks great, but it does completely reset the clock on the customer test as well, so we have now started that. The vehicles are actually under test as we speak.", "It is going well, but it did reset the whole clock, so unfortunately what was a fairly minor changes and minor fix does reset the clock and that means we are probably looking at something where deliveries will probably in the second half of this year.", "Now we have built many, many of the vehicles, there is a lot of vehicles sitting there. They have been modified, you know, some minor change, so I think once delivery start, we will do very well, but it does reset the clock on the test.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Okay. Thank you.", "Frank Connor", "It is not just testing. There is the testing process in and then the acceptance process, so that is why it takes a little bit longer than what you might expect.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Got it, so aviation, you had a 0.7 book-to-bill, particularly weak, maybe give us some color on why was it so weak and color on demand maybe by product with specific reference maybe to the King Airs.", "Scott Donnelly", "Cai, I do not know that it was terribly different than what we have been sort of seeing cyclically with a lot of deliveries in Q4 on jets. You recall, last year fourth quarter we didn't have as much of drop-off, but that was also there was a pretty significant matter order that was in their which we talked about, so you know I do not think the color of the market and frankly know the position that we have today in terms of backlog is very different than what we have seen frankly for the last five or six years, so you know in terms of what we need to do in sales and conversion, for the orders and conversion of sales as we go into '16 is not is not really different than where we have been, so I think we feel pretty good about where we are.", "King Airs, we are a little bit softer in the quarter, frankly, thank I would have liked. They were up very modestly on the total year, but there is a lot of interest, there is a lot of customer discussions. Remember, we did transition from the old cockpit to the new call them fusion [ph] cockpit on that line of product here in the fourth quarter, so that also creates a little bit of a gap. I think as we have now gone through that production transition to the to the new model, we should be in pretty good shape for '16.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Last one, you are looking for flat R&D year-over-year. Could you give us a little bit of color in terms of which of your businesses the R&D might be trending up and where it might be flat to down?", "Scott Donnelly", "Not really a material change on a year-over-year basis, Cai. You know, obviously, we ramped down now on Latitude, but we are ramping up clearly on Longitude, so work going on into the Hemispheres and the turboprop, Bell 505, should wrap up this year, but we are full in the 525 and getting ready for first flight on the 280s. The number is relatively flat, and I have to say if you look across all of our different segments, the R&D spending is about the same from '15 into '16.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. Yes. Good morning. Just a question on the Bell, firstly, if you could just sort of quantify how much the commercial aftermarket sales were down in Q4, and how that pace has changed versus, say, six months ago and how you see that playing out this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I do not if we give the exact number, but I mean it is down slightly on a run rate basis and I think frankly it reflects the fact that we are seeing utilization across most of the platforms down in sort of low mid single-digits and the aftermarket tends to follow that pretty well.", "Julian Mitchell", "Understood. Then in terms of the margins for 2016 at Bell, should we think about it as you have a lot of pressure, particularly upfront in the first half just as the cost base right-sizes for the levels of commercial aftermarket and then it is about second half or would you think it is a fairly level-loaded year on margins?", "Scott Donnelly", "\u2026depending on how the 412 deliver more than anything else.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. It is really dependent on mix and deliveries. It is not a question of can we kind of get to a different type of cost structure just because of the way things are accounted for and kind of mark our military programs in our inventory, so it is really a function as Scott said kind of at this point - lower production activities and the impact quarter-to-quarter will be dependent on delivery activity.", "Scott Donnelly", "To help clarify that, last year's deliveries were units that had been produced in a higher rate and next year it is close to the inventory. It shows up next year, but that is the higher revenues on the commercial side offset that it puts spread on the margin.", "Frank Connor", "Look, It is going to vary principally as a function of 412 deliveries. The military margin rates are pretty consistent through the years and that deliveries are pretty consistent through the years. It has been largely come down to the medium-sized, particular 412 delivers as we work our way through the year.", "Julian Mitchell", "Very helpful. Then the last quick one just asset prices, I guess, your revenue as well have come in, in the past few months. Any change in view on the sort of relative merits or appeals of buyback versus M&A when you think about capital deployment this year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think our strategy is really the same. As we will always kind of keep an eye out for some M&A activity, I think Able is a great example. This is a business. It is a very healthy business. Helps to augment what we bring to customers in terms of our aftermarket capability, so those are deals we do. They are not huge deals, but that is the kind of a deal that we would do in terms of the market on stock buyback as you know we are still committed to at least offset dilution and opportunistically we will do more than that.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi, Noah.", "Noah Poponak", "Scott, I guess just conceptually, how long can you run a business with $5 billion in revenue, but only 1 billion and backlog that question pertaining to aviation. I get it has become more of the turn business than a backlog business. I get there is components of that revenue number that do not have backlog.", "I mean, it seems like it is just a risky thing to do where if you keep this kind of neutral-ish environment, you are fine, but if you were to have a more sinister backdrop, you would have to maybe cut things more sharply than you would if you were already reset to where backlog is?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, Noah, I mean the market is what it is, I guess, I mean, we have been doing this for a long time, right? where we are kind of coming in with around those kind of backlog and our team is still in aircraft, so I think that we are in a position here where we even in a pretty flat market we have been able to continue to eke out some growth on the top-line in terms of - forget the deal, right? Just organically in terms of, we sold more King Airs this year than we sold last year.", "We sold more jet thoroughly this year than we sold last year and we continue to expand the margin rate. Look, if I could pick-up someone would give me another $1 billion or so of backlog, we take it but the fact of the matter is, that is not where the market has been and it has been this way for - we were talking this morning. It has been at least six years, right, we have been kind of operating in this mode and that is just the nature of this industry right now. It is not a big announce a plane and get billions of dollars of backlog. You go out and you sell them pretty much one plane at a time and that is working for us right, so our revenue keeps going up and our margins keep expanding and that we are keep doing.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes. That makes sense. I guess the question was just more around risk mitigation of - that has been working, but if you had a tougher global macro environment that 1.1 could move sub-1 billion pretty quickly and then you are steering at a more difficult situation, I guess, but I do not know.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. Look, Noah, I mean, I appreciate the question. I understand. As I said, if I could drive a magic wand and make it a different market environment I would certainly do that. Look, where we spend most of our discretionary money is a new products, and look, the new products we have been working, right? If I was to go and say all right, guys, what if we took a different approach, what if we kind of hunker down and ride this things out, what if we did not do the Sovereign Plus or the Latitude or the M2, boy, I think without all that new product investment it would be tough to sustain a business that can grow revenues and expand margins.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes. I am definitely not advocating for that. My question is more should production be much lower on the legacy products?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look, we have taken those numbers down quite a bit over the years and I think right now, you are not seeing order builds and stuff, right? I mean, we are not pumping out white tail. We are matched pretty well on our production today over the last few years frankly has been running to demand.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes. Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "We are not generating big surplus of aircraft and we just do not do that.", "Noah Poponak", "It makes sense. On the Latitude, on the new product topic, when you had a saw at Wichita, you could see in the facility some tail numbers and you could see some tail numbers in the 30s, so if I assumed that you made it to accumulative delivery number 30, call it the middle of this year, that would get you somewhere in the vicinity of 30 of Latitude deliveries for the year. Is that in the ballpark?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Then so we should think about legacy or production excluding that roughly flat and then roughly that number for the Latitude?", "Scott Donnelly", "That is correct.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go head.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, Scott. I just want to pursue a little bit more. I know you have touched on it, but I want it to touch on it a little more. The aviation guide for margin in 2016, I mean effectively you are assuming the margins really flat with '15 because you do not have any of the step up in '16 that you had in '15. I know you commented that a lot of it is because of deliveries to fractional, but still I mean to go from what you have been - the high incrementals you have been running to a relatively minimal incremental maybe 9% at least and your guidance seems pretty darn big shifts, so I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on it?", "Scott Donnelly", "George, I mean, I think you are accurate in terms of your assessment of kind of how we get there and it certainly on the lower end of the conversion than we would normally like to see, again a big piece of it is expectations on lower margin in terms of the fractional, which is a big part of our growth frankly, right?", "If you look at that year-over-year incremental and then I know it just kind of walking through the map as well reading serial numbers of aircraft, but a lot of our incremental as we go from '15 to '16 is Latitudes and a big chunk of that is going into the fractional market, so I mean I think that is really where we are a big piece of year-over-year it is going to be fractional delivered which are at lower margin rates, still good business for us but at lower margin rates.", "George Shapiro", "One of the things that I came away with from the investor conference in Wichita was the cost that you are taking out on the Latitude versus the Sovereign in Soviet, my expectation was that the Latitude margin would start out no worse than some of the average material programs that you had. I guess that is not correct I mean or maybe it is just overwhelmed by the fractional ownership?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. It is the pricing on the fractional as oppose to the cost basis. I think we are where we wanted to be on the cost at a pretty good level. We are on the cost on the Latitudes. I mean, you are always going to have a little bit of inefficiencies in the ramp up of a new one, but it is not a material issue for us. It is doing really well. The cost is in a good place. It just really a question of pricing on fractionals.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Then just one other one, you commented I think to Cai's question earlier about the book-to-bill being low this quarter, but when I went back and looked at the book-to-bill in the fourth quarter of last year, it was actually around 1 versus the 0.7-plus that we saw this quarter, so is there any added color you could provide on that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, George. If you go back to fourth quarter last year, we did talked about the fact that we had a pretty significant international military order and those are lumpier than a normal flow, so that contributed a pretty good backlog into Q4 next year. If you took that out, the dynamic we have typically seen in Q4 is because of such a high delivery quarter has been that we see a much lower book-to-bill in Q4 as we have in recent time, so I do not think this year if you are to no back out the military deal in the fourth quarter it does not look very different on a year-over-year basis.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jeffries. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi, Sheila.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Just to harp on the aviation margin one last time. I guess is there any way you guys could see fractional impact is it over a 100 basis points, is it closer to 200 basis points to 300 basis points. Then could you remind us again what the net NetJets' order is? Is it still 25 firm and the option for a 100?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was 25 firm. It was actually 150 options, so\u2026", "Frank Connor", "\u202625 options. It was out of 150 total...", "Scott Donnelly", "Right, any way yes I think it is a few hundred basis points 200 basis points to 300 basis point, Sheila, when you think about the margin impact of sales in the fractional versus retail sales.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay. That is on the unit deliveries - the total EBIT?", "Scott Donnelly", "Correct.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Then R&D within the segment in Aviation was pretty much flat, which is impressive considering you have a new program launch and would you say SG&A should be up year-over-year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Up. Yes. It will be up modestly.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. Not a lot when the R&D is relatively is hit with other one is if you look segment-to-segment it is relatively the same as you go from '15 to '16, so not a headwind for sure.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay. Then just one on Systems, is it a second half-weighted revenue cadence like as given that you have Ship-to-Shore in TAPV, I would think in the second half of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. Particularly driven by TAPV, Sheila, the Ship-to-Shore, the development program is relatively flat through the quarters, but the TAPV will certainly be a very heavy Q3, Q4.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Johnny Wright of Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Johnny Wright", "Hi, guys. Just one question on Industrials, it is kind of exciting pretty decent growth again this year. I was just wondering what are you anticipating from military markets in 2016 and anything else you want to call out with embedded in the guide\u2026", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, the auto markets continue to be pretty healthy, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we saw growth again this year and all three regions in the North America, Europe and Asia and all the forecast yes we drive our guidance obviously in our model based on what is out there in terms of what all the OEMs are saying.", "Right now, they are all forecasting rolled again in 2016 and so we expect obviously to grow with that. We had some nice wins on new models, which is helping to drive our growth, so our growth has been in excess of what overall markets have done on the auto side and I expect that will be through again in 2016.", "Johnny Wright", "Okay. Great. That is all I have. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay. Sure.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "John Walsh", "Hi. This is John Walsh on the line for Jeff. Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. Good morning, John.", "John Walsh", "A lot of ground covered, I just had one quick question on pricing totally understand what is going with the fractional business. Could you kind of just comments on like-for-like pricing what you saw in the quarter and what you are expecting in the guidance?", "Scott Donnelly", "It has been pretty flat, John. I mean some are rough a little bit, some are kind of flat, but all-in-all it is not materially different than a fairly stable price environment.", "John Walsh", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "Thanks guys. Just a couple of quick one on aviation, Scott, aviation aftermarket kind of last year and this year is it similar to the Bell commercial aftermarket trends and I was just wondering if you could talk aviation Citation pre-on your pricing and activity wise?", "Scott Donnelly", "On the aftermarket on a comparable basis, we are pretty flat I mean we had some changes in how we recognized revenue in terms of some engine programs so we have talked about before this does not affect our profitability but just the revenues we are basically in between the customer and the engine sides so all-in-all I think it is relatively flat and we expect frankly on a comparable basis, so a slight uptick in aftermarket in 2016 from '15 and similarly on the use aircraft pricing it has been fairly stable.", "Pete Skibitski", "Great. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Frank, a quick question on the balance sheet and maybe Scott on capital deployment, so is the idea to refine the notes coming due or repay and start to reduce that further, it seems like you are getting to a point where point or you are comfortable, so Scott is that M&A aperture actually increasing as there is more excess free cash flow here? Thanks.", "Frank Connor", "Yes. Well, from a balance sheet standpoint, we will probably refine what we kept coming due this coming year, so we are pretty comfortable now with our debt levels you know that the balance sheet has we have had good flexibility over the past couple of years, we think from and M&A standpoint so I do not think that there is a really change in the M&A aperture. We feel like we have been able to kind of do the things that we wanted to do and we will be able to continue to do that, but we will stop paying down debt at these levels.", "Scott Donnelly", "Look our debt levels are getting developed where they should be from a ratio standpoint, but I would add the same color Frank did. We will do deals that we think makes sense. We have not felt in any way constrained. Clearly , we have access to the market if we need to do that if the right deal came along, but we are not going to do deals that we do not think make sense and we are certainly not going to run around and try to find stuff or force stuff that we do not think fits in the business for well just to deploy that way I think our M&A strategy is one where if we see opportunities it is a great fit we think we get good leverage it supports the balance of our business we will do.", "Myles Walton", "I see that, but if you are starting to generate excess cash. It is not going back to paying down debt is all I am kind of getting at if you kind of think about the 600 million, 700 million pre pension you get a 100 repo and another sub-100 to dividend and so you are starting to have excess cash I am just curious if any apertures can get better or be you want to be more opportunistic maybe on the industrial sides if the rest of the world kind of constant kind of the rates in that sector?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. Again, I do not think our cash on the balance sheet thing is particularly excessive yet. I mean, so that's and it is not like we are worry about [to] cash we will continue to be pretty aggressive that looking for opportunities across all our business on the acquisition side and as that will also be opportunistic around the share buyback in terms of deploying that capital hope we think it makes sense and based where the...", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "The last question in the queue at this time comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ron Epstein", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Frank Connor", "Good morning, Ron.", "Ron Epstein", "A couple of big picture questions for you. On Hemisphere, when you think about it. I know it is still early days, but with Gulfstream G450s coming off the line and my understanding is that they are selling in for not too much over $30 million. Is not that a really difficult place to try to put a new product? I mean with Gulfstream there with the Bombardier guys there with peso there it seems pretty crowded?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, I think, when we look at the Hemisphere and how we size the Hemisphere. Our intent is to be sort of just below where that market is because you are right I think you know the 450, 550 is the global 7,000, 8,000 there is 7x, 8x. It is not our intent to be competing with that guy, so if somebody is looking at G450, the Hemisphere is designed to be slotted sort of one tier below that echelon of aircraft.", "We think that is the market were there has been a lot of reinvestment by a lot of big iron guys, which is why we are going there not with the intent of going up and joining in that area, because I think you are right. I think it is a well-served market. In terms of current pricing, I have no idea. That market cycle is just mid-size cycle, so where pricing and demand is right now is a function of the market, but the intent that we have with Hemisphere is that slots just below before you get into those big iron guys.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay. Then I think - totally changing gear sort of just real quick, kind of a little bit out of mind immediate comfort zone, but Caltex have you guys seen any weakness in ISR for auto?", "Scott Donnelly", "No. We have not.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay. Good.", "Scott Donnelly", "It has been result.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay. That is good to know. Finally, I cannot you know not get on the phone with you guys and not ask you about the Scorpion, any update there?", "Frank Connor", "The Scorpion, look, I think the good news is that one of the most critical issues for that program was always determining the path certification. I think the good news is through a lot of work last year, the air force has now opened up the ability go through an airworthiness process with the air force. They initiated that program and obviously we fully expect to participate in that, so we have the first aircraft that will be conforming test articles in production as we speak and are working with the air force to get under contract to have them conduct and ultimately provided airworthiness certification for the aircraft, so that is a big step forward for us.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay. That is great. Is there sense of any opportunity for it maybe an Air National Guard, anything like that?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think, eventually there could be either - obviously, there is a lot going on budget wise it the U.S. Government, but we have always thought that while this is certainly intended more as international product for a lot of countries that can afford to fly the F-22s and F-35s of the world. We certainly think that capability aircraft might be one at that price point and that capability could be attractive for a lot of missions that could include U.S.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay. Great. Cool. Thanks, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Frank Connor", "Sure. All right. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's penal, I would like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

Welcome to the Textron First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Doug Wilburne. Please go ahead.", "Doug Wilburne", "Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention, we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.2 billion, up $128 million from last year\u2019s first quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.55 per share, up 19.6% from $0.46 reported in last year\u2019s first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $222 million use of cash compared to $125 million use of cash in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Doug and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up 4.2% in the quarter, reflecting the success of our strategy of investing for growth, both in new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up in Industrial, Aviation and Systems, while essentially flat at Bell, consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year\u2019s first quarter, 10 H-1s, up four units from last year and 30 commercial helicopters, down from 35 a year ago.", "On the commercial side, we had a good showing at HELI-EXPO, where we displayed actual flight test articles of our new 525 Relentless and 505 Jet Ranger, though both of which generated significant interest. At the show, we signed a letter of intent for 10 525s with Guangxi Diwang Group, a Chinese investment company. More recently, we also signed an LOI with PT Whitesky Aviation, an Indonesian operator for 30 505s. Development on both programs are proceeding well. The three test 505 helicopters are completed over 700 test hours with certification and first deliveries expected later this year.", "The 525 has two aircraft and flight test, with a third unit expected to enter soon. The aircraft is meeting or exceeding all of its performance objectives, including having demonstrated a top speed in excess of 200 knots. The effectiveness of 525\u2019s integrated fly-by-wire design has been evident during the testing by the aircraft superior in flight handling, maneuverability and stability. Combined, these factors should significantly contribute to the value of this aircraft for our customers.", "At HAI, we also announced the new Bell customer advantage plan or CAP which provides our customers the opportunity to lock in predictable cost effective maintenance for their aircraft. Our CAP product delivers broad cover solutions for our customer\u2019s daily operation, which in turn protects the value of their investment, while increasing aircraft availability. We were also named number 1 helicopter service and support for the 22nd consecutive year by Pro Pilot Magazine.", "On the H-1 front, we have received recent orders from the DoD for 61 additional units, including 9 FMS units for Pakistan. This takes production through the first quarter 2019. The remaining US DoD program of record and significant introduction of foreign military demand provide a solid long-term outlook for this program.", "Moving to Systems, revenues were up modestly primarily driven by higher unmanned systems volumes. During the quarter at Textron Marine and Land Systems we received $174 million contract for five additional Ship-to-Shore units to be delivered in 2020. Earlier this month, we were also awarded a contract for 60 COMMANDO Select armored vehicles to be delivered this year in Iraq and Colombia.", "On the Canadian TAPV program we're on track for deliveries beginning in the third quarter as we successfully completed the customer reliability testing program two weeks ago. At TRU Simulation + Training we were just awarded another contract by Boeing to design and manufacture simulators for their newest twin-aisle airplane the 777x. ", "Moving to Industrial, we saw 9.2% increase in revenue reflecting our continued investments. During the quarter at specialized vehicles, we launched our newest Bad Boy product, the Onslaught 550, a mid-size 4 by 4 ATV. At Jake we announced the HR700 which is the world\u2019s first 14 foot wide rotary mower providing increased productivity for our professional turf care customers. At Tools and Test new products in our look electric utility space are driving significant growth in this category. At Kautex, our selective catalytic reduction products and geographic expansion drove growth in excess of global vehicle production rates. ", "Moving to Textron Aviation, we delivered 34 jets in the quarter compared to 33 last year and 26 King Airs compared to 25 last year. Our sales success affirms that our strategy of investing in new products is resonating with aircraft buyers. During the first quarter we also received European certification for the Latitude as well as the ProLiant Fusion equipped King Air 250 and 350. Advanced sales of Latitude fractionals by NetJets to their end customers have been going very well and we look forward to starting deliveries of the new aircraft later this summer. ", "To sum up, we had a good start to the year as demand in our end markets finished the quarter generally consistent with what we were expecting. Operationally we also had another good quarter as we achieved margin improvements at each of our manufacturing segments. We continue to believe that we will be able to generate solid overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash this year.", "And with that I will turn the call over to Frank. ", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $280 million, up $21 million from the first quarter of 2015 on a $128 million increase in revenues. Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.", "At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $40 million from this period last year primarily due to higher jet volume. Segment profit was $73 million, up from $67 million a year ago. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1 billion; $47 million lower than at the end of the fourth quarter", "Moving to Bell, revenues were essentially flat as higher military revenues offset lower commercial revenues. Segment profit increased $6 million from the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to improved performance. At Systems, revenues were up $9 million primarily due to higher unmanned systems volumes while segment profit was up $1 million. Industrial revenues increased $80 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $9 million also reflecting the higher volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $1 million.", "Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $32 million compared to $43 million last year reflecting the impact of a lower stock price on our share based compensation expense. Interest expense was $33 million, flat from last year. During the quarter we issued $350 million in 10-year notes at a rate of 4%. This was effectively prefunding the retirement of $250 million in 4.625 notes that are set to mature in September. We also repurchased 6.2 million shares of stock during the quarter returning $215 million in cash to shareholders.", "To wrap up with guidance, we are confirming our expected full year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 a share and cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.", "This concludes our prepared remarks So, Greg, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes, thank you very much. So your aviation volume was up, but your inventory step up was down. Maybe give us some color in terms of why the profitability wasn\u2019t a little bit better?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Cai, I think you look at the first quarter, the revenue increase was fairly modest. So in terms of leverage, we are talking about sort of what I recall the lot of small numbers. We I think that had pretty good execution by the team. We had an awful lot of R&D spending frankly as we are getting ready to do the first Longitude flight here coming up in the early part of this summer. And so even with the step up, as you note in there, which was probably $5 million, $6 million something like that. That was more than offset by a fair bit of R&D spending to get ready for the Longitude. So there is nothing fundamentally different. I don\u2019t think -- the mix obviously was more biased towards Latitudes than some of our legacy aircraft, but that\u2019s something we expected and kind of talked about in the context of our overall guidance for the segment leverage for the year, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing kind of play through.", "Cai von Rumohr", "And then a last follow up, so should we assume that the Latitude is a mix negative in terms of your shipment? And also could you comment on the level of used aircraft losses if any? ", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I think \u2013 as we talked about, I think the Latitude mix will be a slight drag in terms of our normal gross margin flow through. We expect obviously that should improve over time. It\u2019s still a good product for us, but it\u2019s a little bit lower on the mix side and some of our other aircraft at this point. You know, used aircraft, there were some losses in the quarter, but they were de minimis, I mean, they are not a material number. ", "Cai von Rumohr", "Thank you. ", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from RBC. Please go ahead. ", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks guys, good morning. Scott, there has been a lot of negativity in the last couple of months by the business jet demand environment. Used inventories seem to have gone up, pricing softened. I was wondering what [indiscernible] we are seeing out there in terms of customer interest and how confident you are in your forecast for 2016 in this division?", "Scott Donnelly", "Robert, I would say that if we look at the first quarter, there is no question that January and February were pretty rough letting. The turmoil in the market and general sentiment, I mean, I think caused a lot of people to sort of stop, and wait and see what\u2019s going on. But as we went in through March, I would say continuing now into April, the market has been pretty good. I mean, we would always like to see it stronger, but the momentum that we felt in the latter part of last year certainly took a pause through January, February, but has returned to a pretty decent market here in March going into April. ", "Robert Stallard", "And then as a follow up, Frank, obviously you highlighted the buyback was strong in Q1. Do you expect it to moderate going forward and will you be more interested in acquisitions perhaps?", "Frank Connor", "Well, as we said, I mean, we will continue to take a look at what the acquisition opportunities look like, our cash flow needs and we returned excess capital to shareholders. As you say, we don\u2019t kind of \u2013 we did a lot of that in the first quarter. We will continue to look at kind of the appropriate use of capital as we go through the year. But we are ahead of the game in terms of our -- certainly our plan do that we saw set dilution at this point. ", "Robert Stallard", "That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning. Just following up on our last comment about the share count. Do you still assume it\u2019s going to be the 277 million shares? I know that it was heavy in the first quarter. Will that be lower for the year? ", "Frank Connor", "It should be lower for the year by about the number over the normal dilution, so kind of 3-ish million. We bought about 3 million more than our normal employee plan dilution would reflect, it would be lower by about that amount. ", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about Bell and what you have seen as far as demand on the 412s and as the relatively stronger dollar hurt you in those sales, I guess, I am wondering with two deliveries in the first quarter, are we still on track for 12 of them?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that the commercial market is still challenging for sure on the helicopter side, and exchange rates US dollar doesn\u2019t help us particularly. But the 412, I would say our line of sight on the year for the guidance we provided, which was around 12, I think is firming up. So I think we feel pretty good about that. And there is certainly opportunities out there as we look into the out years and there is deals that still need to close, but there is still \u2013 it\u2019s a great helicopter, it serves its purpose very well, it\u2019s got a great customer base and there is still people looking at expanding increasingly their fleet to 412. So I'd say we have pretty reasonable line of sight onto the 2016 in our working opportunities that are going out in the \u201817, \u201818 at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "I guess on R&D can you talk about the expectations for R&D for the full year may be on a segment basis? And then also in terms of headcount, I think you added headcount across three of the four segments with the exception of Bell and may be what that additional capacity is for?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Sheila I would say that the total year R&D is probably going to be pretty consistent with what we guided which we only do for the total company level. There is always a little bit of timing in this thing, I mean clearly with getting ready for the flight test programs and whatnot at Aviation on the longitude program we spent a disproportionate amount of that in terms of the run rate getting ready for flight test. So, the other programs are running about as we expected there is really no change to the guidance, the 525 flight test programs are going very well but consuming expenses at about the pace we expected. 280 is going very well, we\u2019ve got some nice significant milestones in the fabrication of that first unit for flight next year. So I think our guidance for the total year remains unchanged, we just had some higher spending here in the first quarter particularly aviation getting ready for the longitude program.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "And then on headcount?", "Scott Donnelly", "The headcount numbers, I don't - I'm not sure, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me Sheila. I don't think there is any big material changes, the only place we\u2019ve had really material changes in headcount unfortunately have really been around Bell and that's mostly been dialing back some of the production run rates in Bell on the commercial helicopter front. Other than that it's been I think relatively stable in most of the businesses.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "And then just a follow-up on the demand question I asked earlier. It's pretty original but can you just talk about pricing and maybe if the competitive environment has changed at all?", "Scott Donnelly", "In?", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "In more so in aviation I guess.", "Scott Donnelly", "Aviation has been fairly flattish on a year-over-year basis Sheila as there are a couple of models that have seen a little bit of an uptick in price, a couple have been a little been down in price but overall not a big impact in pricing really across the whole company, pricing has been relatively flat. As I said, I think part of it is just we had to be a little bit patient her as we went through a couple pretty tough months and hanging in there but the demand environment which is really kind of in the end what drives it picked up in March and felt pretty good.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Maybe I\u2019ll go back to Bell. Scott, can you talk a little bit about the next multi-year on the V-22, there has been some recent press reports out there about that\u2019s shaping up, can you maybe provide a little bit of a color on your thoughts on that that would be helpful, particularly on the volumes?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, so I'd start by saying that it's early in that process, so we've already started to work with the customer on providing information. Right now the challenge is it\u2019s a pretty broad range of volumes depending on, as they\u2019re working on their budget for those out years and obviously it\u2019s you know there is a mix of what they want to do with the program of record for the marine core, you've been some articles out there about the air force having an interest in some additional CVs, there is the Navy card program, and how that starts to drive demand as well as creating some optionality around FMS opportunities. So, right now it's a - when we're providing numbers it\u2019s across a pretty broad range of units, so it's at this point I'd be reluctant to put a number out there, seriously I don't think there is anyone who would want to guide to yet to give you guys an idea because it's just the range of opportunity is just too high in terms of you know where that number falls out it could it\u2019s just you know they\u2019re running the numbers, running the financials and asking us for a lot of input on a pretty broad range of possible numbers of units.", "Jason Gursky", "Let me ask you it differently, without FMS, the top end of that range allow you to hold current production rates?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I don't think it's likely that we will hold current production rates, it's going to be you know it will be south of that I really don't see a potential outcome that would be the current production rate, so we are planning for another detriment down when we get out there into that \u201819, \u201920 timeframe, but it\u2019s -- we just don\u2019t know how big that detriment is going to be right now. When you look at Navy, that\u2019s 40 some units, there is still 20 some in the Marine Corp program of record, there can be a couple of CVs, there can be some optionality built in for FMS, but I do not think that the expectation should be it would run at the current run rates.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. Understood. And then the follow-on, the LOI with regard to the 505 and the 525, can you just remind us during those converts into actual contracts, when will you start telling its or have a better idea of what your ramp is going to look like on deliveries for both of those aircrafts, so just kind of the timing of the LOIs converting the contracts.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we\u2019ll start to see conversion on 505 contracts, probably starting here pretty soon. Those aircraft, we\u2019ll be looking at the initial deliveries likely in the fourth quarter. So there is already conversations going on with customers that are -- will convert those to actual contracts. I would say on the 525, you won\u2019t likely see that until sometime as you get closer to certification in mid-summer or so. Last year, next year, rather with just because our certification expectations are kind of late summer, early fall before we would start firming those up for deliveries by the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "Hi, good, morning, guys. Hey, Scott, geographically, is North America kind of still the only game in town. I think you\u2019ve been running, I don\u2019t know, 75% of your citation deliveries were North America and I think a similar amount at Bell Commercial. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s the status and if there is any change that you detect in the North American market versus three or four months ago.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, certainly on the Aviation side, it\u2019s still more or less US driven. I think jets this quarter were probably about 80% US deliveries, about 20% international deliveries. If you look at our turboprop product between the King Air and the Caravans, those are more like 50-50 US and International and that\u2019s more typical for those products and I think the turboprops are doing well. Caravans, particularly in China, are strong. So we -- but I would say however, we were starting to see some momentum pick up a little bit in Europe. So I think you\u2019ll start to see some increased jet deliveries over there. And turboprop, again, staying fairly balanced between US and international as we go through the balance of the year.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay. Got you. And then last one, just wondering what your expectation was on this air force nuclear helicopter program. I think basically you guys are the incumbent, it\u2019s I think a few billion dollars probably and there has been a lot of chatter that they would still source it to a competitor. I\u2019m just wondering what your expectation is there and if you had any thoughts?", "Frank Connor", "Well, we\u2019re probably seeing and hearing the same things that you\u2019re hearing. It sounds like we are the incumbent, but those helicopters have been there, those are Hueys from a long time ago. And at least the requirements that we\u2019ve seen out there, we think they\u2019re looking for a larger and different helicopter. So we\u2019re seeing and hearing the same chatter. It sounds like they\u2019re looking at going sole source to another product at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good morning, guys. Just, Scott quickly, wondered if you could give us some color on what you saw in service revenues across Aviation and Bell in the quarter.", "Scott Donnelly", "So on the Aviation side, it was pretty consistent with where we\u2019ve been. I think it was around 35% of revenue on the helicopter side, [indiscernible] but it was down a bit year-over-year and again, I think that\u2019s just reflecting that we continue to see lower utilization, particularly in the oil and gas segment in the marketplace.", "Carter Copeland", "When do you think you reach a bottom on that, I mean clearly there is some destocking in that end market. So when do you start to lap some of the easier compares there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Hard to say, Carter. I mean I would be just making a total guess, but I think a lot of it\u2019s going to have to do with obviously what happens with oil prices and when do guys start utilizing assets. I can tell you, down in the gulf, where we have an awful lot of foreclose that are operating with oil prices being down, things have been slower. Frankly, some customers have been slow to pay some of the operators that we\u2019ve worked and so as a result, those guys will put aircraft on the ground or they will back off in general, but it\u2019s got to go through its cycle. So I am not probably the right guy to opine on the oil prices and what that recovery looks like, but I think it will tie more to that going forward.", "Carter Copeland", "Great. And then on Systems, just a quick follow-up. Anymore color you can give us on the unmanned revenue in the quarter, did it have a negative mix impact for the margins?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think the unmanned is probably in line with typically what we expect for margins in that business. We've seen fairly high utilization on our fee for service programs which are going well. The aircrafts are performing well and executing the contracts that we have. We've continued to deliver the upgrades for the Shadow V2 program and those are kind of flowing through exactly as we expected and we've got some decent business development work going on for some international sales and things like that. So I think everything in the unmanned world is good. The margins obviously we were this quarter fairly light at Marine and Land Systems because we will largely generate a lot of the revenue here in the third and fourth quarter associated with the Canadian TAPV program obviously getting that milestone in the test complete was a big deal for us. So I think each of the units are doing well and are where we expect it to be. Unmanned is good business and margin is consistent with our expectations.", "Carter Copeland", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Hi, good morning. Just wanted to start with the first question on aviation margins because I guess in Q1 you were talking earlier about how the margins were a couple of 100 points short of the full year margins hogged in aviation based off of mix of leverage - volume leverage and also R&D. As we think about the rest of the year and how you make up that 200 bps, should we think about that as fairly evenly split between R&D tailing off and leverage recovering or is there some sort of waiting between the two?", "Scott Donnelly", "Julian, I mean, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t read a whole lot into the Q1 numbers, right, I mean, the revenue was up $40 million, so leverage on $40 million couple of million of \u2013 few million of R&D, a couple of million of this or that just makes such as huge swing. So I don\u2019t think there is anything that I would look at the first quarter granted \u2013 yeah, just in terms of specifically R&D, the R&D spending is probably somewhat disproportionate in terms of the overall impact on margins here in Q1 that it would be in the latter quarters, but I really don\u2019t there is anything fundamental we\u2019ve looked at in the leverage issue in the first quarter as being indicative of what's going to happen in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So our guidance that we provided you guys around sort of that window of overall operating margin percent I think we're on track to do and the revenue side. So the leverage is going to pretty consistent I think with what we told you and again the number in Q1 is such a small incremental on the revenue that I don\u2019t think you can read a whole lot into in terms of leverage.", "Julian Mitchell", "Very clear. And then my follow-up would be around the manufacturing cash outflow, that was about 100 million higher year-on-year. The vast majority of that is due to working capital stepping up, but at the same time your buyback spend in Q1 suggests you're very confident of that cash flow swinging around. So maybe just give a little bit of background as to where that big working capital build really came. And do you think we should see the manufacturing cash flow swing positive in the second quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "So I think first of all on an absolute basis you guys know we generally consume cash in the first quarter. We tend to have inventory build associated with products that do sell off good, better in different aviation and they will tend to have more higher sales in the latter part of the year. So on an absolute basis I don\u2019t think there is anything terribly surprising. In terms of the year-over-year comparative, we do have situation with respect to customer deposits primarily almost exclusively frankly on the military side of Bell where as a result of performance based payments over the last couple of years we had favorable position in terms of working capital which will unwind through the course of this year and that\u2019s a good part of what you are seeing here in the first quarter. But those numbers are absolutely consistent with what we guided you guys in the overall cash numbers. So we will see that working capital impact through the course of the year, but again completely planned and consistent with expectation and so we have no change in our confidence in terms of our overall cash flow for the year.", "Julian Mitchel", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. ", "George Shapiro", "Yes, Scott, I wanted to pursue a little bit more this R&D. So you\u2019ve made a comment first thing that the R&D spend was more than offset what was maybe 5 million step up in fees, could you quantify how much more it offset and then how much lower the R&D might be in the subsequent quarters?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the dynamics we have in the quarter, George, for sure, we have the last quarter really of any of the step up impact on accounting in aviation, that was about $5 million number. And all I am saying is that our spending on the R&D side on a year-over-year basis to be comparative was a number that was quite bigger than that. So it was \u2013 of you take those two significant pieces that was dilutive to our margin rate or overall leverage if you will on a year-over-year basis. But again, in either case where these huge numbers, it\u2019s just when you\u2019re looking at a $40 million increase in revenue, the difference between 4 million better in margin and 8 million better in margin, 10% leverage, 20% leverage, you\u2019re talking about a couple of million dollars. So it\u2019s \u2013 none of these number are big numbers.", "George Shapiro", "Got it. And I was just wondering \u2013 R&D 10 million versus say the step up in 5 million [ph] in the quarter, I am just trying to roughly calculate what that impact might be, and then how much higher R&D was this quarter than what you might expect it to be in subsequent quarters?", "Scott Donnelly", "George, it was on the order of about 10 million. I mean, I think for a modeling purpose that\u2019s about the right number to put in there. Again, it\u2019s not a particularly big number. And we don\u2019t expect it to change our overall company R&D over the course of the year. It\u2019s a relatively small number, but it\u2019s on that magnitude.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. So does R&D go down a little bit then in the subsequent quarters?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, but again not by a very big number, because it was only up by a very small number. ", "George Shapiro", "Frank, just to qualify the tax rate was, more like 30% this quarter versus the 31% guide, are we going to still see 31% or is 30% a better number?", "Frank Connor", "I gave you the 31, it obviously depends on at the end of the day, kind of what our international versus domestic mix is and we will know that until we move further through the year. But I continue to use 31. ", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And one last one Scott, orders this year versus last year\u2019s first quarter were up like 90 million or so, almost 10%, was that still primarily domestic or did you see more of the orders from international at all this quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "I wouldn\u2019t say on the jet side, most of orders in the quarter were US. I think we will see a more international mix here, certainly as we are proceeding through April into Q2. ", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much and good morning. I will really beg for your indulgent to ask one more question about aviation margin, which is just about \u2013 if you look what\u2019s implied for the remainder of the year, it looks fairly flat with what you did in Q2, Q3, Q4 overall last year, excluding the inventory step up and so to have flat margins year-on-year in aviation for the rest of the year, when it would seem like more latitude deliveries to [indiscernible] would be a headwind. What sort of the opposing factor that allows you to keep those margins flat?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think in general performance in the business is \u2013 I mean, the guys are executing well and we do have some volume that\u2019s increased on a year-over-year basis. And we still have good gross margin products, so that those create some leverage to help offset some of what might be a bit of a negative mix on a year-over-year comparative basis in terms of the mix of aircraft.", "Seth Seifman", "And then just as a follow-up also in terms of the pickup in activity that you've seen in March and April in terms of where is it across, would you say it's across platforms or is there any place where it\u2019s concentrated. And one of the reasons I ask and that we\u2019re talking about small numbers though it's hard to tell but if you just look at the high end, the Sovereign and X deliveries were fairly low in Q1, I know Q1 is light but is that a place where you're seeing kind of incremental weakness in demand relative to the other platforms?", "Scott Donnelly", "It's probably some of which we\u2019re seeing is with the latitude in there we do see some aircraft that may be a year or two years ago could have been a Sovereign are now going to be a Latitude. So, the aircraft in terms of the range and performance are different and for a lot of our customers the Sovereign is still the right answer and that's why we still see reasonable sales of Sovereign but for sure when we look at the total number of aircraft in that Sovereign space, some of those are now becoming Latitude. So if someone is in the middle of the country or they are in Europe or they\u2019re in a place where about 2,000 nautical miles will get you there, they\u2019re tending to air on the side of a Latitude versus Sovereign, so that explains kind of where I think we are on Sovereigns. And on TENs as we\u2019ve said that's a fairly unique product, it\u2019s been a very popular product over time but it's relatively small number of units each year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "It sounded like in the fourth quarter, the thing here is maybe we\u2019re a little bit supreme on the international side, but I guess Scott some of your commentary there seems that like you had seen a pickup as expected and so I expect you and your growth in King Air?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yeah, I mean I think we've seen the King Air market being pretty solid in most applications, I\u2019d say it's been a little lighter on special missions that it has in the past and that\u2019s a little bit of what we saw in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. But remember we also had the conversion going from the old cockpit to the new model that came out very late last year and so getting that into production, getting the last of the older models sold and now making that conversion to the new model also has some impact on volume but frankly with the new model out there is selling well, we just got certification in Europe, which is [indiscernible] is a big deal for us, so I think we feel pretty good about the King Air market and where it\u2019s going.", "Myles Walton", "And just a clarification on the margins, the pension tailwind year-over-year expected have been 10 million to 15 million across the segments and may be deviation in five of that, is that about the right way to think about the tailwind from pension?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, It was probably somewhere around that $10 million number but most of that is actually taking at corporate just the way we - well, I mean we spread out but it wouldn't be 5 at aviation, that\u2019s going to be a smaller number than that. So I wouldn't - I don't have the exact number in front of me but it's relatively --.", "Frank Connor", "There is a benefit but its spread around the organization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Sprague", "Just a couple of questions on cash flow, Frank thanks for the color on the or maybe it was Scott, the military dynamics but just kind of think about the quarter here. Accounts receivable and inventories were both actually up, I would guess that Bell issue was actually in some accrued accounts somewhere, can you speak to what was going on in the accounts receivables and inventories in the quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "The issue I talked about on Bell is in the working capital line Jeff, so that\u2019s where it\u2019s reflected.", "Jeff Sprague", "I'm just looking at the absolute growth in receivables and inventories in the quarter --.", "Frank Connor", "Jeff, just to be clear the comment on customer deposits was a first quarter last year to first quarter this year versus end of year last year to this quarter so --.", "Jeff Sprague", "And then just shifting to pension, do you foresee continued contributions at this level or if there is a potential that those need to kind of move up in the out years?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it obviously Jeff depends on returns and discount rates and everything else but we don\u2019t see meaningful contributions beyond these levels in the near term unless there is some significant change in the market dynamics.", "Jeff Sprague", "And then I was also just wondering and back to the tax rate, Frank, there is this FASB change on stock comp that can be adopted this year. It's not required until next year, but we are seeing a few companies adopt that. Has that been a concern this year and is that something that could meaningfully impact your tax rate if you adopt?", "Frank Connor", "I think, we are looking at it, but as I said stick with 31 is the right place to think about things.", "Jeff Sprague", "And then one just last one. Could give us some idea of what percent of the Aviation backlog is the NetJets Latitudes or someway to just kind of think about that?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, we don\u2019t get into that level of detail on the backlog, Jeff, but the only thing I will say around the NetJets thing is that we really don\u2019t put stuff in from that just into the backlog until we have agreed delivery dates and tail numbers and that stuff. So we will incrementally add NetJets to that backlog only when we - NetJets says, hey, look this is when I want delivery, this is the date, this is the tail and so there is only a small percentage of that overall order is in backlog today and that will grow the number we\u2019ve put in there fairly linearly as they start taking deliveries and start committing to the next aircraft delivery date.", "Jeff Sprague", "Great. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Justin Bergner", "Good morning, Scott, good morning, Frank.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Justin Bergner", "I want to ask a good question on the industrial business. Would it be possible for you to give us a sense as to how the different parts of the industrial segment grew relative to that 6.5% organic constant currency growth in that business?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yeah, we can provide some color around that. I did have that number right in front of me. But if you looked at the overall growth rates we are \u2013 I am not sure how to break it out exactly. Our specialized vehicle business had pretty reasonable growth. We had relatively flat market in our tools and test world, but again there is the dynamics within that which we kind of talked a little bit about. I think we are doing very well in the utility space. A lot of the other tools that were re highly consumed by a lot of the oil and gas exploration kind of guys obviously continues to be soft, but net there were some growth in that segment. We had very solid growth on the automotive side of things on a year-over-year basis. And the turf care world was relatively flat.", "Justin Bergner", "Thank you. That's helpful. Given that the first quarter in the industrial business is tracking slightly ahead of your full year goal, should we think about the industrial business as being a segment that could exceed your earlier guidance or are there parts of the business that you don't expect to be quite as strong as you look through the rest of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we feel pretty good about where we're right now. The guys in pretty much all the businesses had a pretty solid quarter, but it\u2019s probably little early in the year to feel like we would materially change the range on what we told you with respect to the segment. So certainly they are on the tracks right now, they would be towards the high end of it, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty early in the year too. ", "Justin Bergner", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ", "Ronald Epstein", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning, Ronald.", "Ronald Epstein", "Just maybe a couple of quick details. You guys announced that you won 777x flight simulator at Mechtronix, so congratulations on that. How big is that potentially? I mean how do we think about that for the Mechtronix business?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s a good question. So the - and I have to be careful, because I don\u2019t know exactly all that was disclosed with our customer but certainly the scope of that contract is to provide the simulators for their use as well as their training centers. And beyond that obviously a lot of Boeing\u2019s 777 customers will buy their own simulators for doing their own pilot training. So I think the scope of the contract that we have is for the sales directly to Boeing, but obviously from our perspective, while that's a great contract and we're thrilled to have it, it also gives us, we think, the position in the marketplace that we should win our fair share of end customers from Boeing who buy their own simulators. So it\u2019s the contract value specifically associated with Boeing plus future opportunities that are still to be determined.", "Ronald Epstein", "Now, just -- maybe just for clarity, thanks for that, but this is a bigger -- Mechtronix historically wasn\u2019t as big a player, right, in large commercial, right, and this is a nice new segment, business for them, correct or no?", "Scott Donnelly", "It is. So true and we bought Mechtronix obviously. Part of the rationale for the acquisition was, we felt they had some terrific technologies, very capable team and a great product, but they were a very small company and they had had some challenges and got a little over-leveraged at one point and ran into some financial trouble. And I -- that hurts you in that market, because when you look at big customers, whether it's a Boeing or a lot of the major airlines in the world, these assets are like an aircraft. They're very long-lived, right. So companies want to know when you're buying a fairly high dollar capital item that you're going to be able to be around and provide the service and support and upgrades and such overtime and I do think that one of the things that hampered them in the marketplace was as a result of their financial struggles, they had some uncertainty around them. ", "So it wasn't a technical or a product problem, it was a business viability issue and obviously, when we acquired them and sort of put our balance sheet and reputation behind it, that kind of got rid of that sort of barrier with a lot of customers. So the team up there won the 737 MAX a couple of years ago. I think that they've executed very, very well on that. The Boeing folks obviously have been very happy with how the team has performed on the 737 MAX and that gave them confidence to then also make us their partner on the 777X. So if you execute well and perform well, it can sort of snowball on the right direction. But for sure, part of the underlying thesis of the deal was that we thought you had a company that had a lot of great technology, great product, great capability, but it needed to have a little more certainty and strength from a financial standpoint and I think we've provided that.", "Ronald Epstein", "Cool. Thank you for that. And then one more, my favorite airplane, the Scorpion, where do we stand on international interest, potential order that kind of thing for it?", "Scott Donnelly", "So I think there is a fair bit of international interest. We still have a lot of customers that are talking to us. We have had the aircraft dollar of the country. We've had a lot of customers flying it. Really, the next major milestone for us, well, there is really two. One is that, we've had a couple of relatively minor things that we wanted to change in the production configuration of the aircraft. We've completed that engineering work and we're in the manufacturing process right now, building that, what's called the confirming production version of the aircraft. Customers obviously want to fly that and see that before they would place an order. ", "And the other issue for us was always around the airworthiness and how do you get a certification and as I think you've heard publicly, there is now an air force program, there is program office, where they will conduct airworthiness certifications of aircraft that were not funded in development by the air force and so we've already submitted our application in that process. So that's sort of a work in progress as well. So, we think this all kind of dovetails with getting the first confirming article built and ready to fly here in probably early to mid-summer. And the airworthiness program will get underway and the air force ultimately will provide the airworthiness certification of that aircraft, which is a big deal to all of our prospective customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Frank, the corporate expense being $32 million, you said it was due to the share price. Is that though changed at this point you're thinking on corporate expense being around 160 for the year?", "Frank Connor", "No. I stick with the same number, George.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then just to make sure you commented that aftermarket was about 35% of revenues each year, which would imply about 3.5% to 4% growth in the aftermarket?", "Scott Donnelly", "That's probably about right. I'd say low to mid-single digit at this point.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And you had $164 million of acquisitions in the quarter, Scott, maybe if you could just list what they were because you make a couple of small ones and it's hard to keep track of them?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, the principal deals in the quarter were Able Engineering, which we announced, this is a repair and overhaul business that does sort of a mix of both Bell product as well as some fixed wing products, so we acquired that early in the quarter. That\u2019s now integrated into our aviation services network, but it\u2019s providing both work \u2013 actually right now probably more Bell than anything else. So they had a \u2013 company had great relations with a number of our customers that looked at a mix of how they maintain their fleet with a combination of both new parts as well as some parts can be overhauled. We have entered that business through that acquisition with Able and frankly that\u2019s gone very well so far.", "We also acquired in the first quarter a company called ATAC. This is a company that provides tactical training and principally under contract to the US Navy, so supporting our current customers. We fly missions that allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to not utilize their own asset to provide things like touch worthy [ph] training, controller training as well as adversary forces for schools like Top Gun as well as a lot of other aggressor forces to emulate enemy aircraft in exercises conducted by the US Navy and the Marine Corps. I would also as a history doing some work for the air force, there is a number of opportunities out there that we think we continue to grow in that space. It\u2019s a nice augmentation for us until \u2013 in terms of how we address customer both in the US as well as internationally to provide training capability.", "There is also a very small acquisition that we did in the quarter. A lot of the service and support that was done on a true simulation and training platforms in particular. Now, the actual simulator maintenance, which is an important part of the business that had been effectively outsourced for quite some time to a small company that was doing that. We think providing the right level of service support is critical to those products over time and didn\u2019t feel comfortable that we should be dependent on a third-party, so we acquired and it was basically acquiring those people, so that they are now part of the company as opposed to having a third-party conducting that service and support. ", "George Shapiro", "So the M&A impact on aviation at 1.3% that you mentioned in the slides and was that all due to service or the organic service numbers, somewhat less than the 3.5% to 4% I just mentioned? ", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, but again, it\u2019s not a huge number either George, but a little bit smaller. ", "George Shapiro", "Okay, those are my follow-ups. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hey, good morning everyone. The 34 jet deliveries in aviation, if I take out 7 Latitudes, it\u2019s 27 ex-Latitude deliveries and last year, it was 33 total with no Latitude. So there is a six \u2013 a unit decline of 6 units year-over-year ex-Latitude in the legacy business. How should I think about that rate of change, how it run rates through the remaining quarters of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Noah, I think it\u2019s still going to be relatively flattish. I think what you\u2019re seeing there is that the \u2013 in the first quarter, as I said, January and February were pretty slow months with all the stuff going on with the market and what not. But I would say the rate of how the team is doing in terms of sales that certainly picked up in March, through April and we would expect we will continue to pick up a bit through the course of the year. So I don\u2019t think we are viewing it as very different than we originally thought when we guided. ", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. I mean, should I be thinking rough order of magnitude. I had something close to 30 Latitude deliveries, so call that up 15 for the year. If that six run rate, that would be close to 25, giving you a net spread of up 10. Is it in that ballpark or it sort of sounds like you are saying that negative six could improve through the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t think that we can go into that level of granularity at this point. I mean, we are going to be up. I think we might be up a little bit more in Latitudes, but the mix when you get down into M2s and CJ3s and it\u2019s \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be materially different. ", "Frank Connor", "I think Noah, our original guidance in terms of top revenue, we are still on track for that. We still in track to see most of the growth coming from Latitude. And at the end of the day, we expect [indiscernible] be approximately flat plus or minus.", "Noah Poponak", "And I think you said you\u2019d expect the Latitude to be mix - slightly mix negative to the overall segment margin this year. Do you expect that it to be negative or positive to the mix next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think, I'm not ready to do 2017 guidance, I think we\u2019ll - we don't know yet next year on what we\u2019re going to look at in terms of the mix of NetJet versus normal retail sales I think it would be probably premature to talk too much about that.", "Noah Poponak", "Understood it\u2019s - the business is moving around, I just thought maybe on that airplane you might have more visibility further output understood thank you.", "Doug Wilburne", "Alright Greg that concludes our call for the day, thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10 AM Eastern Time today through July 21. You may access the AT&T Teleconference replay system at any time by dialing 1800-475-6701 and answering the access code 373338. International participants dial 320-365-3844.

Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Textron Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Doug Wilburne, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO, and; Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $264 million from last year's second quarter. Income from continuing operations was $0.66 per share, up 10% from $0.60 reported in last year's second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was a $26 million use of cash compared to a positive $106 million cash flow in last year's second quarter.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everybody. Before I discuss our results, I would like to comment on the Bell 525 accident, which occurred on July 6 during developmental test flight and tragically claiming the lives of two Bell pilots. Both pilots were highly regarded individuals, well-respected members of Bell's team and very experienced test pilots. We will miss them greatly and keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.", "We're currently providing assistance to the NTSB in support of the investigation to understand exactly what caused the accident. We've suspended flight test activities on the program until we determine the cause of the accident. In the meantime, we're proceeding with all non-flight related certification and program activities. At this time, we do not have an estimate as to when flight testing might resume or the length of delay in certification or first deliveries. We do remain committed to the Bell 525 program and we'll work to ensure the aircraft will be a safe, reliable and high-performance helicopter.", "Moving to the quarter, revenues were up 8.1%, reflecting our ongoing investments in both new products and acquisitions. Segment revenue was up at Systems, Industrial, and Aviation, while down at Bell consistent with our expectations. At Bell, we delivered 6 V-22s, flat with last year's second quarter, 9 H-1s, up from six units last year, and 24 commercial helicopters, down from 39 a year ago.", "On the commercial side, our new 505 Jet Ranger X continues to generate strong interest in the marketplace and certification activities remain on track to support initial deliveries at the end of this year.", "On the customer service front, during the quarter, we opened a new paint and delivery center in Prague to provide full aircraft completion and delivery capabilities to customers in the region.", "Moving to the military side of the business, during the second quarter, we received an order for an additional V-22 under the current multi-year contract for delivery to the U.S. Air Force, and earlier this week, we also received an order for four additional V-22s for delivery to Japan and we continue to work with the DoD to identify sufficient quantities, both domestically and internationally, to support a third multi-year contract.", "We also continue to make progress on assembling our first V-280 aircraft as we reached an important milestone of mating the wing and nacelles to the aircraft fuselage in late April, bringing us one step closer to our scheduled first flight next year. We displayed our full-scale mockup at Farnborough last week and had significant interest from a large number of international customers.", "Moving to Systems, revenues were up significantly from the first quarter and last year, reflecting international weapons deliveries and higher unmanned aircraft volumes.", "On the TAPV program at TMLS, we're making final preparations with our Canadian customer to begin deliveries next month.", "At our Unmanned Systems business, we received a contract for upgrading an additional 24 Shadow systems, which takes us through the end of 2018 for this program. The Shadow system also reached a major milestone during the quarter achieving 1 million hours of in-service operation.", "Finally, at Systems, earlier this year we acquired a small business located in Newport News, Virginia called Airborne Tactical Advantage Company or ATAC. This business provides tactical flight training and air adversary services to the U.S. Navy, Airforce and Marine Corps using a fleet of 27 fighter and tactical aircraft flown by former U.S. military fighter pilots.", "During the quarter, ATAC was awarded a new contract with U.S. Navy worth up to $43 million over the next year. ATAC is a great fit for the company as it has significant synergies with a number of our businesses and a good growth outlook as we believe the U.S. DoD and foreign militaries will increasingly rely on third parties to provide live airborne threat training services.", "Moving to Industrial, we saw an 8.3% increase in revenues, reflecting growth at Kautex and Specialized Vehicles. At Specialized Vehicles, we began shipping our newest Bad Boy Off Road product, the Stampede 900, a recreational 4 x 4 utility vehicle with unmatched power and unrivaled hauling and storage capacity. We expect the Stampede will contribute to top line growth as this product taps into an entirely new market for this business.", "During the quarter, we also acquired Premier Engineering & Manufacturing, a producer of deicing vehicles for the aviation industry. Premier will be part of our ground and support business, which continues to grow nicely as airlines and airports invest in our infrastructure.", "At Kautex, we continue to see good volume growth, reflecting ongoing adoption of our Selective Catalytic Reduction product lines.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million, while profits were down $7 million. The increase in revenues reflected delivery of 45 jets in the quarter compared to 36 last year and 23 King Airs compared to 30 last year. The increase in jets reflected nine Latitudes, including our first delivery to NetJets. The Latitude continues to do well in the market with superior performance, range, comfort, and operating costs, and customer acceptance has been strong, including sales of fractions by NetJets to their own customers. As a result, NetJets increased their total expected contract requirement from 150 units to 200 units and accelerated their delivery schedule. However, launch pricing for the Latitude has been less than what we had hoped for due to competitive dynamics in this segment of the market, resulting in a lower per plane margin contribution.", "Looking forward, while a large portion of our capacity is currently allocated to NetJets, we continue to see strong end-customer demand, which has translated to improved pricing for second half and next year deliveries. Overall, we believe we're still on track for our Aviation segment profit outlook, although our margins will likely be at the lower end of the range with slightly higher volumes of expected Latitudes.", "Longitude development continues to progress as we mated the wing and nacelles to the aircraft fuselage on our first aircraft in May and powered the electrical distribution systems three weeks later. We're on track for first flight later this summer and the aircraft continues to generate significant interest as customers anticipate its entry into service late next year.", "On the Service front, we opened our newest line maintenance station in Bremen, expanding our support offerings in Germany and throughout Europe.", "Moving to the Scorpion, the program is gaining momentum as we have begun the U.S. DoD accreditation process with this week's signing of a cooperative research and development agreement with United States Air Force. Also, production of the conforming aircraft is nearly complete with first flight expected next month. We believe having the accreditation process underway and the conforming aircraft available for demo flights will help facilitate initial sales of the aircraft.", "Last week at Farnborough, we also announced that we were selected by the team of QinetiQ and Thales to supply Scorpion jets for their bid on the UK's Air Support to Defense Operational Training program should they win the competition.", "To sum up, demand in our end markets has been challenging, but we continue to believe that our new products and recent acquisitions will continue to contribute to overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash for the year.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $328 million, up $22 million from the second quarter of 2015 on a $264 million increase in revenues.", "Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were up $72 million from this period last year, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit was $81 million, down from $88 million a year ago, primarily reflecting an unfavorable impact from the mix of products sold in the period. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than at the end of the first quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $46 million, primarily due to volume and mix. Segment profit decreased $20 million from the second quarter of 2015 reflecting the lower volume and mix.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $165 million, primarily due to higher volumes in our Weapons and Sensors and Unmanned product lines. Segment profit was up $39 million, reflecting the higher volumes and mix.", "Industrial revenues increased $77 million due to higher overall volumes and the impact of acquisitions. Segment profit increased $13 million, reflecting the higher volumes. Finance segment revenues decreased $4 million and profit decreased $3 million.", "Moving below the segment line, corporate expenses were $31 million compared to $33 million last year. Interest expense was $37 million, up $5 million from last year.", "On the tax front, the Internal Revenue Service approved a settlement on July 11 of our 1998 to 2008 tax years. As a result, in the third quarter we expect to record an income tax benefit including the reversal of accrued interest of approximately $315 million, of which approximately $200 million, or $0.74 per share, is attributable to continuing operations. The settlement results in an immaterial net benefit to consolidated cash during the year.", "To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full-year EPS from continuing operations of $2.60 to $2.80 per share exclusive of the tax settlement. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $600 million to $700 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Stacy, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And our first question will go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Scott, I wondered if you could speak to the Aviation margin. I know you talked about last quarter when we did the incremental math, the Longitude R&D being elevated ahead of that first flight. Can you quantify how much of an impact that would have had on the incremental this quarter?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Carter, it did have incremental impact for sure. It wasn't probably quite as significant as it was in the first quarter. I would say probably most importantly from an R&D standpoint, in the first half Aviation had pretty high levels of spending, and that really was largely around getting ready for the Longitude first flights and flight test programs. So we've incurred an awful lot of R&D. So our total year number is still going to be about what we thought it was, but there will be a significant reduction in the second half, just associated with the fact that we're just about complete with the high spending load on the Longitude program.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And on the pricing impact you talked about on Latitude, what gives you the confidence that the pricing improves as you exit this year and into next year?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the fact that we already have a lot of aircraft sold, and so we're looking at actuals in terms of the realized pricing that we're seeing in the second half of the year and going into 2017 versus the pricing that we had realized on the aircraft that were already shipped in the first and second quarter. So there's no change in the NetJet pricing. That's a fixed number through the period. But when you look at retail aircraft sales, whole (12:31) aircraft sales to end customers, what's already in our book is higher in the back half of the year and into 2017 than what we've experienced in the first half of the year.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Just wanted to make sure it was in the backlog. Thanks. I'll let somebody else ask.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wondered on the Aviation side of things. So, I guess, if you look classically, you do have a very healthy second half versus first-half margin ramp. Should we take from your prepared comments that the margins in the back half are flattish year-on-year with the second half of last year in that segment?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, I'm sorry, Julian. I haven't looked, I guess, in the numbers in front of me just in terms of the comparable from 2015 to 2016 on the second half. But, certainly incrementally as we usually see, you can certainly expect better margin rates as we go through the second half of the year versus the first, in part driven by the fact that we normally have higher volumes and we would certainly expect to see that. But, also as I mentioned, we'll have lower R&D spending as well within that segment.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. But you still think you can get to about 8.5% for the year as a whole in Aviation?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thank you. And then on Bell, just very quickly, any color you could provide there on the trends in the commercial side, particularly after market, and I guess there as well, the margins year-to-date running at sort of the low-end of the original full year guide. Should we expect a sort of second half pick up in that?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think we will have a second half pick up. Look, the end markets in the commercial helicopter business remain very challenging. What's most critical for us, obviously, is around our 412s. I think we still have a reasonable line of sight on meeting where we need to be this year on 412s. As I kind of mentioned on the last quarter, we think there's some \u2013 a number of opportunities out there that we're working on, which hopefully will give us some better visibility into the future. But at least in terms of how we think the year will close out at Bell for 2016, I think it'll be consistent with our expectations.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, Scott. Good morning. Just wondering if you could just walk us around the world and talk about demands, generally speaking, across your varied segments in North America and Europe, and then maybe over into the Middle East and Asia?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think if you look to the Aviation business Jason, the U.S. remains, probably, the strongest market. We've seen, particularly, earlier in the year a little bit of an uptick in Europe, which has been encouraging. Obviously, we saw a fair bit of dislocation here everywhere in the world in the last few weeks of the quarter with the whole reaction to Brexit. I don't think any of that is actually fundamental at a macro level with Brexit, but just the upset in the financial markets create a lot of uncertainty which kind of froze things up. But, I think other than that we've seen a bit of a strengthening in Europe. South America is still very difficult. I think there's some opportunities that are starting to show in some places, like Argentina, that are starting to improve modestly, but Brazil, most of the economies down there are still very, very challenged.", "Middle East, there's activity certainly across most of our businesses, but again, it's a challenging environment. The conflict or wars that are going on down there have a lot of the governments fairly distracted and focused on pretty immediate needs as opposed to much in the way of long-term work. But there certainly are opportunities that are in the works.", "That Southeast Asia, frankly, is probably one of the healthiest on the international markets in terms of opportunity. There's \u2013 economies are a little more diversified and are doing okay. China continues to be okay for us. It's not the strength of the growth maybe that it was the past, but it's certainly, generally speaking, solid particularly in the Aviation segment.", "So, automotive, I think our numbers fairly well match what you see going on in the world. The European market actually has been kind of stronger. North America has had general strength, but there's more strength in the larger vehicles, in the trucks and the high end than there are in some of the smaller models, just, I think, reflecting the price of gas. So, I don't think that you were seeing anything, probably, that would surprise you a lot versus just what's going on in general in terms of what GDP looks like in these various regions.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, Scott, you made some comments about conversations with customers on the Longitude. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little flavor for how you think pricing is going to shape up in that, given the fact that we had goalposts moved on us a little bit here on the Latitude? And what kind of customer mix are you expecting here out of the gate on the Longitude? Are we going to be selling into the fractional advantage or is this more directly into customers on a one-off basis?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think at this point we expect it to be primarily just end-use customers on the Longitude. We've had, kind of, our normal customers have been in to Wichita pretty extensively looking at the aircraft. As you may recall, we had a full, not just a mockup, but a full aircraft that we displayed last year, and we kept that aircraft at the plant. We've had lots of people coming in to look at it.", "And with respect to pricing, I think our challenge on Latitude is that our competitor in that space has two aircraft, right. One which is a little bit of the smaller aircraft, which is really what we thought we would end up competing with, with the Latitude. That was sort of our intention. And then they've got a larger aircraft, and those two aircraft have created a pricing problem. And I think our performance and our range, were far superior to the smaller aircraft, which is where we wanted to be, but they're just kind of using the larger aircraft to try to compete with us. And that's really what's generated a lot of the pricing problem.", "When you look at Longitude, that's kind of a combination now where you have the much larger aircraft and, frankly, performance and range that I think will distinguish us very nicely from where the competition is. And so, certainly our expectation is that we have a much better pricing position because we can distance ourselves in terms of the performance and capability of that aircraft, and there's not another aircraft the competitor has sitting on top of that to try to bring down on price to compete with it.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hey. I was surprised that you guys didn't buy any stock in this quarter. And I know at the end of the last quarter you only had about 4.5 million shares left in your authorization. So, can you talk a little bit about, philosophically, how you're dealing with that? And then typically when does the board look at that as to whether you need to expand the buyback?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Sam, we did an awful lot of buying in the first quarter, so we did back off a little bit on the second quarter. But I wouldn't attribute it to the share shelf that's sitting there. We still do have 4.5 or so million available under that. But if we thought it was the right thing to do, we've had these discussions with the board, and there'd be no problem going back and extending that authorization. So it's just \u2013 we haven't officially taken that action because we still have enough that's available to exercise under the previous authorizations that we haven't taken up formal board action. But, obviously, there would have to be a discussion with the board. We have had preliminary discussions, and I wouldn't expect that that would be an issue.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then on the Aviation side, the $120 million or so increase in the backlog, is that driven by any particular products or any way to look into that and say, there's a trend there?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we're trying, Sam, not to go model by model in terms of backlog. But it would be a pretty safe assumption that Latitude is driving the bulk of that.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Scott, I don't know how far or deep you'll go, but I just wanted to stay on that last question, if possible. It would be really helpful to be able to understand. We see the headline backlog in the headline book-to-bill being better in the quarter. It'd be great to understand how much of that is NetJets Latitude aircraft folding into the backlog, as you've said, you'll do it carefully, versus something at Beech versus just pure underlying regular old business jet?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, no. Again, I don't think we want to get into the specifics on a model by model basis when we haven't done that in quite some time. But, look, I think it's not just NetJet. I think we've been pretty open about the fact that Latitude is selling well. And our expectations for the year was that the overall market would be generally fairly flattish from last year in terms of most of the model types, and most of the growth would be driven by the big new product introduction, which in this case this year is Latitude. And so I think that expectation is kind of what we're seeing.", "We are seeing good demand on the Latitude, both on the NetJet as well as on the retail side. And other models are selling fine; they're selling consistent with how we expected. Some models are stronger than others, but in general, the volume on the jet side is what we expected and the thing that's driving the upside in terms of growth on a year-over-year basis. And then we would continue to expect to see that as we roll into next year is based on Latitude. And so the bulk of that increase in backlog, I would say, is going to be attributed to that, both NetJet and retail sales.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. I understand the desire to not get into specific aircraft, but just the NetJet situation alone is pretty unique. And if there were zero NetJets brought into backlog versus if there were 15 to 20, it's a difference between a book-to-bill of 1.1 and of 0.8. It just kind of makes a big difference. I don't know if you guys would consider breaking that out today or in the future or whatever. But...", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Look, Noah, we're not trying to do this on purpose. This is (23:23) competitively very important, I think. I think our competitors and whatnot would love to know which aircraft have what kind of backlog. And I, we can give you guys the absolute number. We can give you the color around sort of where it's going, but I don't think I need to damage the business by providing my competitors a lot of information on where we stand on sales of which aircraft.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. I understand. What's your sense, Scott, of why market-wide used inventory is now back on an upward trend in business jet?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, on a personal note, in total, it is. For the numbers, I'm sure I read all the stuff that you guys read, but there's an awful lot of mix down within that, right? I would say that if you look at our aircraft and, particularly, in that light mid-size, it's been relatively stable. And, frankly, the market's healthy. So the amount of turn, the number of sales that are going on has been fine. So when we look at the amount of used aircraft sales that we had in a quarter versus the previous quarter, it's up. We see the number of transactions that are in our space, involving our aircraft seem to be doing fine. And we see relatively stable residual values. So there's different dynamics, obviously, in terms of what sizes of aircraft and there are different markets. Right? I mean, the heavy iron market behaves differently than the light jet market. So actually for us and for our customers that are looking to sell used aircraft, buy used aircraft, it's been pretty stable, both pricing and volume.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Noah, just to be clear, the availability of used Citations is not up on a percentage basis. It's down slightly from where it was at the first quarter.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. And that's kind of what I'm saying. There's just a lot of variability from aircraft model by model, sizes of aircraft, that you really have to go through all the details. But I think in the Citation side, we haven't seen much change. It looks fine.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Just finally, then, with all of that and everything today, and it being a little more than halfway through this year, where would you pin the likelihood of up versus flat versus down Cessna production next year?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, I'm probably not quite ready to do 2017 yet, Noah. But, we certainly feel like, our view has been generally that markets are fairly flat, but new products matter. And that's what we saw last year, that's what we're seeing this year. We're not ready to do 2017 guidance. Obviously, we still feel very good about where the Latitude is in the market and its trend in terms of its demand. And obviously as we get into next year, we'll hit Longitude towards the latter part of the year. So I think that'll help us as well. But, again, I think that'll be positive. Longitude will be positive. Latitude will be positive. It's too early to make a call on just the base market, I guess.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Are you on mute, George?", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Good morning.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Scott, I wanted to try and pin you down a little bit more on R&D. It was up $11 million, I think, in the first quarter. You said it was up less this quarter, though I kind of figured maybe $5 million. And then do we get a $5 million or $10 million drop in each of the subsequent quarters for the rest of the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's about right, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Pardon?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's about right.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And then, Frank, what was the aftermarket growth in the Aviation sector?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "It was good. It was kind of high single digits type year-over-year.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "So that's a step up from what we've been seeing as more mid-single digits in the prior quarters?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we also had \u2013 I think we were healthy on our historic organic side of the business, and of course we also have Able, which is in the Aviation Services business, which is still coming in as an M&A transaction on a year-over-year basis. And that business is doing well.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And the weaker King Airs in the quarter, Scott, is that just how it fell in the quarter? Or are you seeing impact from oil affecting King Air demand?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean, there's a little bit of that, George. I'm not sure that it's just specifically oil and gas. But the King Air has had a strong international marketplace, is a big part of that business, and it's a good part of the business. And it has certainly been a little bit weaker in the first half of the year. And we've, obviously, made some accommodation for that and think it'll be a little bit weaker than we'd like it to be. But again, I think that's mostly driven by a lot of international markets that are just a little softer right now.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "And lastly, you mentioned talking about pricing up across the product line. Is that pretty much across all the products? Is it more the lower end products versus the higher end? Wonder if you can expand a little bit more on that.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Our product pricing in general, George, has been pretty flat. There's been a couple of models where we've seen a little bit of price. There are a couple of models that are a little bit \u2013 at any rate, they're really very small variances on a year-over-year basis or quarter-to-quarter basis. So I would say right now pricing by and large is fairly stable on most of the models.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. But you commented that pricing's better in the second half of the year...", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, specifically the Latitude. Yeah, the Latitude is the one that as we work into the second half of the year we're seeing increased price that's already largely booked on that product line. So there has definitely been a positive pricing trend on Latitude.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Doug, you're sounding awfully happy this morning. It must be because you're retiring. So congratulations on that.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Myles, and that would be one factor.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So could you touch on the pricing comment you made, Scott, with respect to the second half of this year and into next year? You're not carrying much of a backlog. So how much visibility do you actually have on pricing into 2017?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think, obviously, it's mixed across the model. The one that we're largely commenting around where we feel like we've seen some nice positive momentum on the pricing side is specific around Latitude. And that product is pretty well spoken for at this point.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Outside of the NetJet. So from individual buyers, you have pretty good visibility into 2017?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. Certainly through the balance of this year and just starting now as we're selling into 2017.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then as we look at the Systems margins, obviously, really good performance there. Were there any positive adjustments outside of just pure mix?", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations", "We had a small EAC (30:50), but it wasn't major.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Not material relative to what we normally see.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. No. It's primarily driven by the fact that, as you guys know, the Weapons and Sensors business has a tendency to be sort of lumpy, right, because we build at a relatively stable level. But lot acceptance is typical with a lot of international customers. So a lot of the positive margins are the fact that we had significant uptick in volume in the quarter.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And good execution performance by the team in terms of getting it done and doing it productively.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And the only other one. So just a run rate cleanup on interest expense, the tick there up. Is that the new run rate? Or is $133 million still a good planning number for the year?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "$135 million-ish type number for the year.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Sounds good. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much, and good morning. Just to follow up on Systems with the small acquisition that you mentioned there, the strong margin in the quarter. Can you quantify what the acquisition contributed? And would you say that your expectation for sales and EBIT there is higher than it was at the beginning of the year?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The acquisition didn't play a whole lot into this thing. As you would expect in the initial year of a deal like that, there's step-up. There's the normal accounting for shares. So I would say it's relatively neutral impact on 2016. And we certainly expect it to be a nice accretive contributor in 2017 and on.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay. And then with regard to cash flow, you told us in the past to expect the cash flow to be fairly back half weighted. Could you, is there any way to calibrate our expectations? There's a lot of cash coming in in the second half to calibrate our expectations for Q3 versus Q4?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not sure we want to get into a quarter-by-quarter, but we certainly still feel confident with the numbers that we provided in terms of the overall year guidance. We've talked in the past. We know we have a headwind associated with customer deposits, largely the military payments that are unwinding through the course of the year. So those have been unwinding as we've gone through the first half of the year, and generally speaking for us, will serve to offset an awful lot of that in Q3 and Q4 as we see working capital reductions and a loss of inventory through volume, largely in Aviation and Bell as we go through the balance of the year. And TAPV, of course, which remember, we don't start deliveries of those units here until August. So that's a fair bit of inventory that we've been carrying that we'll see a significant reduction in Q3 and Q4.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And we're obviously always seasonally stronger in Q4, if you just look historically given the volumes that we see in Q4.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Thank you very much.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go now to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Just on Bell profitability in terms of margins going forward, does it remain at about a 10% rate if we assume commercial helicopters doesn't recover for some time?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Sheila, that's what we've talked about is probably being in that 10% to 11% range. And an awful lot of that will have to do with where we are as usual on the commercial side on 412s. Again, I think we feel pretty good about where we are for 2016. And we'll have a lot more visibility as we get to the end of the year to be able to provide guidance on where we think that will be in 2017. But at least so far, for this year, we'll finish where we expect to be.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Got it. And then just one on the broader military opportunity set, if you could talk about that a little bit, whether it's the V-22 or the Scorpion both domestically and internationally, and how you think about the programs and opportunities there?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the V-22, obviously, has made some progress with the Japanese deal. And those orders now are firming up and coming in, being exercised either under the multi-year two contract or as some of the potential volume in a multi-year three deal. There continue to be a number of conversations with international customers that are going on. I certainly still think that Israel is a potential. That was talked about for quite a while and sort of moved out. And there's still uncertainty around that, but I think there are still conversations going on which are, at this point, very much government to government. The same is true with a couple of other countries, and so those are things, however, that would all be talked about in the context of a multi-year three. So it's not something that's going to hit here in the next couple of years. The only ones we'll see really will probably be Japan in that near term. So there's certainly a lot of other discussion and opportunities, dialogue, going on, some which is public, some which is not, around H-1s.", "The H-1 is performing fabulously for the Marine Corps. It's both the utility and the attack versions of that are in the quote process and proposal processes for several potential international applications. So we'll be following that pretty closely.", "Scorpion is still very much a wild card. It was a huge milestone for us to have the Air Force sign up to do the accreditation program. That just happened this past week. We've had, as you know, a number of international customers that have been looking at the aircraft. And there really have been two issues for them. One is, how are you going to get this thing certified so that they can provide their certification on top of it. And not unreasonably, customers want to fly the production fully conforming aircraft. We have the accreditation path checked off, and here in the next month or so, we'll be flying the first production configured aircraft. So, our customers are already talking about when they're going to be able to come in and get a chance to fly the aircraft. So two big milestones, boxes that we needed to check to get done before we can proceed with final sales of the aircraft.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "And just on the Scorpion, do you think international or domestic order is more likely?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, international has always been the focus of the aircraft for sure. And so those are the deals that we've been pursuing and working and staying close to those customers for a while. Look, I think there is U.S. opportunity at some point. I think, and there's been some papers here written recently. The Air Force is sort of facing into the reality in the U.S. that cost matters and they need more aircraft that guys can fly and build hours. And frankly, a lot of missions that can be executed that don't need to have very, very, very high end fighter capability. But those requirements I think are still in early formative stages within the U.S. And so I think we'll see how that plays out here over the next year or two.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Ok. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Good morning, guys. A couple quick program questions. Scott, on the T-6, you guys have delivered about 22 year-to-date. I'm wondering if you're thinking you'll hit 40 for the full year, because that would make it kind of flat year-over-year. And I was actually thinking it would trend down, because I think U.S. deliveries are over. So just wondering what your thoughts are on that program going forward.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Pete, I think it will be fairly flat for the year. The U.S. program is winding down. But we've had a couple of international programs that we won which will fill out the year. So I think 2016 feels fairly solid, and deliveries will be exactly where we expected them to be.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Okay. And then just last one for me. Sensor Fuzed Weapon, I think there was some news in the quarter that the State Department was actually considering blocking a sale to Saudi. I was wondering if you heard the same thing, what your thoughts were, if that's real or not. And I know this is a lumpy program, but I think Saudi was one of the meaningful customers. So just to raise a question in my mind there.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, they're not a current customer. They're a prospective customer for sure. They have been a customer in the past. But basically, Pete, you're right. There's a lot of issues going on between the State Department, NSC, and what's going on over the Middle East, and that is certainly, as a minimum, delaying getting approvals. Whether that breaks loose and ultimately is approved or whether it's not is still to be determined. But there's certainly an interest on their part. It's been notified to Congress in the past. It was approved through that notification process, but now going back through and getting the approvals through State, it is hung up at this point.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Mr. Bergner, your line is open. And we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. And, Doug, too young a man to retire. So you guys had very nice results at Systems, and that's even without any shipments of TAPV that come here, in here in the second half. On paper, it looks like Systems might have some upside. Is that a potential?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know, Cai. It's probably too early to say one or the other. You know that the SFW side, in particular, can be kind of lumpy just because of the way those deliveries happen. It was a very strong quarter for that business. TAPV will certainly kick in here in Q3 and Q4 as we expected that it would. But, again, it is built into our plan. Right? We did expect the TAPVs to be Q3 and Q4. So it was a very good quarter for that team. I think they're going to deliver a very solid year. But right now, my expectation is it'll be consistent with what we guided.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then alternatively, when you look at Bell, you had a very strong military shipment in the first half, and that looks like it's going to be weaker in the second half. And commercial, again, was weak in the first half. Has to get better in the second half to kind of get you home. My understanding was that commercial margins were lower than military margins, so is there much risk at Bell that, that mix that you come in at the low-end or a little below it?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean, the mix is different even in the commercial world, model by model, Cai. I think that our military margins are solid and will stay that way through the balance of the year. I mean, we're delivering the same V-22s and H-1s that we delivered in the first half. So I think that business is in good shape and they'll deliver to our expectations. I do think we'll be lighter on some of the commercial volume and total number than we would've expected at the beginning of the year. But it's largely in a lot of the lighter helicopters, which on the initial equipment sale is not as material to the business as others.", "Now those aircraft, of course, turn into a lot of service opportunities. So I mean, net, the margins in the commercial side are still good because of all the service that those aircraft pull through with them. But to be light in terms of volume on some of the lighter aircraft will not have a meaningful impact within the year. In the end it all comes down, largely, to the larger aircraft, and particularly the 412s, and I think we're on track to do that. And those are more heavily laid into the back half of the year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then switching to Aviation, so you mentioned the better pricing for Latitude in the second half. Talk to us a bit about the productivity. Does the profitability improve? Because presumably you're coming down the learning curve as time goes by. So should we expect the profitability of Latitude to improve going forward?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I mean, I...", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I think that in general it will. There's always a little bit of startup cost and variances and whatnot in the early model years. The team has done a nice job on cost, frankly. The aircraft is coming in around the cost where we expected it to be. Is there still some benefit to be had? Certainly. And especially since we have, for the first time in a long time, a fairly significant volume of aircraft, which are to the same configuration, that being NetJets, obviously, which will help. So obviously the guys in the factory are focused on that and trying to drive some incremental productivity and efficiency around that. So we'll see some benefit from that. And I think in part, that'll help us with some of our margin rates as we go into the back half of the year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then could you conjecture, when you look at the Longitude, when in the second half it might deliver? Does it look like it's very late in the year or could really have any sort of meaningful impact in terms of next year?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's largely going to be a fourth quarter issue, Cai. I don't know that we really want to guide too much on it, yet. We're still \u2013 we haven't started the flight test program yet. We still have to go through the certification progress with the FAA. So having not yet started flight test, it's probably a little bit early to get a sense of where we are in that process and what the exact schedule will come out to be, but it's easily a year flight test program, right? So you're talking about something that would probably be, best case, late third quarter, probably into fourth quarter.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Well, that's why I ask, because when do you expect to fly? Because usually I would expect to take at least a year to kind of get the thing certified. So there would be some risk that it might slip out of 2017?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There is some risk to that, of course. But, again, Cai, we're thinking we're going to be flying here in the next couple of months. So a year flight test program, that kind of puts you at the end of third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter, and as you know, we've been able on other models and programs to get certifications done in that kind of a timeframe and make some deliveries shortly thereafter.", "So there is still \u2013 there's certainly a reasonable probability that we'll see fourth quarter sales of Longitude next year. Worst case, there's a few month delay, then for sure it could roll into the beginning of 2018, but again, we'll know an awful lot more when we get around to really doing 2017 guidance because we'll be months into flight test and have a better feeling for where we are.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Good morning, guys. I'm sorry about not being there when I was first in the queue earlier.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No problem.", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Two quick questions. First, on this tax impact, will there ultimately be a benefit to Textron from a cash point of view related to this $315 million, and $0.74 from continuing operations?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "There will be a little bit of cash inflow associated with it, but it's not material, as we said in the comments. I think obviously the big cash impact is that the avoidance of kind of paying what we had accrued on the books here, obviously, which we always expected, but had the reserves for over a substantial period of time. But there will be some cash inflow associated with it, but it's not material.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Great. And I know the call hasn't focused as much on Bell, but are you seeing a bottoming in the commercial rotorcraft market, or are you still seeing incremental weakness as you look out to the second half of the year?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know. It's very hard to say, I certainly hope it's a bottom. It's pretty tough out there.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. What sort of are you looking for on the Bell side to get more confident that you've reached a bottom on the commercial side?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, obviously, not to be too simplistic about it, but orders, right? We're talking to a lot of our customers, obviously, and we have a sense of where they are. Oil and gas obviously remains very difficult, right? You've got, some of these guys are in bankruptcy. You've got a lot of their fleet that's sitting on the ground. They're just not being utilized. Now the oil and gas cycle is in all likelihood exactly that, a cycle, right?", "So we've seen a rebounding of the price of oil, but not back to where it probably needs to be for them to feel better. It's starting to probably impact possibly in some regions of the world where $50 or so is \u2013 you can extract and be profitable at that. There's certainly other parts of the world where it needs to be significantly higher than that to make them feel like that end customers going to start getting stronger.", "And of course a lot of these economies \u2013 they're just oil and gas petrodollar-based. So their economies will get healthier as that price per barrel rebounds, but we don't really have a great sense at this point what that lag is between where those rebounds and pricing and how quickly that'll flow through to having the ability to invest in their fleets or in general in those economies for people to feel comfortable to start laying out the funding for significant CapEx kind of projects.", "But anyway, I wish I had a very prudent answer for you, but we talk to customers every day. Our team's out there working it. We kind of know pretty much every opportunity in the world that's out there. It's just a matter of seeing some of the stuff start to convert to orders. And it's been soft.", "I mean, you see that in the volumes in the quarter, and I'd be misleading if I thought it was going to, all of a sudden, materially improve to affect the second half of this year, which is why I would say I would expect unit volumes to be down sort of from where we would've expected them to be, but not with significant financial impact for the year. Again, in terms of how we look out any further than that, that's something we'll have to work on and factor that into how we guide for 2017. And that will depend a lot on just sort of the general outlook of what those conversations are like for customers and, in particular, a number of opportunities out there that are fairly significant that will materialize or not between now and the end of the year.", "Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions and for that perspective on the helicopter market.", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. No problem.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. I wanted to get back onto congratulate Doug, publicly, on his retirement, first and foremost. And then secondly, Scott, just ask you to offer up some perspective on the M&A pipeline at this point in cash deployment going forward?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say on the M&A front, most of what we've done this year have been relatively small add-on transactions. And I think that's something that we continue to look at. There's a number there in the pipeline that are relatively small. We like doing those deals. In general, they've been attractive for us. They've played out very well in terms of returns and financials as they built into the business. And so our expectations is that's probably how things will continue to play out through the balance of the year. There's always stuff we're looking at, but at this point, there's nothing out there that's of any materiality that's something I would say, hey, guys, here's something we're looking at or doing. But we have a number of things that we're always looking at and whether one of those could happen in the balance of the year or not is still to be determined.", "In general, our capital allocation strategy is, kind of, unchanged. We reserve and kind of target a certain amount of our allocation to M&A. But again, it's all totally opportunistic. Right? If it's the right kind of deals and we think it's good, we'll do them. If we don't, then obviously we don't do them. So...", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes, just a couple of quick ones. On the Sovereign, we've seen the deliveries get pretty low. I mean, is it really just getting cannibalized from the Latitude? And kind of what's your outlook for the Sovereign?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So there is certainly some cannibalization, George, between the Sovereign Plus and the Latitude. The aircrafts are similar in some respects. I mean, it's really a trade-off between the size of the cabin versus the number of passengers and range. So if you are looking and your requirement is to do a little bit of a longer haul and you need to put more packs on board, then the Sovereign's a great airplane, and that's why we still sell them. And we have a number of customers that still looking at acquiring the Sovereign because it's great for that mission and it continues to be a great aircraft in that area.", "If you don't quite need the range and you don't quite need the number of passengers, but you want to go with that larger cabin, then the Latitude's a great choice. And I think what you're seeing is that we have a fair number of customers that will give up a few hundred nautical miles and don't need to have the higher passenger count, and they'll err on the side of the Latitude.", "So from our perspective, they're both selling. Certainly, with the Latitude being new, it is generating a little bit more demand, which was exactly what we expected. And certainly some of those customers, if you went back two years ago, may have been people that would've bought a Latitude. But it's good having them both in the portfolio. It gives us the ability to work with the customer and say, what's your mission, and which one fits your mission better? And that's kind of where we're continuing to sell.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And on the A-10, Scott, you're still figuring that, that's kind of 6 to 10 a year in terms of the demand there?", "Scott C. Donnelly - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think the A-10, with just the market dynamic out there, George, is just a relatively thin market. It's a great aircraft. We still have customers that absolutely love the airplane. So we still see some demand, but it's going to be a small number.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And then one quick one for you, Frank. Kautex, I don't think they have a huge amount of exposure to the UK. But with the devaluation of the pound happening towards the end of the quarter probably didn't have a big impact this quarter. How much of an impact do you look for in the third quarter?", "Frank T. Connor - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, there's a little bit of an impact, George, but it's not that material on an overall basis. It will be a little bit of headwind, but not that much.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much again.", "Douglas R. Wilburne - Vice President-Investor Relations", "All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call. And for me, it concludes my 65th earnings call. So I want to say thank you to all you fine analysts and investors and a shout out to one person who has listened to 65 of these, and that would be my wife, Becky. So all the best.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This conference will be available for replay after 10:00 a.m. today running through October 19 till midnight.

Welcome to the Textron Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Eric Salander, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Eric Salander", "Thanks, Stacy, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today's press release.", "On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron's revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion up $71 million from last year's third quarter. During this year's third quarter, we record $115 million pretax charge or $0.27 per share after tax related to the restructuring plan we announced this past summer. We also recorded a tax benefit of $0.76 per share related to a settlement of U.S. Internal Revenue Service audits", "Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.61 per share down $0.02 from last year's third quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $94 million compared to $116 million in last year's third quarter.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks Eric and good morning everybody. 2.2% increase in third quarter revenues reflected growth of Industrial and Aviation. We had good execution in the quarter with margin improvements in our Systems and Bell businesses. Despite the increase in revenues adjusted earnings per share was down $0.02 primarily the result of higher corporate expenses which reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and higher spending on the Scorpion program.", "The Bell revenues were down slightly as lower commercial units delivery in the quarter more than offset higher military volumes. Specifically we delivered 25 commercial helicopters down from 45 in last year's third quarter. We delivered 6 V-22, up from four units last year and 8 H-1s up from 5 last year.", "Our V-247 Valor program continues to progress with assembly of the first aircraft approximately two-thirds complete and on track for first flight next year. We also announced a new military tiltrotor product the Bell V-247 Vigilant. The Bell V-247 Vigilant is a Group 5 unmanned aerial system that will leverage the investment we're making in the V-280 platform.", "247 design will provide unmatched speed, payload long-endurance capabilities and runway independence to fill multitude of missions including maritime environments. At the AUSA show over this month customer interest was high around both our V-280 mockup and the Bell V-247 model that were on display.", "On the commercial side while deliveries were down significantly in the quarter, we saw an increase in order flow. As we consider current customer activity and contract opportunities, we believe that Bell commercial helicopter demand has stabilized and maybe in the early stages of recover.", "On our new 505 Jet Ranger X, we continue to make progress on certification and we expect to achieve this initial certification late this year with deliveries beginning shortly thereafter. During the quarter we were awarded two FMS contracts for 13 V-2 helicopters to be delivered in Uganda and Kenya with deliveries beginning in the fourth quarter. Overall given the challenging commercial markets, we had a strong quarter at Bell as cost productivity efforts over the past several years contributed to a 13% segment margin.", "Moving to Systems, revenues were down as higher revenues at Marine and Land Systems were more than offset by lower weapons deliveries. As you know we announced we will be discontinuing production of Sensor Fuzed Weapons in March of next year. As result we're taking actions now to reduce costs across the System segment.", "At TMLS we began initial TAPV deliveries to our Canadian customer in the quarter and looking to the fourth quarter we have a significant wrap in deliveries although slower than we had originally planned.", "Moving to industrial, we saw some percent increase in revenues reflecting the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes in our automotive and specialized vehicle businesses. Last month we announced we will be consolidating Jacobsen with a specialized vehicle business to optimize efficiency and better serve the company's shared customers and distributors.", "Also in the vehicle business we recently acquired Safeaero, a Swedish Manufacturer of De-Icer for the commercial aviation industry. Safeaero will be part of our ground support equipment portfolio which continues to grow very nicely.", "In our commercial business we introduced a new line of Cushman Hauler utility vehicles. While on our consumer product line, our distributors kicked off retail sales of our new Stampede 4x4 off road product. At Kautex our selective catalytic reduction product lines continue to drive growth above the current auto market.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were up $39 million in the quarter. We delivered 41 Jets compared to 37 last year and 29 King Airs flat with last year. On the new product front, the launch tube made its first flight on October 8, marking an important achievement in its part certification market entry. This first flight occurred less than a year after unveiling the launch tube at NBAA last November demonstrating our rapid new product development cycle with target certification later next year.", "Customer anticipation to new aircraft remains strong as we have begun executing purchase agreements with potential customers. During the quarter we also unveiled Cessna Denali, our new clean sheets single-engine pressurized turboprop. The Denali will feature superior operating performance with the only flat floor cabin design in its class and will easily convert between passenger and cargo configurations.", "We are not currently serving this market segment and believe the highly differentiated Denali will contribute a significant future growth of aviation with its best-in-class performance characteristics.", "Moving to Scorpion, the program continues to make good progress and we expect first flight of our initial production aircraft very soon. Last week we conducted a successful weapons testing with our existing aircraft at U.S. Air Force White Sands Proving Ground. With accreditation process now underway and customer interest increasing, we have accelerated investment in the program. We have begun building several aircraft to support the accreditation requirements, validate our manufacturing process, expand our marketing and customer engagement activities.", "Moving to an update on our restructuring plan, we have announced additional headcount reductions across our businesses principally through a voluntary separation plan in our aviation segment and have increased our cost estimate accordingly. To wrap-up, several of our end markets remain challenging in the third quarter, we still achieve top line growth while furthering our development efforts on major new programs.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor ", "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million down $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 on a $71 million increase in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation.", "At Textron Aviation revenues were up 39 $million from this period last year primarily due to higher pre-owned aircraft volumes and the impact of an acquisition. Segment profit was $100 million down from $107 million a year ago primarily reflecting the mix of products sold. Backlog in this segment ended the quarter at $1.1 billion approximately flat with second quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were down $22 million primarily due to lower commercial deliveries partially offset by higher military volumes. Segment profit decreased $2 million from the third quarter of 2015 reflecting the lower commercial aircraft deliveries. Backlog in this segment was $4.9 billion at the end of the quarter approximately flat with the second quarter.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were down $7 million primarily due to lower weapons volume partially offset by higher revenues at Marine and Land. Segment profit was up $5 million reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $2.2 billion down $74 million from the end of the second quarter.", "Industrial revenues increased $58 million due to the impact of acquired businesses and higher volumes. Segment profit increased $5 million reflecting improved performance. Finance segment revenues increased $3 million and profit decreased $3 million.", "Moving below the segment profit, corporate expenses were $53 million compared to $27 million last year. As Scott explained, this reflected higher stock-based compensation expense and the accelerated spending on our Scorpion program.", "Interest expense was $35 million up $2 million from last year. With respect to our restructuring plan in the quarter, we recorded a pretax charges of $115 million on the special charges line. Looking forward our revised cost estimate for the total restructuring plan is now a range of $140 to $170 million pretax up from $110 million to $140 million to reflect the additional reductions that Scott discussed.", "Cash outlays associated with this plan are now estimated to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million compared to our previous estimate of $65 million to $85 million. We recorded a total income tax benefit of $319 million in the quarter related to settlement of U.S. IRS audits for years 1998 through 2008, $206 million or $0.76 per share was attributable to continuing operations.", "To wrap up, we are narrowing our adjusted full year EPS from continuing operations guidance to $2.65 to $2.75 a share which corresponds to GAAP EPS of $3.06 to $3.21 per share. Given our accelerated spending on Scorpion, higher investment in restructuring and slower TAPV deliveries we are revising our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group for pension contributions to $500 million to $600 million down from our previous estimate of $600 million to $700 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So Stacy we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Gavin Parsons", "This is Gavin on for Noah. Just looking at the broader business jet market, it seems like it's weakened a little bit lately, with some of your competitors announcing production rate cuts over the last couple of quarters. And then you look at deliveries ex-Latitude, mostly flat, with a little bit worse mix. So I'm curious if somewhat on the cannibalization subject, what do deliveries look like ex-Latitude for the next couple of years, and is there pricing pressure in the market more broadly, in addition to these new model introductions you have lined up?", "Scott Donnelly", "Gavin I\u2019m not sure I would try to harbor guess at the next few years on what the market looks like but I think that where the market is right now is certainly still soft. I would say it's still more or less in line with what we expected this year which is to say that, most of the growth is driven by the new products that are coming on to the market that's certainly been true with latitude.", "The market for historical products is pretty flat and yes, there continues to be a pretty tight market it's difficult to get any kind of pricing but you know it's up little on some models and down little on some model so it's really is consistent with what we've been seeing for the last couple of years.", "So our plan obviously is that the only growth that we've been seeing is been driven by the new products come out into the marketplace and that's why we continue to stay focused on bringing longitude to the market and bring the knowledge of the market, ultimately bringing the hemisphere to the market because I think at least in the market environment we exist in today that's the only way to drive growth, and you continue to expect at the legacy historical product lines will be relatively flat.", "Gavin Parsons", "Thanks. And when you look at -- could you try to size maybe the net impact of membership clubs? Kind of Uber for business jet, if you will, where that's much higher utilization, but it's bringing in new users who potentially hadn't had access to business jets before?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I don't know when I go all the way to the Uber side, I mean obviously we have a couple of very important customers that are in the - sort of nonretail only aircraft market niche as you know to the extent there obviously selling these aircraft to fractional customers and their car based on the niche as a pretty broad range of product that they provide to reach people aren't owning their own whole aircraft.", "So that's an important part of where we today with Latitudes. Obviously on the King Air side, you have guys out there like Wheels Up that are operating primarily King Airs and also aimed at a non-equity and a broader base of potential customer.", "So we see some of that. I mean these are very real customers. They are taking over aircraft and are running pretty significant businesses today and appear to be doing so successfully. How much broader we see that market or how far that reaches to what customer segments in the world, I think is still to be determined. It's a lot of different models out there, some of them I think are on the work and there is other ones that may not work but certainly we have a couple of key customers that are sort of inline with I think your question. How do you reach a broader base of people to get into a private aircraft and today we certainly see that happening very successfully with both the NetJets of the world as well as the Wheels Up for the world.", "Gavin Parsons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland", "Hi, good morning guys. Just a quick clarification on the Scorpion comment. I think earlier in your prepared remarks, you said higher spending, and then in most of the other places, you said accelerated spending. I just want to clarify, is there any cost growth in the manufacturing efforts early on, or is this all related to pulling forward investment that you intended to do further down the line?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, the increased spending is in R&D expense right, so we\u2019re in the process of getting ready for our first flight. We\u2019ve also undertaken some things like going out and doing actual weapons, deliveries so the cost of those kinds of activities obviously a lot of the cost is around bringing the first production unit to the market and developing our manufacturing processes as we start sort of what I referred to is a limited rate production run, our expenses that we would accelerate.", "So these are things that, that certainly could have been put off and originally would have been done in the future but I think as we\u2019ve established this with the Air Force and now have a path of certification, the level of activity where customers has stepped up considerably and it\u2019s the right time for us to step up and demonstrate this aircraft and its performance capability and get much more aggressive about the marketing and test flights and I think it\u2019s the right time based on what\u2019s going on in the customer community to really mature this program.", "And so those are largely expenses that we pull forward because we think, we need to do it now. Waiting a year or spreading it out over longer period of time won't help us given the opportunities that we see out there in the - not too distant future.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay. Great. That's great color. And then on the comment you made regarding demand stabilization and potential recovery at Bell, I wondered if you might give us a little bit more color there, and what's driving that view? Is it customer pipeline and conversations? Obviously, the backlog was flat year over year, or sequentially. Any more color on that would be helpful.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, I think in the last quarter, we have seen a pretty significant uptick in the numbers of orders that we booked compared to the first half of the year. Now this is still down from where it wasn\u2019t in its peak. I mean we\u2019re not suggesting that this market has recovered and things are great but we had a year were order activity was extraordinarily weak.", "And so we're starting now to see customers that are coming forward actually signing deals and closing contracts and in particular there is a number of campaigns that are in process. We're go out there activities happening and clearly deals are going to close. So that's the rational for sort of our color on that. We're coming out of a year or so here, very, very difficult environment in terms of closing any deals.", "I think in the last quarter we saw lot of deals closed and lot of deals that are active in progress. So, it's - again it's not were things were in the great days but it's certainly positive to see and uptick and activity in actual orders.", "Carter Copeland", "Great, thanks for the color. I will let somebody else ask.", "Operator", "We'll go to line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Yes. Good morning Scott. The aviation margin was somewhat lower than what I was looking for. On the second quarter, you said that you would see lower R&D on the Longitude in the third -- in the second half of the year, and pricing may be a little bit better. So could you just comment on that? And then also, to get to the low end of your 8.5% to 9% margin would require a margin north of 11% in the fourth quarter. So is that doable? And if not, what would you suggest is the range now?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well so a couple of things, George first of all the R&D as we went from Q2 to Q3 did come down in the business and I think if you look at the sequential margins are pretty good from Q2 to Q3. But if you look on a year-over-year basis, there is no question that the leverage wasn't there. I\u2019d say the most of that is a result of the fact that our revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was largely driven by used aircraft sales and the inclusion of our acquisition at Able, which is a great little business but in its first year with deal related costs and step up and all that kind of stuff its first year is kind of a breakeven.", "So if you look at that model you have $50 million plus of revenue in there that\u2019s not, there has no margins its used aircraft in the first year of that deal. So, that\u2019s the bulk of where you don\u2019t have leverage where you would probably have expected to see some of that leverage and the rest of its still is ongoing mix issue. So we did have positive pricing on the retail side on latitude in the quarter but it's still at lower margin rates than what we typically see in the rest of our portfolio.", "And obviously all of the mix shift in the quarter as we\u2019ll mentioned you guys see the numbers in terms of aircraft, we had a couple more Mustangs. We had a couple more in M2s, we certainly had more Latitudes but we also were down a couple XLSs and Sovereigns. So from a mix standpoint that certainly pressured some of the conversation as well on a year-over-year basis.", "George Shapiro", "And what would you suggest now for margin for the year, where you had been at 8.5% to 9%?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look I think that\u2019s going to be at the low end of that George and part of the rational for a large driver for the rational for why you see us narrowing our range is that the top end of our original guidance range would have been stronger year in the business jet market. Obviously its continued to be pretty flat, so we're probably going to be more towards that midpoint which is why we\u2019re revised our guidance.", "As it comes to the segment, I think we\u2019re probably expecting something more around a 10% kind of margin rate in the quarter for Aviation as oppose to something that would be high enough to bring it up into the midpoint of its range.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then if you could -- after market growth in the quarter, if you took out Able, so on an organic basis, what was that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Pretty flat.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, thanks very much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "We'll go Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Hi, good morning guys. Could you dive a little bit deeper into the TAPV program? You suggested volumes are going to be a little lower than initially expected. Can you tell us why and what to expect going forward? And then just comment as to whether the inventory levels on the balance sheet are related in part to the TAPV program?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So, you know, we did make initial deliveries in the quarter. Kind of going through that process and dealing with normal - I'd say normal. We had more issues just in terms of consistency and flowing vehicles through that process than we would have expected. The good news is we are now - we are making deliveries every week. We are agreeing with the customer on how many units they are taking and that process appears to be flowing. But it is at a lower level than we would have originally planned in our RLP.", "So while we will make a fair number of deliveries here in the fourth quarter. We will certainly not get to where we would have expected to be, and that's part of our cash pressure. We will have higher finished goods inventory on the TAPV program than we would have expected in our plan. So that is certainly a significant part of the downward revision on our cash for the year.", "So, again there is no, major issue there. The vehicles every week we\u2019re delivering vehicles, vehicles are going in and being delivered to the customer but it\u2019s at a lower rate than we would have planned.", "Jason Gursky", "Great. And then, Scott, really quickly on business jets, could you talk a little bit about the fourth quarter set-up here? Does this fourth quarter feel similar to what you have experienced going into the fourth quarter the last couple of years, with regard to how many bookings you have in hand, with the pipeline, and how you close out the year? Is it going to be as seasonally strong as we've experienced here the last few years? Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "We normally have still aircraft to sell. The good news is in terms of things like the latitude or in a very solid position. But there are still aircraft to sell, and we are closing orders, which is kind of what we expect to see happening. We have NBAA coming up here in a couple of weeks which is usually a pretty significant event in terms of customer interactions and we would expect to see a number of closings come out of that, as well.", "So it's kind of where we've been. We always have aircraft to sell.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "Hi, good morning guys. Scott, on the incremental Scorpion spend, you talked a little bit about it, but could you give us an updated sense of when you are expecting certification from the Air Force? I don't know what else you would be comfortable talking about, in terms of maybe expectations for a first order or a first delivery?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we don't have confirm date yet with Air Force, our teams and the certification folks that right paddle working together very carefully, I mean it's frankly quite busy. I mean there is a lot of activity going on. Lot of the detailed touch plans being finalized, and data been reviewed. So it's in the pros of the process you'd expect. I mean so it\u2019s a very active cert program. We did a lot of work here over the last month obviously to get ready to do a weapons drop which was very successful last week.", "So that was above and beyond certification work or demonstration of its capability which I think was very important to our prospective customers and was being watched very carefully. The acceleration on the production process maturing obviously, we've been always planning to do this initial production configuration aircraft to support certification program, but given the overall activity we've gone ahead and sort of pull the trigger on initiating our small production build to help validate our manufacturing processes as well.", "So I hope we have a lot of customer conversations going on right now. We think there's a number of opportunities to demonstrate this aircraft. We have a bunch customers who want to fly the aircraft and that's really one has to accelerate both the expense side, as well as to bring in the inventory and initiate the limited rating of production because when you have these assets available for customer demonstrations, customer flights and hopefully eventually customer sales.", "But I won't provide any color and I think on a specific closure date of any particular contract, but there's a lot of customer activity and lot of discussions ongoing.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay. You're feeling good about that program. One follow-up on Bell. Your comments on the market, does that include the 412? That was a rough quarter for the 412? Are there campaigns out there? Are you feeling that the 412 would come back? If you could up date us on the 525, if the flight tests are still suspended or not?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So the 412 is certainly very important part of what we see in sort of recovery or there is a number of 412 deals that have closed and there is a number of 412 opportunities that are out there that are actively in negotiation. So I think the 412 is important part of what we see making a turn as we go into '17 and beyond, so that's very positive.", "With respect with 525 again this is NTSB run investigation, they are managing that process. We are obviously cooperating and supporting them in every way that we can. The flight test program is still not moving forward. We have teams that are making preparations for what return to flight looks like and being ready to do that.", "We also obviously continue to do all the non-flight test related certification work which is continuing to progress well. So we don't have a time or date on the exact return to flight that's a process we have to manage through working with the NTSB and FAA, but that investigation work continues to progress.", "Pete Skibitski", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. So your corporate expense was up. Was most of that the accelerated spending on the Scorpion? If so, how does that change your R&D expectation and corporate expense expectation for the full year?", "Frank Connor", "Well, it's probably about half and half split Cai, between the accelerated spending on the Scorpion program which is flowing through there. And also the stock based comp because reversion down a year ago so the relative year-over-year comparison is up.", "So it's kind of split between those two factors about $0.02 to $0.04 each kind of an impact. I would expect to see that and I'd expect to see that flow continue through the fourth quarter as we continue the spending on the Scorpion program, getting the first flight and continuing to work the certification and manufacturing process validation program.", "Scott Donnelly", "So, Cai, on the corporate expense line it obviously will depend on what has stock price in the fourth quarter and there's always those impacts, but it will probably be touch higher than we had originally guided in terms of total year. And in terms of total R&D it's not - it won't change the total R&D spending.", "Frank Connor", "It's not a material number to the total R&D that company guide, but you know the R&D, I expect to continuing pace on the Scorpion program as we accelerated that, but obviously the stock based comp pieces is a little separate issue in terms of what that is in the fourth quarter.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Right. But so the guide actually was narrowed, and so it sounds like we're talking $0.07, $0.08 incremental spending on Scorpion. Is there an offset to is that? A lower tax rate? Stronger ops, in terms of the outlook?", "Frank Connor", "We'll say all of the above. Cai, I think we've seen - if you look at where we thought from the beginning of the year I think Bell is performing very strongly, I think the Systems business is performing very well even in light of challenges around the delays on the TAPV program, industrial guys are doing quite well.", "Again aviation I think is they are performing well in a very difficult environment. We're probably not going to get the leveraging growth that we would like seen to be towards the top end, but then we are throwing a little bit of acceleration on Scorpion and that's kind of where we end up with all those puts and takes around the midpoint of what we guided.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Got it. Last one. If you look at Bell, if you hit your target on V-22s, they are going to be down a lot in the fourth quarter. And so even if you get a pickup in commercial, and certainly based on the third quarter, you got a long way to go. Bell looks like it has a tougher fourth quarter coming up. Does your guidance there change for the year?", "Frank Connor", "No, I think there is a - again the performance of Bell all year has been strong. I think the productivity that we've expected has been delivered on and I think the team will close out on a strong year. ", "Cai von Rumohr", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Samuel Pearlstein ", "Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about the restructuring? You increased it from where you thought at the end of August. You mentioned mostly on the aviation side. Is there a driver there? Is it that the pricing you thought might come through didn't, that causes you to want to restructure your costs? Could you talk a little bit about that?", "Scott Donnelly", "First time I wouldn't attribute it directly to pricing, but I'd say obviously the aviation market continues to be challenging and we're pleased with the impact the new products we're having, the legacy, historic market is still a challenge. And as we look at what we need to do to try to sustain margins and keep the business productive and competitive. We thought the most popular way to do that was look at another cost restructuring there, we're doing the bulk of it frankly to a voluntary program which has been well received. But we really - keep cost in line in a challenging market we thought it was appropriate this time to do that.", "So that's driving the bulk of the net out of the restructuring program we're obviously interested, we needed to do with our exit of the weapons business and overall what's going on across the system segment, but it was right time to take an action in the aviation side as well just given the overall weak demand environment in that industry.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "In the $100 million to $120 million of actual outlays, is that all in 2016?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, it will be split between $0.16 and $0.17. So it's probably - it will probably close to half of this year and half in the '17. A lot of that is severance and what we have some of the - severance costs we borne this year a fair bit that will roll over into the beginning of 2017.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Okay. Last question. Just looking at even the new manufacturing cash flow guidance, pretty substantial step up in Q4, over $500 million probably in free cash. What is it that drives that big step up?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we typically see a fairly strong quarter on the aviation side. All of that inventory which has been accumulating throughout the course of the year which is pretty normal for us. I think we'll also see -- we are starting to flow more deliveries on the vehicle side of the business, which is largely direct conversion in the cash. So those are probably two of the biggest movers. ", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Good morning. Just to follow up on the restructuring, how are you thinking about it across the segments? I've seen some announcements in aviation and within industrial. Anything in Bell, and also, how do you think about the payback there for 2017?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the bulk of the restructuring activity that we added obviously was aviation. So that the previous restructuring we talked about it was largely Systems driven or some associated with the move of the Jacobsen into the Specialized Vehicle business as we shutdown the Charlotte manufacturing operations and move that down to Augusta.", "That's really the only part that's in the industrial segment. So the bulk of it is between Systems and now with the reduction at aviation pretty heavy in that segment. From a payback shareholders if there is any part of this restructuring obviously we expect to see sort of an attritional payback over typical personal related cost six or nine months for part of this obviously in particular that associated with the shutdown of the weapons and Sensors SFW line there is no payback there. This is an exit of a business.", "So I think the right way to think about this on go-forward basis is that we\u2019ll probably see annualized benefits that are roughly equivalent to that 100 million and 120 million that we\u2019re expanding.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Got it. And so within aviation, I guess the $30 million is roughly the payback there. Not to pin numbers down on that. And maybe just to follow on to the aviation margin questions. How could we think about the steady state margin from here. Is it the 7% to 8% mark, assuming R&D is at a normalized level and the pricing dynamic continues on the Latitude?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we\u2019ll finish the year obviously clearly towards the low end or even a little below the initial guidance we would give you on the Aviation segment. On a continued basis we\u2019re probably not ready to do 2017 guidance yet but it\u2019ll all depend on what kind of market we see and what kind of volume leverage we think we\u2019re going to get.", "Right now we\u2019re expecting most of it to be driven by Latitude next year with a little bit of growth driven by Longitude, we\u2019ll hopefully get those certification done and maybe get a couple of initial deliveries in the latter part of next year but again when you look at the margin rates it\u2019s all going to be a matter of what kind of leverage can we get and right now that\u2019s largely new products.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay. And then just last one on King Airs. Can you talk about what you are seeing in the demand environment there?", "Scott Donnelly", "So King Air deliveries were pretty flat and I think that the demand levels have been pretty steady through the course of the year, they\u2019re obviously lower than they were last year. I think we had a good quarter with flat deliveries.", "One of the challenges for the King Air obviously is it\u2019s a more international product and I would say probably about where we\u2019re right now we\u2019re about two-thirds U.S., one-third international on the King Airs and international markets have been somewhat more challenged than the U.S. market so but anyway we feel good about the King Air where it is and sales have been kind of holding in there and it continues to be a pretty popular product.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Good morning. My first question would be around the capital deployment. So if I think about the first half of the year, you issued debt and did some buyback. Q3, you paid down some debt, no buyback. Has anything changed on your perspective on capital deployment? And maybe give us some color around how you look at the inorganic growth opportunities today?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well Julian, I think our perspective hasn\u2019t really changed. Obviously we\u2019re committed to at least doing the buybacks to avoid share dilution and that\u2019s been more than accomplished already in the buybacks that we did in the first quarter. We\u2019ll continue to look at it opportunistically.", "As you pointed out, we did deploy capital, repay debt here in the third quarter which was obviously something that we needed to do. In terms of on a go-forward basis again we\u2019ll continue to provide that same guide. We\u2019re going to avoid dilution and we\u2019ll do the buybacks as we see opportunistically appropriate.", "On the M&A front on a year it's been fairly quiet here lately, I mean there has been a couple of small deals like the Safeaero deal which is very nice little bolt-on for our ground support business which is doing very well for us. We\u2019re very pleased with that business and so we\u2019re continuing to round out the offering that we take through that channel to the same customers and same services support channels makes a lot of sense to us.", "And on the other hand many times we continue to kind of look at things, there is nothing large that we would say is imminent but we\u2019re always kind of keep an eye on opportunities that would help to strengthen and grow the businesses.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "And clearly we have very lightly leveraged balance sheet where we\u2019ve the capacity and the ability to do something if something comes up.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks. And just going back to the aviation restructuring again, not so much the spending and payback and so on, but more a question around the genesis of it. It doesn't sound as if the aviation market, in your perspective, changed much from July on the Q2 quarter, to today.", "So, but at the same time you have launched an incremental restructuring. Is it more the case that the market maybe back in January, you thought you would see a bigger pickup in the second half than what you're actually seeing, or is it the case that the market sequentially did deteriorate slightly?", "Scott Donnelly", "Julian, it\u2019s not a huge swing one way or the other. It\u2019s just been fairly flat on those legacy sides and when we look at our cost structure I mean we obviously been spending a lot of money and doing a lot of things particularly on the R&D front and a lot new product programs and as you look at that the market environment and margins and the expectations for the kind of returns that we need to provide it made sense to take a look at it and see if there are some restructuring to do try to further improve our cost position.", "So I don\u2019t think the market in the segments that we serve have gotten dramatically worse. It just continues to be sort of a stubbornly soft market and I think it was out reaction let\u2019s just try to improve our cost position as we find our way through that.", "Julian Mitchell", "Very clear. A last quick one. Bell margins. Should we expect those to come in at the high end of the initial range that you had provided?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I think those performed extremely well in what was certainly a very difficult market and we\u2019ll probably be towards the high end of our initial guide.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the aftermarket at Bell, what it did in the quarter, and how you see it progressing in the context of this stabilization of demand that you have discussed?", "Scott Donnelly", "So Bell aftermarket was up in the quarter. We kind of reached the point here where we\u2019re sort of a year, more than a year now into what was a fairly significant drop off in utilization associated with oil and gas market in particular. So we\u2019re starting to get a little bit more favorable comps and we did have a positive quarter on the aftermarket side. Now as you know, Seth, you know, from a quarter \u2013 any given quarter to quarter it\u2019s going to be sometimes flattish, sometimes up a few points. We expect that\u2019s kind of the trajectory that we should be ongoing forward.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks. Last one for the industrial business. The margin guidance that you have given previously implies a pretty strong fourth quarter for industrial. Not necessarily relative to what we saw in the first half, but relative to the typical seasonality in industrial. Is that something that's reasonable to expect? Is there anything in particular that's driving it?", "Scott Donnelly", "Nothing in particular, Seth, the industrial segment I mean there is obviously seasonality to some of the businesses and we\u2019ll expect to see that normal seasonality but if you look at the margins that we expect on a total year basis it should be consistent with what we guided. So I don\u2019t think there is nothing notable in the segment.", "Seth Seifman", "Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Peter Arment", "Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a clarification, Scott. You mentioned on the Scorpion, the first flight very soon, is that still expectations before the end of the year, or a little color on that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I think very soon.", "Peter Arment", "Okay, that answers it well. Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks good morning. I am not going to go by segment, but Scott, maybe at a high level when you started the year in sales, it was $14.3 billion of sales, if I triangulate where you are and what you said on commentary, is $13.8 billion the right range that you are shooting for? Flattish year on year in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "I haven\u2019t gone through that number so I probably shouldn\u2019t do math here on the call.", "Myles Walton", "The reason I ask, I mean it sounds like tech systems, obviously you have had a slower TAPV and that's where a lot of the growth is. Bell, you have got a tough comp with last year. Maybe a triangulation on the top line would be helpful.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well actually I want to be careful here not to do too much math and make a mistake on the systems side. Look, I think we\u2019ll \u2013 if you\u2019re thinking about year-over-year kind of numbers I think systems will still have a relatively strong fourth quarter. There is a couple of piece to that. Obviously we are flowing the TAPVs which we didn\u2019t have before.", "We also have deliveries of another U.S. contract which is a rock in Columbian ASVs which will be in there. And as you know we always a little bit of lumpiness here on our Sensor Fuzed Weapon and while there is none in the third quarter it\u2019s because we have another delivery to our customer in the fourth quarter.", "So particularly to the System's side, I think, you'll see a pretty strong fourth quarter and certainly in terms of year-over-year growth.", "Myles Walton", "And then Bell I would think though would be the offset to that on the lower V-22s, unless the guidance point, there's a higher delivery?", "Scott Donnelly", "That's correct, that's correct. Certainly on a year-over-year basis, you'll see a lower revenue number at Bell.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. All right. And then at Bell, there -- was there any positive VAC, sizable of note, in the quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Pretty much the same as it was on a year-over-year basis.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. And then the last clean-up. Fourth quarter tax rate, Frank?", "Frank Connor", "Probably around 30%, full year 29%, 29.5%", "Myles Walton", "Okay. All right. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ronald Epstein", "Good morning, guys. Just a couple quick questions for you. Maybe I'll start off with Frank. When you look at the inventory, from quarter to quarter, it went up a couple hundred million bucks, and year over year, it looks like it was $700 million or $800 million. What's driving that?", "Frank Connor", "Well, as we said we've seen some lower deliveries on the TAPV which is contributed a little bit of it. But if you look at it, we started the year couple of $100 million up in inventory versus the end of '15. Frankly, inventory has increased at about the same rate through the first nine months of '16 versus the first nine months of '15.", "So we are seeing the normal trending of inventory. We do have some slightly higher inventory levels than in some areas like TAPV, then we would have plans for, which is putting a little bit of pressure on cash. But if it's not wildly off from what we had expected or what we have seen in previous years. Just given the seasonality of the business, there is still some additional pressure or some additional inventory and they're also for Scorpion as we talked about that we wouldn't have had on a year-over-year basis.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay. One more question for you, Frank, and then I have got one for Scott. Organic growth, revenue organic growth year over year, was it approximately flat if you take out the stuff from acquisitions?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, it was. Yes.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay. That's fair enough, that seems like. And then, Scott, a lot of talk about Scorpion this morning, which, the airplane I love. We have been talking about that one for a long time. I think, and maybe you picked up a little bit of this on the call, I think there is some skepticism in the investor community about a Company-funded defense program, right?", "So things like the Northrop F-20 pop up and that thing. When you think about the return of investment on the Scorpion, and what your expectations are for this program, how can you make us all feel comfortable that, yes, this was a good place for Textron to invest their money?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Ron, I think that we've been running this program for a few years now. We've been able, you know, for the most part to run this thing in a way that was at a low enough level of investment that we were making accomplishments, getting the first flights, being able to talk to customers and kind of feel out what this market could be from just the original sort of a theory of what it might be to interacting with real customers, engaging their level of interest.", "And so I'd say over the last few years we've been able run it without sort of making an impact that would be problematic. This is the first quarter where we had to say, look, this is having an impact on what we would have guided you guys both in terms of expense as well as awesome cash impact as we build inventory, actually make a run of aircraft.", "This is certainly not still assure bet standpoint, but I mean obviously, we would not do that and make those investments and then take that hit in terms of you know near-term earnings and cash if we didn't think that the level of customer interest that we're seeing the fact we now have a path to certification, in fact we demonstrated weapons capabilities, the level of interest we have from customers we've been talking to for a number of years has become strong enough that we felt it was time to accelerate that spending and be willing to invest some of our cash to be ready to do a limited production run here.", "So is that a sure thing? No. Do we see that the opportunity is real and that we think that there is a real future for this thing, and someday could be a profitable line of business for the company? I'll have to say the answer is yes or we wouldn't have made the decisions to go ahead and take some pressure on earnings and pressure on cash to really take that final step and bring this thing to the market in a very real credible way.", "Ronald Epstein", "So one follow-on to that. When you think about the return on invested capital, one would think you could do better with this, than you can with the purely commercial program. Is that a reasonable view?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I think when we look at what we believe and again the conversations with customers on where we can prices this aircraft it's a very, it's a from a customer perspective a very competitive price versus the options that are out there in the market in terms of the performance that you get for the dollars, the capability per dollar so we think we can do that and have it be a very solid profitable program for us.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Justin Bergner", "Thanks and good morning Scott. Just a couple clean-up questions. In terms of the changed cash flow guidance, it seems like about half of the change is coming from the cash restructuring outlay, and half from perhaps higher inventories on the TAPV side. Is that how I should think of the bridge, or are there other pieces to think about?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I\u2019d say there is a number of pieces you know as any year right of cash coming in and out and inventory levels but for sure when you look at there is a pressure on the restructuring cash out, there is a pressure on slower TAPV deliveries and some Scorpion inventory coming in but there is some positives in other areas and some better working capital management, there's a lot of moving parts that sums to that but certainly what you mentioned are two of the, are the biggest movers in terms of contributors of the pressure.", "Justin Bergner", "Okay. Great. And then given your glass half full comments on Bell, are you optimistic about the backlog growing in future quarters, or is it more a function of the higher orders allowing for backlog stability going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we'll see some better backlog on the commercial side. Remember that the backlog on that business is very lumpy because of the multiyear you\u2019re sure that gets authorized and funded that rolls into backlog. So the backlog number at Bell will always be, you'll see some pretty significant swings driven by particularly the military side of business.", "Justin Bergner", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "John Walsh", "Hi good morning. This is John Walsh on for Jeff. So a lot of ground covered so far, appreciate that. I wanted to go back to aviation, and think about jet lead times on new orders. Not asking for a program by program, but if you had a lumpier new and refreshed programs versus the legacy, any color on the lead time deltas between those two buckets?", "Scott Donnelly", "I am sorry. John, when you say lead time?", "John Walsh", "Yes, just if somebody and you made a comment earlier on Latitudes, right? There is still orders to sell. I'm just trying to get a sense of the demand, how fast you can fill out a order on legacy, or if there are lead times growing for other newer, refreshed models.", "Scott Donnelly", "I am sorry John, we try to stay away from doing any particular guidance on sold out and lead time availability on a model by model basis. I mean, and there is a fair bit of variation across new models, there is even variation obviously across the so called legacy models.", "John Walsh", "Okay. Are there any expectations that you could end up with some white tails here at year end?", "Scott Donnelly", "We really haven't talked about white tails for a number of years. We have aircraft being delivered in the first quarter so there's obviously we plan and always have inventory that rolls from year to year because it's inside the manufacturing lead time to deliver aircraft when you get into the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter.", "But right now as we have been doing for quite a number of years now we\u2019re building to a forecast and we\u2019ve been matching that fairly well to the demand.", "John Walsh", "Okay. And then one last one, on pension in the next year. Any early look on the expense side, or on any cash funding side?", "Frank Connor", "Well on expense side as we\u2019ve said obviously the discount rates bouncing around, interest rates are bouncing around but we would expect it to be kind of no worse than flat on a year-over-year basis and on the funding side no additional funding other than normal course defined contribution funding and the small amount of other funding that we do. So no pick up from this year's funding levels.", "John Walsh", "Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Just one follow-up, Scott. Aviation deliveries were up every quarter this year. Will you beat the 60 in the fourth quarter of this year that you delivered last year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would expect so. I think that we will George and we\u2019ll have a solid quarter obviously Latitude deliveries and I think you know net of everything we would certainly expect to be up on a volume of jets on a year-over-year basis.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, because you had 12 Latitudes in the fourth quarter of last year. So you'll deliver more than that, you think?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And then just the last thing. I went back and looked, and it's the first time in a number of years that you had a book to bill equal or better than 1 for two successive quarters. Does that support your comment that you are starting to see order improvement in the industry?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I don\u2019t know George, I am hesitant to forecast the future because it\u2019s so hard but I mean obviously we\u2019re always happy to get better than 1 to 1.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "I had a question on Kautex, Scott. I think you are building a fifth plant in China, now. Can you talk about what's motivating that? Has that helped you gain share, your presence in China? Is it a growth signal? Frankly, is there a long-term competitive risk to that? I am just curious about the strategy surrounding that.", "Scott Donnelly", "The long-term view on China it\u2019s a massive automotive market, it continues to grow. It\u2019s been a good market for us frankly. We've had a very strong business in China and as that volume continues to grow our customers are doing well and we - as you know these programs when you're building tanks for these platform they tend to be fairly long cycle.", "So when we commit to go in and invest the capital in a new plant and a new machines and stuff like that, we clearly have line of sight to where that capacity is going to be utilized and on what platforms that capacity will be utilized on. So we don't see much downside risk to underutilization of those assets and certainly that\u2019s been our history over there is that these plants are well utilized and deliver good returns.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay. So is there -- the more plants you build -- I guess is there more tailwind there, in terms of adding capacity, and maybe shifting your customer base from European OEMs to Chinese OEMs?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well I am not sure, the way we look at it as shifting I mean again, we really do this and make these decisions based on specific opportunities, specific platforms that we win and that's what drives us. So in terms of how we think about capital allocation in that business in the future we allocate it to the places where we've won with a customer and need to produce locally. So I think if you look in net this year so far we\u2019ve actually have more growth in Europe than we've had in North America or Asia and that\u2019s because our customers in Europe have had higher growth rates.", "But again our allocation of our capital and where we choose to put locations is very highly driven to how we\u2019re doing and who we\u2019re winning with and where in the world. So we really let that drive - drive it as opposed to a philosophy of being in one particular region or the other.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Okay.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Eric Salander", "Thanks Brad.", "Operator", "Go ahead.", "Eric Salander", "And good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release. On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.1 billion, down $108 million from last year\u2019s first quarter. During this year\u2019s first quarter, we recorded $37 million of pre-tax special charges, or $0.09 per share after-tax, of which $22 million was attributable to the Arctic Cat acquisition that closed on March 6, 2017, and $15 million related to the restructuring plan we announced last year. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.46 per share, down $0.09 from last year\u2019s first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions reflected a use of cash of $205 million compared to a use of cash of $222 million in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Overall, revenues and profits were down in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. We\u2019re continuing to execute our restructuring plan while maintaining our focus on new product introductions and integration of acquired businesses, all of which will have a positive impact on our long-term growth outlook.", "At Bell, revenues were down on lower military volumes for the quarter due to the timing of H-1 deliveries. Despite the lower volumes in the quarter, Bell achieved an 11.9% operating margin. We delivered 27 commercial helicopters, down from 30 in last year\u2019s first quarter; six V-22s, flat with last year; and three H-1s, down from 10 last year.", "On the commercial side, we\u2019ve seen our third straight quarter of improved year-over-year order flow. And we achieved the first deliveries of our new 505 Jet Ranger X helicopter in the quarter, and order conversion remained strong. We also had a good showing at HAI this year, where we displayed our first concept aircraft, the FCX-001, demonstrating innovations that could revolutionize the future of rotorcraft. On the service side, we were named number one in the helicopter service and support for the 23rd consecutive year by Pro Pilot magazine.", "Moving to systems, revenues were up as we were able to accelerate our weapon delivery in the quarter, along with continued TAPV deliveries, although the TAPV program remains a challenge. During the first quarter of 2017, TAPV production has not ramped up as anticipated, resulting in inefficiencies and revised estimates for production costs on the remaining vehicles still to be delivered under this contract.", "Based on our revised estimates, we\u2019ve recorded a $24 million loss in this contract in the first quarter of 2017. This unfavorable performance was partially offset by strong program execution at Unmanned Systems. In our Unmanned Systems business, we received an award for two additional common unmanned surface vessels in support of the Navy\u2019s mine countermeasure mission. In our TRU Simulation + Training business, we qualified six commercial air transport full flight simulators and received an additional 777X full flight simulator order from Boeing.", "Moving to industrial, we saw a 4.2% increase in revenues, primarily reflecting the impact of higher volumes at Kautex and the acquisition of Arctic Cat, which we closed in the first week of March. Arctic Cat, which is now part of our Textron Specialized Vehicles business, immediately broadens our presence in the powersports segment and significantly expands our dealer network.", "In specialized vehicles, we also began delivering on our new ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the quarter. The ELiTE offers high efficiency with zero battery maintenance and further demonstrates our industry-leading product innovation.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $121 million. We delivered 35 jets, up from 34 last year; 12 King Airs, just down from 26 last year; and two Beechcraft T-6 trainers compared to 11 last year. We were encouraged by the pricing trends on retail sales in the quarter as we experienced a sequential increase in price across all Citation and King Air models.", "Citation Longtitude continues to makes progress towards certification by year-end, with a third aircraft entering a flight test program during the quarter. On the military side, last week, we received a $61 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for services and support on our Beechcraft T-6 aircraft.", "Moving to Scorpion, our second production aircraft had a successful first flight earlier this week and will enter the flight test program. In March, the U.S. Air Force formally authorized our OA-X light attack aircraft experimentation program, for which we have offered to demonstrate the capabilities of both the Scorpion and the AT-6 later this summer.", "To finish, we are updating Textron\u2019s 2017 financial guidance to adjust for the Arctic Cat acquisition. We\u2019re now expecting full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, which reflects earnings per share dilution of $0.10 per share, consistent with our expectations at the time we announced that transaction. Our outlook for cash flow for the continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions remains in the range of $650 million to $750 million.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $219 million, down $61 million from the first quarter of 2016 on $108 million decrease in revenue. Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $121 million from this period last year, primarily due to lower commercial and defense-related turboprop volumes, partially offset by higher pre-owned volumes.", "Segment profit was $36 million, down from $73 million a year ago, primarily as a result of lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1 billion, approximately flat from year-end. Moving to Bell, revenues were down $117 million, primarily due to lower H-1 program revenues. Segment profit increased $1 million from the first quarter of 2016 despite the lower volumes, reflecting favorable performance. Backlog in the segment was $5.7 billion at the end of the quarter, up $292 million from the end of the fourth quarter.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $92 million, primarily due to higher Weapons and Sensors and Marine and Land Systems volumes. Segment profit was down $9 million due to unfavorable performance at Marine and Land. Backlog in the segment was $1.7 billion, down $113 million from the end of the fourth quarter.", "Industrial revenues increased $40 million due to the impact of acquisitions and higher volumes at Kautex. Segment profit was down $15 million, primarily due to unfavorable performance, which includes the operating results of Arctic Cat. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $1 million.", "Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $27 million compared to $32 million last year. This reflected the transition of the Scorpion program to Textron Aviation, partially offset by the effect of a higher stock price on stock-based compensation. Interest expense was $34 million, essentially flat with last year. Our effective tax rate was 17.4%, reflecting benefits recognized in the first quarter of 2017 resulting from audit settlements and the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation.", "During the quarter, we\u2019ve recorded pre-tax special charges of $37 million, which included $22 million attributable to the Arctic Cat acquisition and $15 million related to the restructuring plan we announced last year. To update our previously announced restructuring plan, we now anticipate pre-tax charges of $155 million to $170 million from a previously announced range of $140 million to $170 million.", "Through the first quarter of 2017, we have recognized pre-tax charges of $38 million under this plan. In connection with the Arctic Cat acquisition, we are estimating full year pre-tax restructuring charges of $30 million. During the quarter, we issued $350 million of 10-year notes at an attractive rate of 3.65%, and we repurchased approximately 4 million shares, returning $186 million in cash to shareholders.", "As Scott mentioned earlier and consistent with our initial full year guidance range, we are now expecting a full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which reflects earnings per share dilution of $0.10 per share from Arctic Cat. We are maintaining our outlook for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $650 million to $750 million despite an estimated use of cash of $55 million related to the Arctic Cat acquisition.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So operator, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll move to the first question with George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi, George.", "Operator", "Mr. Shapiro, your line is open. George, you may have your mute on perhaps.", "Scott Donnelly", "Probably move to the next question.", "Operator", "Sure. We will go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Thank you very much. So your guide update, based on the first quarter tax rate, it looks like we\u2019re going to have a lower tax rate and weaker ops than you had when you first guided. So maybe update us in terms of where is the tax rate likely to be for 2017. And maybe run us through the operations because it kind of looks like some of them are going to be light.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Cai, let me say, on the operational side, most of the businesses performed consistent with where we expected and actually, most of them probably a little bit stronger performance, the exception, of course, being the TAPV program. And obviously, that\u2019s a headwind for us. So that $24 million of NOP, I think, largely, over the course of the year, we think we can offset that. As I said, we saw stronger performance in our Unmanned Systems business, we saw stronger performance at Bell. And again, in general, most of the businesses are performing well. The tax rate certainly will have some benefit.", "Although the tax rate this quarter is lower, I think in the second, third, fourth quarter, we would expect to be in our more nominal rate, which means we\u2019ll probably finish the year something just under 30% in terms of the overall tax rate for the company. But the issue for us really is to focus on the operations and find offsets to the impact of the $24 million charge on the TAPV program, and I think we can work hard to get there through better performance in most of the businesses.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Okay. And then a quick one on aviation. Maybe explain why the turbo \u2013 the King Airs were as weak and what you expect for the year. And walk us through your color about pricing improvement \u2013 improving as you went through the quarter for biz jets.", "Scott Donnelly", "So I would say, on the King Air side, Cai, as you know, the King Air side traditionally had been a fairly international product, usually averaging around half of our sales, sometimes more than that. And right now, with kind of where economies are and the strength of the dollar, it\u2019s just been tough selling on the King Air front, so we only had three international deliveries of King Airs. I think if you look at the order pipeline, you talk to our sales teams, they feel pretty good that we\u2019ll see a positive trend as we go through the course of the year and feel like we can get to what our original plan was even though we\u2019re obviously lighter than we would have expected to be here in the first quarter. So that\u2019s kind of the color, I suppose, on the King Airs.", "The T-6s, that will not be the case, right? I mean we know \u2013 that was built in to our original plan, that we would see low deliveries on T-6s. And again, there\u2019s some other opportunities out there, which I think will help us in the future, but it\u2019s going to be a pretty tough year. And we always understood that on the T-6 front. On the pricing in general, as we talked about on the last call, we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019ve sort of reestablished what we\u2019re willing to do in terms of pricing in the marketplace, and obviously, we\u2019ve had to communicate that with customers. There is still a very good deal, frankly, compared to historical pricing in the market, but I think it reflects our view of where we need to be to have a healthy business.", "And so there were difficult conversations with many customers. I think as we got towards the end of the quarter, people started to understand that, that\u2019s just the reality of where we are. And we did see incremental improvements in pricing across every model, and we expect to continue that on a go-forward basis. And that was true on both the Citation as well as the King Air front. So again, I think we\u2019re in a \u2013 we all know we\u2019re in a weaker demand environment maybe than we\u2019ve seen in the past. We\u2019ve adjusted production rates down on a number of these aircraft, and we need to hold the line on the pricing to keep the business healthy.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to the next question in queue that will come from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. So I guess one bright spot in these results was the Bell margin performance. I think you\u2019d guided that to drop about 100 points for the year as a whole. Obviously, you had a good improvement in the margin in the first quarter. So was there anything specific around mix or anything that supported the Bell profits in Q1 that you think unwinds over the balance of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Julian, I mean, we\u2019re a little bit light, obviously, on the revenue side, but that wasn\u2019t really a mix issue. It\u2019s H-1s, which were something that which \u2013 was relatively minor issue. We had some tolerance issues, which has been resolved in aircraft during flight tests, so I expect we\u2019re more or less on plan in terms of how we expect the year to go from a revenue standpoint. I think I wouldn\u2019t change our guidance in terms of how we think about Bell for the balance of the year. But \u2013 certainly strong performance, but it was across the board, with one \u2013 no one specific thing or no specific mix impact that affected it.", "So I think we\u2019ll perform to what we guided, and maybe there\u2019s a little upside based on the performance of the business for the year. I think the guys are doing a nice job.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks. And then just with the aviation profitability, you talked about the Scorpion being about a $50 million EBIT impact in that segment for the year. Was there any particular sort of front loading in those costs? And I guess, related to that, how do you feel about the overall aviation cost base exiting Q1 in light of the orders performance?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. Sure, so absolutely. If you look at the Scorpion program, we forecasted kind of within the guide to be about 100 basis point dilution for the year. That\u2019s certainly very much front-end loaded. It was in the order of a couple of 100 basis points or so in the quarter, just to give you a sense of that. And that\u2019s just the fact that we\u2019re sort of in the heavy-spend part of that program in the latter part of last year, beginning half of this year as we get the aircraft ready for the flight test program, for the airworthiness as well as, obviously, our expectation that we\u2019ll be able to participate in this Air Force experimentation program.", "So we\u2019ve got a lot of spend here in getting those aircraft in the air and not just the aircraft themselves but the mission systems that are expected to be there for the Air Force experimentation program. So absolutely, in the case of Scorpion, that\u2019s very front half of the year loaded in terms of its impact to the aviation business.", "I\u2019d say in terms of the cost base, in general, the aviation guys actually did a pretty nice job in the quarter, delivering where we expected them to be, even though we were lighter than we expected to be on the King Air front. So there\u2019s no question that volume was below our plan for the first quarter, again, driven primarily by the King Airs. But given the King Air volume that was not there and what we anticipated in terms of the volume and mix on the jet side, the performance and the cost controls were where they needed to be to deliver on the operating plan.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Could you talk a little bit more about Arctic Cat? Just help me understand, I guess, what should the Industrial segment look like this year now as you consolidate that and we look at the intangible amortization? And you talked about the $55 million of outflow this year. How should we think about, I guess, from an earnings benefit or even a cash impact into 2018 at this point?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, most of the negative impact of the acquisition in terms of the 2017 financials is driven by solving the inventory issue, which has been out there for some time and which we knew about, obviously, and talked about as part of the deal. And that was clearly factored into our valuation of deal economics. So this issue of 2017 operating performance is really very highly correlated to those rebate programs associated with clearing out the older-model product, and that will have, obviously, the operating profit hit and, certainly, the cash hit.", "And we have factored that in. As you noticed, we did not change our cash forecast for the year. We think we have other opportunities in general in terms of working capital management that we can use to offset that $55 million of cash outflow associated with, in essence, cleaning of the inventory balance and the dealers as we go through the balance of the year.", "We expect to clear the lion\u2019s share of that out. Frankly, we\u2019re already getting pretty good traction. The guys are very, very focused on resolving that issue. So we\u2019ve already seen a fair bit, which is why we had some impact in the quarter, of coming out of the gate and we know we have to go clean up the dealer channel to get this thing back on a growth trajectory and then generating good profit. And that\u2019s certainly our expectation for 2018.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And then from a restructuring standpoint, can you help me just to \u2013 it looks like the total restructuring plan moved up a little bit relative to, I guess, the case that you could spend up as much as \u2013 or have as much as a $47 million hit this year, but now it looks like it\u2019s a smaller amount. So did programs get pushed into 2018? Does it carry forward longer? Can you just update us on the restructuring?", "Scott Donnelly", "No. I think on the initial restructuring program that we announced, we brought the bottom of the range up a little bit, so we\u2019ve tightened it. But the top of it remains what we had discussed in previous guidance, so there\u2019s no real change there other than just tightening it. And then that will certainly be done by the end of 2017. I mean the bulk of it will be done by the end of the next quarter. There\u2019s a little bit that trickles out towards the end of the year, and that\u2019s just because, in the case particularly of Jacobsen, we\u2019re sort of moving that stuff one production line at a time, and so it does go out to the end of the year.", "In the case of the restructuring associated with Arctic Cat, the bulk of that was taken here in the first quarter because it had to do primarily with deal costs and change of control clauses and things associated with the transaction, severance of folks here immediately. And there\u2019s a little bit through the \u2013 principally through the second, somewhat third quarter, but the bulk of it has already been taken.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And one last question. Just with all the discussion about the Navy potentially looking at more ships, has there been any change in terms of the desire to pull forward Ship to Shore Connector? Is there any change in kind of the outlook for that program?", "Scott Donnelly", "So there are \u2013 there have been some discussions about increasing the initial LRIP buy. Right now, the original plan was a couple of ships. They\u2019re talking about that could be as high as 5 ships. We\u2019re in discussions with the Navy right now in terms of getting ready for the long-lead material to support that contract. But to be honest, I mean, they don\u2019t have a budget right now.", "So I can\u2019t tell you whether that number is 2 or 5, but the program of record appears very solid. The program \u2013 I think the Navy is happy with where things are and how they\u2019re progressing and, as I said, are ready to start long lead for the LRIP program, but unfortunately, just given the status of \u2013 I mean, the CR and all the budgetary turmoil that\u2019s going on, we nor they, I don\u2019t think, have a very good visibility right now as to what the number of units will be for this first LRIP tranche.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Recearch. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard", "Hi, Thanks very much. Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi, Rob.", "Robert Stallard", "Scott, I was wondering if you could start on aviation and whether you could comment on the regional demand profile, whether you\u2019ve seen any pickup in demand from the U.S. region.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, most of the demand is still very U.S.-centric. I think, obviously, we\u2019ve been there for a while, and I don\u2019t necessarily see that changing here over the next few quarters. We do see some activity in Europe, which is encouraging. We\u2019ve had a couple of transactions in South America, but it\u2019s still a very U.S.-centric market right now.", "Robert Stallard", "And have you now seen any major pickup in the U.S. because we\u2019ve seen some pretty positive economic indicators?", "Scott Donnelly", "There\u2019s \u2013 the pipeline, I think the guys feel pretty good about. And obviously, we\u2019re pretty flat on a year-over-year basis in terms of the number of jets, but I think there\u2019s still folks that are kind of waiting to see what happens particularly around the tax reform side. So there\u2019s a little bit of a stall, kind of waiting to see what\u2019s going to happen around taxes and, therefore, expectations that people have around the U.S. economy. So I think people are still positive, but a little bit guarded, waiting to see what will happen.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay. And then on the TAPV, could you elaborate on what the issues were in the quarter and why you are confident you can reclaim the situation by the end of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I hate to go through a litany. Look, the problem of this thing has been a series of issues, none of which are rocket science to fix, but things that just have not been \u2013 met the expectation that the customer has in terms of some things around finish, and we\u2019ve had some paint issues. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 yes, it\u2019s been a handful of issues, each one of which has largely led to some increases in bill of material cost and, more importantly, rework to get the vehicle to an acceptable condition.", "And again, it\u2019s not stuff that\u2019s particularly technically challenging, but they\u2019ve been a series of issues, and that\u2019s driven not only bill of material growth but an awful lot of rework. And that\u2019s slowed down the pace of deliveries, and it has driven increased rework costs. And that\u2019s why we finally got to a position, so look, we just have to take this charge.", "Obviously, our expectation is, is that we\u2019re done with that. We need to do a better job here on the ramp of deliverables. I think we can still get to where we need to get to by the end of this year per our plan, but certainly, the first quarter, we did not see the ramp that we expected to see. And that impacted both cash in terms of getting these things delivered and out of inventory and, even more importantly, it\u2019s driven higher costs, which has resulted in the charge.", "Robert Stallard", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Scott, a couple of Scorpion questions for you. Can you walk us through the process from here, a possible Air Force order, implications for the program, whether you win or lose and just the competitive landscape there as you progress?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, the experimentation program is a stand-alone program, right. So this is basically Air Force saying, we want to see what\u2019s out there that would support that category of mission. So they have articulated what their expectations are, what kinds of things they would like to see demonstrated. They issued that. Companies were invited to send in proposals on what they would be able to demonstrate if they were invited to do that. We have done that for both Scorpion and AT-6.", "We think both aircraft, I mean, whilst they\u2019re different aircraft in terms of the performance envelope, can both fit within the realm of what kinds of capabilities the Air Force is looking to see demonstrated. So we\u2019ll know here probably in another month whether we have been invited to participate in that.", "The expectation right now is, at that program, the actual flying of the aircraft would occur in that kind of August into September time frame. And what the Air Force has been saying publicly is that they will use that experimentation program to help inform them as to what\u2019s out there and available and use that as a basis to decide whether they\u2019re going to put together a program of record on a go-forward basis.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "And given your comments earlier on Ship to Shore, how does CR come into play and budgetary concerns, et cetera, if at all?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, under a CR, obviously, you\u2019re not going to see any new programs. So \u2013 but I think that anything that would happen around Ship to Shore expansion is going to be a combination of what ultimately is approved even in the FY 2017 budget, as you know, which doesn\u2019t exist. So the resolution of the FY 2017 and then, clearly, what\u2019s going to be in the FY 2018 budget will drive programs like Ship to Shore in terms of their ability to ramp up and go into a limited-rate and, ultimately, full-rate production. And certainly, anything around an OA-X-type program is something that\u2019s going to need to be embedded within an FY 2018 budget.", "So obviously, the Air Force has the flexibility to allocate some money to do things like an experimentation program to understand what\u2019s out there, but any kind of real acquisition program is something that would have to, I think, at this point, be in the FY 2018 budget. Maybe there is something they can put in to get something started in FY 2017, but I think most of the funding associated with these larger programs would have to be FY 2018 budgets.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "A quick question for Frank, if I could slip one in. Frank, I think you mentioned buybacks in the quarter, $180 million or so. Can you just talk more about the step up there and internally, how you\u2019re thinking about capital returns given that shift?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. It\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019ve been, which is we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to look to buy stock to at least offset the dilution associated with our employee stock programs and that, above that, we would look to be opportunistic kind of around share repurchase and return of capital relative to acquisition activities and other needs for the cash. And so it was just a reflection of the fact that with the Arctic Cat acquisition happening kind of fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t buy much stock kind of, and so we look to offset some of the dilution and do other things in the first quarter here.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Pete Skibitski", "Good morning, guys. Just to finish up on Arctic Cat, can you give us your updated expectations for Industrial revenue for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "So the Arctic Cat is probably going to be somewhere around $0.5 million, I\u2019m sorry, $0.5 billion of revenue, and it\u2019s about 100 basis point dilution, which obviously hits sort of $0.10 EPS that we talked about and now have baked into the latest number.", "Peter Skibitski", "Got it, okay. Thank you. And then, Scott, is there any upside to Bell margin guidance for the year? You started off pretty well there, and you talked about H-1 timing. And so those will ramp the rest of the year, and I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re at least in line with the sector average. Any thoughts there?", "Scott Donnelly", "They are. Yes, look, Pete, I think, if we look at businesses that had strong performance in the first quarter or that we expect to continue through the balance of the year, it\u2019s certainly a couple of the systems businesses and Bell. I think the guys \u2013 again, it performed very well on the margin rate, and I think that we continue, as we\u2019ve talked about, to feel pretty good about opportunities around the 412, which is a good margin product for us. And you\u2019re right, the H-1s is purely a timing issue, and they tend to be in line with the segment margin rates. So yes, I would say there is probably some upside potential at least on the margin rate side at Bell for the year.", "Pete Skibitski", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth Seifman", "Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. I guess, can you tell us \u2013 do you plan to also offer the T-6 for the light attack experiment?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, yes. No, we\u2019ll submit both the Scorpion as well as the AT-6, which is the attack variant of the T-6 trainer. So the experimentation in terms of the way it was expressed by the Air Force, in terms of the requirements or what they want to see demonstrated was, I think, intentionally broad enough to pick up a pretty broad swath of capability that would involve everything from aircraft class of the AT-6 in the sort of the single-engine turboprop class of aircraft up to and including twin jet kind of aircraft like a Scorpion-type aircraft.", "So it\u2019s a \u2013 the breadth or how wide, they kind of said, hey, here\u2019s what \u2013 we\u2019d like to see aircraft with the following kinds of capability, was, I think, very \u2013 intentionally very broad. And so where ultimately they want to go from a requirement standpoint, then \u2013 if they go at all, is I think to be informed by that. And so they\u2019ll be able to see aircraft that range everything from, I\u2019d say, the light turboprop space to the heavier jets. And the good news for us is we can put both capabilities into the program.", "Seth Seifman", "Yes. And just as a follow-up, just a follow-up on Pete\u2019s last question. Guidance for Industrial, excluding Arctic Cat, is that still about $4 billion of sales and a 9% margin?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. That was the original guidance. And as Scott said, kind of Arctic Cat will be $400 million to $500 million, and about 1% dilution will be best reflected in that $ 0.10 of dilution that we indicated.", "Seth Seifman", "Okay. Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Frank, if I could start with you. Just on the manufacturing cash flow, can you talk a little bit about the working capital build in the quarter? And how do you think that swings, if it swings positively in Q2, and just the ramp-up for the full year?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. Sheila, obviously, kind of Q1 is always a bit of a build for us as we \u2013 given the seasonality of the business. The first quarter from a balance sheet impact \u2013 or standpoint was impacted by Arctic Cat. So when you look at working capital, for instance, about $140 million of the inventory increase related to the Arctic Cat acquisition. So it\u2019s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison. But kind of generally, we did okay on the working capital side, I\u2019d say, in the first quarter, and we expect things to improve as we move forward and that Q2 kind of will be better than Q1 and cash flow will continue to improve as we move through the year.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then one on systems, if I could ask, just the top line trajectory there. Weapons and Sensors is pretty strong. Is that expected to continue throughout the year? Or is that the \u2013 how do we think about the last Sensor Fuzed Weapons shipments and just the profitability swings there quarterly?", "Scott Donnelly", "So there\u2019s, basically, at this point, Sheila, one additional delivery that will happen for the balance of the lot on SFW. Right now, we\u2019re in conversations with the customer on that as to whether that will be a third quarter or a second quarter delivery. Right now, on a contractual basis, it\u2019s probably out in the third quarter. If they have an issue in taking them, we could probably \u2013 and again, not certain but we could probably get the deliveries and inspections completed to deliver on the second quarter if that\u2019s what they want to do, and that would be the last delivery.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then so the profitability mix sort of is in line with the full year guidance of 8.5%. It normalizes once weapons comes down a bit and TAPV, I guess, resets.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, the impact there \u2013 the only thing that\u2019s not factored into that guidance is that $24 million of the impact on TAPV. Now as I said earlier, I think some of the offsets to that, from a program performance standpoint, are likely to be Unmanned Systems. So we\u2019ll see some mitigation in \u2013 within the systems segment, but part of the offset will also be in other segments. So you can certainly expect that we will be on the low end or below the guidance range on systems as a result of that TAPV charge.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Understood, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Peter Arment", "Yes. Good morning, Scott and Frank. Just a quick one on \u2013 back on Scorpion. Just Scott, how many \u2013 you mentioned the second production aircraft just had its first flight. How many do you need for the Air Force program?", "Scott Donnelly", "What you could do it with just one. They kind of leave that up to the companies. We obviously have 2 that are flying right now. We\u2019ll actually have a third that will be flying at that point in time. And so depending on how they want to schedule things and run the operation, we could support that with probably 1 or 2 aircraft. And then we would have a third aircraft that\u2019s really dedicated to the flight test program associated with airworthiness.", "Peter Arment", "Okay. And then just switching over on the \u2013 you mentioned unmanned, that demand was there. Is that really \u2013 is that just operational tempo that\u2019s impacting that? Or what specifically is driving that?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s operational tempo, which is strong, and just performance in terms of managing cost and executing on the other contracts pretty efficiently. So I think, overall, that business is \u2013 flows to the next quarter, and I would expect that will continue for the balance of the year.", "Peter Arment", "Okay. And lastly, just you mentioned \u2013 I think the T-6 shipments for the year, we know, are going to be down significantly. I think the last time I heard, it was about 15 or so. Is that still a good number to use?", "Frank Connor", "It\u2019s a little lower than that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Probably 10 to \u2013 somewhere in the 10 or 12 for the total year.", "Peter Arment", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ron Epstein", "Yes. Good morning, guys.", "Frank Connor", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Ron Epstein", "Just a couple of quick questions. Most \u2013 everything has been asked. Frank, on the delinquencies, they were up, and just not a big number but it was up 50% year-over-year. What\u2019s going on there? Is there anything? Is it just seasonality? Or what\u2019s going on there?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. There is no \u2013 really no trends. It bounces around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but there is no trends. And we feel good about kind of how the portfolio is doing.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. And then moving back to the vehicles business. As we go into the spring here, and I would imagine the selling season for side-by-side vehicles is picking up, how does that look? I mean, can you give us any color on the order activity and the shipment to the channel and all that sort of stuff?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it\u2019s fairly soft right now, Ron. Again, the challenge that we have on the company as we acquired it was the \u2013 frankly, they have too much inventory. And so the first step out of the gate here has been to put together these programs to help \u2013 put rebating together to help the dealers move it out. I think that\u2019s been very well received, and as I said, we\u2019re already starting to see the impact of that. In terms of restocking, which is certainly very important to us, we have, obviously, the Stampede product line and we have some additional \u2013 new products that are coming out.", "And we have scheduled, frankly, the \u2013 basically just about the whole month of May are going through with that dealer channel and meeting with them and explaining the products that are in the pipeline and what\u2019s available to show them what\u2019s new that they want to put out on the floor. So the timing of the deal was probably not ideal just in terms of when it closed because you\u2019re kind of into that season. Obviously, we couldn\u2019t go out and be part of that process before the deal closed.", "But having the deal now closed, we do have meetings set up with all the dealers in kind of a region-by-region basis. We\u2019ve got all our sales folks now aligned post deal. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re just now, frankly, as we\u2019re going to the month May, able to have these conversations with that channel around what products are now being added, what\u2019s going on in terms of new products, both things within the Arctic Cat pipeline as well as what was in the Textron off-road pipeline and to really start that selling process.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay. And then maybe one last one. Kind of moving back to Scorpion again. In the past, there had been some discussion around international opportunities, right? Kind of everybody is focusing on this U.S. Air Force light attack. But in the Middle East, there were some opportunities and so on and so forth. What\u2019s going on there? Can you give us some color on what\u2019s going on with Scorpion outside of the U.S.?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. So they\u2019re still there. We continue those conversations with those customers. We are at the phase right now, frankly, with one of the more important ones who\u2019s already scheduling when they\u2019re coming over to fly the aircraft. We have to do a certain number of hours and get certain tickets from the FAA to allow somebody that\u2019s not our experimental pilots to fly these things. But now that we have the aircraft flying and are working our way through that with the FAA, we can start to actually schedule demo flights.", "As you can imagine, the foreign customers are also very interested in this U.S. Air Force program because they like to see what the U.S. Air Force is doing. So I think that is a \u2013 I don\u2019t know if that helps or hurts, but certainly something that they\u2019re watching as well. But anyway, I would say, the international conversations continue.", "Ron Epstein", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hey, Gursky.", "Jason Gursky", "Scott, I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes on Kautex. Talk a little bit about some of the competitive dynamics going on in that market, and describe to us, perhaps based on new wins that you had there in 2016, what we might expect the growth rate at Kautex to be relative to the overall market. Certainly, the market is flat. What would Kautex do in that environment, given what you know about the wins that you had in 2016 and the legacy things that might be rolling off?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. Look, it usually takes a couple of years from the time between a new model win is announced and the time that, that manufacturer is going to roll that product down the line. So that translation from a selection to an SOP or start of production in the auto lingo is usually 2 to 2.5-year kind of window. So we have pretty good visibility into what they tell us, but do keep in mind that, that\u2019s based upon what their forecasts are and, in general, what the overall automotive industry forecast is for those units.", "Of course, that\u2019s true even for our current production rates. So there always a \u2013 as you compete for those deals, there\u2019s sort of a maximum number and then there\u2019s usually some percentage discounts applied in terms of how much capacity you want to allocate to it because they\u2019re going to have an ability to flex in terms of their order rates based on what the end market is doing.", "So all that being said, I think that if you look at where we are with Kautex, where we have been over the last few years and, certainly, where we expect to be over the next few years, given some new technology, given some of the conversion and FCR and things of that nature, we have tended to outgrow what the end market is doing, and I expect that we\u2019ll continue on that trend. So we will \u2013 I feel very comfortable that we can outgrow the overall industry. What we always have to have in terms of how we forecast is what is the overall industry doing. And if the industry has, in general, been growing, we see some volatility between regions at times.", "So far this year, I\u2019d say it\u2019s more or less operating the way we expected it, maybe a little bit of North American softness offset by a little higher growth in some other regions, but that\u2019s kind of normal for us. I mean when we look at our plan every year, there\u2019s usually a little bit of shifting back and forth between the regions, but it\u2019s still been a net growth. And again, our growth has been in excess of that of the industry. And again, based on the win rates and based on our products, I think that\u2019s a trend that will continue.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up \u2013 I may have missed it, but you talked about pricing for new jets. I was wondering if you might make a comment, if you haven\u2019t already, on the pricing environment in the used markets, what you\u2019re seeing from an inventory level, pricing of Citations out there in the markets. And if you can make some general comments about the pricing environment across the various segments of the business given the fact that your portfolio was expanding to cover some more segments here. Just kind of give us a flavor of what you\u2019re seeing in the used market, would be helpful, across the industry.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think \u2013 I mean, obviously, I\u2019ve spent more time looking at our particular numbers than some of the other classes. But our used available for sale has been a pretty flat, stable number now for a while. The pricing, for the most part, has been a pretty flat, stable number. If you look at sort of publications, you\u2019ll usually see that the \u2013 we have one model in particular, the Citation X, that has seen pricing pressure in the used market.", "But that\u2019s \u2013 I mean that\u2019s been true with that aircraft now for as long as I\u2019ve been around. For some reason, the pricing in the aftermarket for that one has been tough. But if you look across the rest of the core of our businesses, from CJs up to XLS and Sovereigns, it\u2019s been pretty stable, and certainly, that\u2019s generally what we see as we\u2019re selling aircraft from our used inventory.", "So I guess I would say that it\u2019s \u2013 I mean I\u2019d love to see prices going up in that segment. I don\u2019t think I could say they\u2019re going up in that segment, but the used market has been fairly stable. And I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t \u2013 I just don\u2019t track enough probably on the other classes of aircraft to give you much commentary on that.", "Operator", "And we can move to the next line. It would be George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "On aviation, Scott, you mentioned Scorpion was maybe 200 basis points and maybe about $19 million. Is the second quarter going to be relatively high and then will tail off so we get to the $50 million for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. That\u2019s what I would expect, George. We\u2019ve got the \u2013 as I said, we\u2019ve got \u2013 2 of the aircraft are flying. We have the third one that\u2019s in its sort of final assembly. There\u2019s a fair bit of work going on right now on the mission systems, which is very specific to what we know the Air Force is going to want to see demonstrated in their experimentation program. And obviously, all that culminated in having these aircraft ready to go do that program by the beginning of August, actually a little bit earlier than that because the program will require flight training for some of the Air Force pilots. So it\u2019s certainly been very heavy here in the first quarter. I would expect it to be pretty heavy in the second quarter and then tail off through the balance of the year.", "George Shapiro", "And how about other R&D? I know, last year, you said R&D was abnormally high because of Longitude expenses. How was the rest of the R&D this quarter compared to, say, last year\u2019s first quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. There was certainly a benefit if you look at \u2013 have you looked at the business without Scorpion in there, would have had a bit of a tailwind on the R&D front for exactly what you just said. We had a lot of spending. We had Longitude in a very similar situation last year at this time as we have with Scorpion right now. Obviously, that program was very heavy in the first half, got all the aircraft flying into the certification program. And we have three aircraft now on the Longitude program, but they\u2019re all flying. And it\u2019s kind of normal flight test type of expense that we certainly have gotten past the blows of R&D spending on that program.", "George Shapiro", "So would have been down $5 million, $10 million relative to last year, can you ballpark it for me?", "Scott Donnelly", "Somewhere in that range, George. But I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t break out business by business. But certainly, it would have been a slight tailwind to the business if we didn\u2019t have the Scorpion running.", "George Shapiro", "And then if I go to Industrial, where the margin was a little less than I was looking for. Can you break out how much of the impact was from Arctic Cat and how much was just from the restructuring to combine the couple of divisions that you talked about?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, on the order, we probably had about \u2013 somewhere around half of it was really associated with the costs that were incurred on the Arctic Cat front, and it was a little bit lighter quarter on the NOP front in a couple of other businesses. But again, nothing that was beyond what we have expected or expect certainly for the full year.", "George Shapiro", "And then at systems, Scott, if I take out the $24 million charge you mentioned, you would have had a margin over 10%. I mean, is that kind of a run rate or it will be a little bit lower because you still have higher deliveries of the zero margin TAPV?", "Scott Donnelly", "That\u2019s correct, George. Yes, we would have had, frankly, a great quarter in the systems business had it not been for the TAPV. I think the other businesses will continue to perform well through the balance of the year, but we are going to have a lot of revenue that\u2019s coming through with zero margin on TAPV for the balance of the year.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Those are my questions. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company.", "Justin Bergner", "Hi, thank you for taking my questions Scott and Frank. Just on the last question, you mentioned in Industrial that it was a little bit lighter quarter on \u2013 and you were referring to part of the business. I think I missed that.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we had some issues around some deliveries in other parts of our vehicle business. Frankly, the good news is some new product came out that was very well received, and we just couldn\u2019t build it fast enough. So that will move some things into the second quarter, but there\u2019s nothing fundamental issue there. It\u2019s a little bit of timing on that front. The rest of the business of tools and test of \u2013 was performing as we would expect. Kautex was where we expected. And again, with the exception of being a little bit light on some vehicle deliveries just based on getting production units out, I think we\u2019re fine.", "Justin Bergner", "Okay, great. And then, secondly, on your Textron Aviation revenue and margin guidance for the year that you gave at the start of the year, I mean, given that pricing is firming, are you expecting margins to potentially come in above the earlier range? Or is Textron Aviation not a source of sort of upside for your annual guidance at this point?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an upside source of guidance. I mean, obviously, we talked about in the latter part of last year what we had to do on the pricing front, and that\u2019s absolutely baked into our operating plan for the business.", "Justin Bergner", "Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. There\u2019s just two that I had still left. One was on King Air. Scott, you mentioned, despite of slow start, you think you could still reach the original plan. Could you remind us what the original plan was for King Air is year-on-year 2017?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, we don\u2019t guide at that level. But it\u2019s going to be roughly \u2013 I mean, our expectation is it\u2019s roughly flat year-over-year, is, I think, what we originally talked about. And that\u2019s still our expectation in terms of units.", "Myles Walton", "In terms of units, yes. And so \u2013 but your sales force, they kind of see this 1Q as being anomalous, and you mentioned the dollar strengthening. Is it competitive? Is it market? Or is it \u2013 competitive in the sense of they\u2019re finding competition at lower prices? Or is it that they\u2019re deferring the purchase because \u2013", "Scott Donnelly", "No. It\u2019s just generally deferring the purchase, which is \u2013 again, that\u2019s just kind of \u2013 that\u2019s part of the impact I think of how we saw some of the lower volumes as people say, well, geez, the dollar strengthened, so you need to lower the price. And \u2013 but we can\u2019t do that. So we\u2019d rather take the hit on some of the volume because these are deals that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a great aircraft. It\u2019s the right aircraft for the mission. And when people can afford the aircraft, even considering the strength of the dollar, I think they\u2019ll buy the aircraft. So I think it\u2019s largely deferrals of purchase decisions.", "Myles Walton", "And then could you just give us the data points for aftermarket growth for the Bell and the Cessna on a year-on-year basis?", "Scott Donnelly", "Bell was probably up very slightly, and actually, aviation was probably down very slightly.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for fitting me in.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning, Carter.", "Carter Copeland", "Just a couple of quick kind of cleanups here. On TAPV and TMLS, usually, these sorts of realizations are accompanied by changes in process, review process, leadership. Have you had any of that at TMLS? And then you talked last quarter about the 412 outlook at Bell in 2018 and beyond looking a little bit more healthy. Wondered if you could give us some color on that?", "Scott Donnelly", "So I would say, in the case of TMLS, yes. I mean there have been a number of changes operationally to try to address some talent issues around there, and so that\u2019s been done. On the 412 yes, look, we still \u2013 our sales teams still feels pretty bullish on a number of important 412 opportunities that are out there. Several units did close in the quarter, and we have a number of deals which are sort of multi-aircraft orders that are progressing well. As you know, the 412 is virtually exclusively an international product. So these things, particularly the extent that some are government involved, usually take a little bit longer than any of us would like, but they continue on the path to closure, and we still feel good about it.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, great. And with respect to the Latitude, one last one. The profit profile you saw there, essentially unchanged versus the end of last year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. Look, the volume that goes into NetJet is the same on a year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter basis, and I expect it to stay there sequentially and year-over-year. Based on the actions that we\u2019ve taken on Latitude pricing, we\u2019ve seen improvements.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay. All right, thank you gentlemen.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Noah Poponak", "Scott, do you think the Cessna book-to-bill will move above one as you move through 2017?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t know that it will. I think that we\u2019re really in a mode now where there\u2019s no reason for people to book aircraft very far in advance. So the \u2013 we usually, as we\u2019re working with somebody, kind of know when their delivery \u2013 when they want their delivery to be. They may have aircraft that\u2019s coming off lease or we have guys that want to go do their trade obviously, go to look to remarket their existing aircraft. But there\u2019s no reason, given the sort of where the industry is, to be looking at deals that are a year out or even six months out.", "So I think that\u2019s just the nature of where we are in the market. And again, Noah, it\u2019s different than the industry used to be, for sure, but we\u2019ve been doing this for a lot of years now, so it\u2019s just a bit of the nature of the beast.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes. I guess I was a little surprised that it was one in the quarter, given you\u2019re early \u2013 I guess, early in the process of trying to incrementally hold firmer on price. I would think that would sort of weaken the bookings. But was there firming of NetJets in the quarter that contributed to backlog?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it\u2019s just a subsequent quarter. So if you look at what we delivered in the quarter versus what got out of the backlog, there\u2019s not net change in terms of the NetJet deliveries. And look, I think on the dynamic of the sort of, let\u2019s call it, the retail booking of all of the aircraft, I think, as we went through the quarter, we certainly had some customers that said, look, as I \u2013 give me a little better price, I\u2019ll do it this quarter. I\u2019ll go ahead and book it now. And as I said, we can\u2019t do that. And so we\u2019re working with them, and so then deals do start to book at that higher price, which is where we need to be.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. So the amount of NetJets units that firmed and went into backlog was about the same as what was delivered?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. We\u2019re looking just to get and see if it\u2019s the exact number or not. But \u2013 so I mean, there \u2013 it might have been up a couple of units. As you know, the way we treat the NetJet stuff is once we\u2019ve identified the specific tail number, the specific delivery date, that\u2019s when we move them into the backlog. So again, these aircraft are coming into backlog and then delivering over a \u2013 it\u2019s probably six to nine month or so period.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. What are you seeing your competitors do as you incrementally hold the line on price? Are you seeing them do the same or not?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think it\u2019s been largely the same. Look, I think we \u2013 collectively, the industry has been a little unhealthy. That\u2019s certainly how we\u2019ve seen it, and I suspect they see it the same way. But I don\u2019t know, they\u2019re \u2013 obviously, they have to make their own calls in terms of the pricing environment. But I certainly would say that, as we work for the customers and explain what we\u2019re doing and then why we have to do it, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, they\u2019re unhappy, but they do realize these are \u2013 these aircraft are still a heck of a price compared to historicals and it\u2019s a good deal. And that\u2019s why we still see deals closing.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes, okay. And then just to make sure I\u2019m clear on the systems margin. Is it the correct interpretation that I should be thinking about that $24 million contract reset as going to zero in the second quarter and rest of the year and, therefore, the margin should be pretty even in the kind of 9% to 10% range each of the next three quarters to get you in the vicinity of your original 8.5% guidance.", "Scott Donnelly", "No. So I think you need to take that $24 million largely out of our guide number. And I mean \u2013 I would guess we can probably relook at that. We tend not to get into the revisions of segment-level guidance. But the color on it, Noah, is that we will certainly miss that segment-level guidance given that $24 million charge. I think we\u2019ll make up some of that $24 million within the other systems businesses, but some of it will be made up across the rest of the company.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. So as you look out of the original systems guidance, assuming you\u2019re outperforming a little bit in the rest of systems, outperforming a little bit in Bell and then getting a little tax rate.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. That\u2019s correct.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Drew Lipke", "Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I\u2019m curious in aviation. Do you have a sense if just the prospect for tax reform has caused customers to maybe take more of a wait-and-see approach on placing orders? Are you hearing any commentary on that through the sales channel?", "Scott Donnelly", "A little bit. But I think the tax \u2013 the specific tax impact of acquisition on aircraft, while \u2013 if you take view that says, hey you\u2019re going to get 100% deductibility on a capital acquisition like that, that certainly gives some incremental benefit in terms of the math behind that transaction, and so I think that would be beneficial. But I have to say the bigger issue here is not just the particular tax rate. Because, remember, under bonus depreciation, you\u2019re really talking about a two year window here anyway.", "So it is an improvement, but it\u2019s not a huge improvement. The issue for most of our customers is \u2013 the bigger issue is what kind of economic growth are we going to see in the country and, therefore, what\u2019s the outlook for the performance of their businesses. And so an overhaul of the tax system, a reduction of rates, the stimulus that, that would generate in terms of economic growth is the bigger factor for them, I think, than the particulars associated with the tax treatment of this particular transaction.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "And that\u2019s why they\u2019re kind of waiting what\u2019s really going to happen here in terms of tax reform and how does it play out from a legislative standpoint.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay. So you\u2019re seeing it in the sentiment and the confidence but not follow through yet in orders?", "Scott Donnelly", "Correct.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay. And then we\u2019ve seen some slowing trends pretty consistent in terms of utilization rates for Citation and for Beechcraft. How should we think about aftermarket trends in aviation over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we seem to be pretty flat in terms of utilization. Particularly as it \u2013 if you look at the average utilization rate, I would expect, as we go forward, given that we\u2019re starting to put \u2013 obviously, Latitudes now have been going into the NetJet fleet for coming up on a year. As we get into the latter part of the second quarter and to the third quarter, we\u2019ll start to see some growth in services associated with those, but obviously we also see some decrement associated with \u2013 from the other NetJet fleet.", "So it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think we see a reason for a whole lot of change here on the total year service side.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot. Thanks guys.", "Eric Salander", "Okay, Brad. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Welcome to the Textron Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead.", "Eric Salander", "Thanks, Greg and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I would like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release. On the call today we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up $93 million from last year\u2019s second quarter. During this year\u2019s second quarter, we recorded $13 million of pre-tax special charges, or $0.03 per share after-tax. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.60 per share, down $0.06 from last year\u2019s second quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $341 million compared to a use of cash of $26 million in last year\u2019s second quarter.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Eric and good morning everybody. 2.6% increase in second quarter revenues reflected growth in industrial and Bell. We continued strong performance of Bell in the second quarter with a 13.6% operating margin. Revenues were up on higher military volumes as we delivered 14 H-1s, up from 9 last year. V-22 deliveries were down from 4 in the current quarter versus 6 last year and 21 commercial helicopters compared to 24 in last year\u2019s second quarter.", "Commercial order flow continues to improve as we booked a number of significant orders in the quarter. We signed an agreement with Shaanxi Helicopter Company in China for 100 Bell 407 GXPs with deliveries expected to begin this year. We also received an FMS award for Bell for 4 412 VP helicopters that we will deliver in 2017. Our Bell 505 Jet Ranger X achieved FAA certification in the quarter, marking a significant milestone for the aircraft and we continue to see a strong conversion of orders. On the development side, our 525 Relentless program resumed the flight test activity earlier this month. We remain committed to this development program and anticipate certification of the aircraft in late 2018.", "Moving to systems, revenues were down slightly as ramping up TAPV deliveries were more than offset by lower weapons and unmanned systems deliveries. We also completed the final delivery in our Sensor Fuzed Weapon product line in the quarter. We are continuing our development efforts in the area of lightweight precision guided munitions and successfully test our Fury munition against moving targets from various unmanned aircraft systems, including our Shadow platform. At Paris Air Show, our unmanned systems business unveiled its next-generation platform with the Night Warden tactical unmanned aircraft system, with enhanced capabilities and runway independence. Our Textron Airborne Solutions business, ATAC, was awarded a $45 million ID/IQ contract modification in support of the Navy\u2019s Contracted Air Services program. We are continuing to see demand for government contracted adversarial services and see this business as a growth opportunity.", "Moving to industrial, we saw an 11% increase in the revenue, reflecting the impact of a full quarter of Arctic Cat. We continue to make progress with the integration of Arctic Cat as we begun consolidating operations and enhancing our dealer network. Also during the quarter, the Textron Off Road Stampede 4x4 was recognized as American Hunter\u2019s 2017 Vehicle of the Year. On the new product front, our EliTE Lithium powered golf car continues to gain momentum in the marketplace, with over 8,000 units delivered since its introduction earlier this year.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $25 million. We delivered 46 jets, up from 45 last year, 19 King Airs, down from 23, and 4 Beechcraft T-6 trainers compared to 11 last year. We continue to see improving pricing in the market, with higher overall pricing on new retail jet models year-to-date. Citation Longitude continues to make progress towards certification by year end as the fourth launch it was added to the flight test program. This is the first aircraft with a fully outfitted interior, which will also be used for customer demonstration flights. This aircraft is on display at eBase, where we also announced our first European longitude customer. On the military side, we are awarded an FMS contract for the Argentine Air Force with 4 Beechcraft T-6 aircraft, along with related maintenance and pilot training.", "Moving to Scorpion, we continue to prepare the production aircraft along with our Beechcraft T-6 for participation in the U.S. Air Force OA-X light attack experiment beginning in August of Hill Air Force Base. To sum up the quarter, we made significant progress on new products across our businesses and continued our efforts in recent acquisitions, all of which positioned us well for future growth. We also remained focused on inventory control and working capital management, which was evident by the continued improvement in our cash generation this year.", "Moving on to capital allocation, we repurchased 7 million shares year-to-date, which is consistent with our strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $295 million, down $33 million for the second quarter of 2016 and a $93 million increase in revenues.", "Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $25 million from this period last year, primarily due to lower military and commercial turboprop volume, partially offset by higher jet volume. Segment profit was $54 million, down from $81 million a year ago primarily as a result of the lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1 billion, approximately flat from the first quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were up $21 million due to higher H-1 program revenues, partially offset by lower V-22 revenues. Segment profit increased $31 million from the second quarter of 2016 reflecting improved performance. Backlog in the segment was $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter, down $234 million from the end of the first quarter. At Textron Systems, revenues were down $10 million primarily due to lower volumes in our weapons and sensors and unmanned systems product lines partially offset by higher volumes and Marine and Land Systems.", "Segment profit was down $18 million due to lower volume and mix. Backlog in the segment was $1.6 billion, down $170 million from the end of the first quarter. Industrial revenues increased $109 million largely due to the impact the Arctic Cat acquisition. Segment profit was down $17 million due to the operating loss at Arctic Cat, which was consistent with our integration plan and unfavorable pricing and inflation. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit decreased $2 million.", "Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $31 million flat with last year. Interest expense was $36 million essentially flat with last year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 28.8%. During the quarter, we recorded pre-tax special charges of $13 million. Through the second quarter of 2017, we have recognized pre-tax charges of $150 million under the restructuring plan that we announced last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3 million shares returning $143 million in cash to shareholders. The work we have been doing over the past several years to strengthen our balance sheet and our businesses was recognized earlier this month by Moody\u2019s with a credit rating upgrade to BAA2.", "To wrap up with guidance, we are reiterating our expected full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.60 per share exclusive of the Arctic Cat restructuring and deal costs and other ongoing restructuring efforts across the businesses. We also continue to expect cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $650 million to $750 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. And Greg, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jason Gursky", "Yes. Good morning, everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Jason Gursky", "I was wondering if you could just talk about the demand environment on the biz jet side from a geographic perspective kind of walk us around the world on what you are seeing this quarter and the visibility that you have here into the second half of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Jason. Look, I think on the business jet side, it\u2019s still very North American centric market. It\u2019s really \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen any particular dynamics changing over the course of the year and that\u2019s how we would envision of playing out for the balance of 2017. So, it\u2019s still very North American driven.", "Jason Gursky", "Okay. And any potential opening there in China, it looks like the helicopter market is improving a bit for you being driven by China maybe some commentary on the regulatory environment of the demand environment for biz jets in China specifically?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, sure. For sure, the helicopter market continues to be stronger in China. The deal with 100 407s, there is a great program for us. We do see the helicopter market remaining strong. But again, from a regulatory environment these are helicopters largely operate at lower altitudes. And there has been a lot more reform around aerospace and those lower altitudes has been up in the flight levels. So in terms of the jet businesses it\u2019s been still pretty weak. And I think part of it is \u2013 regulatory art of it has been the politics around business jets in China. And we certainly would expect that that will loosen up over time, but it remains pretty quiet.", "Jason Gursky", "Alright, great, okay. And then lastly on the 525, there is a couple of quarters ago where you suggested that the sales force was shifting its focus and its efforts moving [indiscernible] oil, gas market to other end markets that which you have get the aircraft back in flight task, can you update us on the current thinking with regard to the sales of 525 and where you expect the demand to be coming from and what the progress is looking like there? Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. This is \u2013 look this machine was designed as an aircraft that would be ideally suited to the oil and gas market. We still think it\u2019s a great oil and gas machine, obviously that market is in a very difficult spot right now. As oil prices have come a little bit, it\u2019s probably starting to get a little better. We have seen some activity in the later end into that segment, but still very, very weak. And as you know there is not a lot of equipment out there sort of on the sideline, so this is going to take some time from sort of the line between oil and gas recovering and absorption what\u2019s out there before you will see a lot of new aircraft orders I think. But we continue to talk to those customers. They still are very much in our focus. There is still a lot of interest around 525 for that market. But the timing is still to be determined. In the meantime we certainly are continuing to look at the VVIP market, governments troop transport and other sort of utility applications for aircraft of that performance envelope. So we are surely not dropping our focus on the oil and gas customers, it\u2019s \u2013 but the timing will be an issue, so we still are working hard at those other markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much and good morning. I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the industrial business and it looks like we started off the year with expectations for organic growth maybe in the close to 5% range and there have been some currency headwinds year-to-date, but it seems to be a little bit shorter that so far, so can we talk about the dynamics in the different businesses and what you expect in the second half?", "Scott Donnelly", "So I think if you look at the constituent parts obviously automotive right now is more flattish, so there is a little bit of difference regionally, North American auto is down a bit. so I think getting any kind of significant growth on the topics side right now was probably unlikely just given the nature of what\u2019s going in the automotive segment. The business is still performing well, I think our execution in terms of manufacturing operations and key measures like scrap and operational efficiencies and up-time are all positive so we are seeing good performance from the business, but we are not going to see a lot of top line growth in the current automotive environment. Around the vehicle side of the business, I think that for the most part our order rates are good and in the quarter of what we have had both in golf and our ground support equipment businesses and the industrial equipment product lines. So I don\u2019t think there is anything out of the ordinary there. Obviously, mostly growth is driven by the Arctic Cat deal and our focus there continues to be as we talked about really moving a lot of the older inventory out of the channel, that\u2019s going very well, frankly. And really at this point focused on getting new products and getting those launched and getting the dealer channel setup to take on a lot of new product and that will be our focus through the balance of the year.", "Seth Seifman", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Noah Poponak", "Scott, just in the overall business share market you sort of started the strategy a couple of quarters ago to kind of incrementally hold the line on price and then immediately post-election there at least you were asked a lot about policy changes potentially improving demand, so maybe you can just update us on both of those on the former what\u2019s the market receptivity been and are your competitors doing the same and then I guess just with both are either changing demand it\u2019s kind of looks like they are not, but just wanted to get your feel on both of those items?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think that we are as we have talked about we are increasing our price that we are realizing out there in the marketplace. We continue to do that and we continue to do that in the second quarter, so we are seeing improved pricing versus where we were last year when we said sort of said hey guys enough is enough, we need to start getting some price back into the market. For sure there was some mix out there of customers that are waiting to see some movement on the government side, from a tax standpoint which I think largely people feel would help to stimulate the economy and drive some GDP and improve their business outlook, which would give them more confidence to do capital expenditures on things across the whole business including business jets. So I think there is are still little bit of reservation around that, obviously it\u2019s a relatively flattish market. So I think we are being successful on the price front. We are certainly willing to do that at the expense of some volume and there are certainly some customers who are holding out and that\u2019s fine we are not going to give back on the pricing front, I think it\u2019s moving in the right direction. We need to continue to do more. But I think in general no other demand environment around the business jet side is relatively flat. Frankly, that\u2019s is the biggest drag for us right now around volume is really on the turboprops and a lot of that as you know is more international business. So between economies and exchange rates and all these kind of things that has continued to put some pressure on both Caravan and the King Air product lines, so both of those models are down on a year-over-year basis in terms of volumes. So we are going to \u2013 that\u2019s just the nature of the international market, so I don\u2019t think we need to change our strategy, we will keep selling hard. But we would like to see those markets coming around a little bit obviously. The other thing that\u2019s obviously drag for us on the margin side is that we are down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis on our T6s which is a great product line on the multi-side for us. Hopefully we will see \u2013 I think we should see a little bit of up-tick here in the third and fourth quarter versus the first half of the year, but it is certainly going to be down quite a bit on a \u201816 to \u201817 basis and that was baked into our guidance obviously.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. So what was both the Scorpion spend in the quarter relative to that full year $50 million?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we don\u2019t breakout specifically the spending on it. I would say it was \u2013 we always said it would be considerably higher in the first half and the second half and that will be true. We have had a very high level of activity here in Q2 as we finished the first couple of production aircraft, we got them flying and are now in the process of doing ordinance work and as we are all being prepared to have aircraft of ready for the experimental flight test program on beginning of August. And those aircraft are built, they are ready, so I would certainly expect that what we forecasted this year ramped down and Scorpion spending in the back half of the year will be true.", "Noah Poponak", "So if I just kind of guess at a rough layout of that it would look like you need to be, well, I guess on a reported basis you need to be about 9% aviation margin to get to the 7 that you start of the year targeting and maybe 9.5 to get to the 8x Scorpion, am I hearing you correctly that you are maybe looking at being a little bit lighter that based on what\u2019s happened on the military and the prop side?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. I would say right now I would forecast that on being the lighter side. And again primarily driven by the fact that we are \u2013 I would expect we are going to be lighter on the turboprops, particularly the King Air and the Caravan than we would have expected. We are not \u2013 we have to see how the back half of the year plays out, but certainly we are going into the back half of the year with a lot more turboprop volume requirement than we would had in our plan.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Sam Pearlstein", "I was wondering if you could go back on Bell and you called out the continuing strength on the commercial side, can you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s giving you that confidence, just because I am looking, we certainly see the weakness in oil and gas and oil and gas prices, is it simply the China order, just trying to get a little bit more around that please?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sam, I think it\u2019s much broader than that. I mean obviously the China order was grate for the 407, but we have seen strengthening just on normal sort of one-off order flow on 407. We see continued strength in our 429 product line. And again these are not fleets deals, just good flow of activity and orders closing on the 429 program as well as 412s, so the 412 order book continues to strengthen. There are still a couple deals out there that need to close through the balance of the year that we would expect to have happened that are sort of in negotiation. But it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 505 obviously is, we\u2019re going to resort it in a \u201cas best as we can make and we will ship them scenario,\u201d but that is not a whole a lot of dollars per aircraft, obviously. But I would say that when you look at our portfolio of the 505, 407, 429, 412, it\u2019s \u2013 the order booking has strengthened across all those models and a broad range of applications, everything from military application to VVIP, EMS, search and rescue. It\u2019s pretty strong across the board.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And is the backlog declined sequentially than all on the military side?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. And that\u2019s mostly normal for us, Sam, right. I mean, when we know that we don\u2019t put the V-22s on the multiyear in until that year\u2019s funding is appropriated, so we usually have this sort of cyclical backlog that happens largely driven by that.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And then also on Bell, just the strong margin this quarter, can you talk a little bit about what EACs were versus just the richer mix just in terms of the moving pieces to get that margin?", "Scott Donnelly", "The EACs are reported sort of companywide, so I do not think we will go into in a lot of detail there. But we had positive performance and \u2013 but it\u2019s not as huge going on a year-over-year basis in terms of the numbers. It\u2019s just \u2013 our kind of the teams continues to have good, solid performance. Obviously, getting some additional volume on the H-1s in quarter was helpful. But the guys are doing a good job controlling cost and executing well and getting product delivered.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And I am sorry, one last question, the Canadian TAPV, I know it\u2019s not in Bell, but just the Canadian TAPV, any change in kind of your outlook after taking that adjustment back in the first quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Not really, Sam, and will continue to be a challenging program. The good news is, our deliveries in the quarter were kind of double from where they were in the first quarter. We continue to have \u2013 our slights on sort of finishing the majority of that program this year with, obviously, a little bit going into the second half of next year, but \u2013 which is still a challenging program, but we are getting it behind us.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Pete Skibitski", "Yes. Hey, Scott. I wonder if you could go further on architect integration in terms of how that\u2019s going and kind of give us a line for return to profit there. And I am not \u2013 and one variable that goes along with that, and I am not sure about it, I was wondering if there is kind of a long-term purchase intangibles that you have that\u2019s going to be kind of a drag on the GAAP profit for a while?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, really I think the integration so far is going well. I think we are through that first vertical few months, so we are getting the team through all the organizational changes and all the things that sort of go with a major acquisition. Everybody, I think, at this point is focused on their primary jobs and getting the work done. Job one, as we talked about, was running programs to try to clear out a lot of the aged inventory that was out there in the channel, and we ran out that pretty hard, and I think we have seen a lot of success in doing that and creating room for floor plan for these guys as we bring out and start to launch new product. We will have a lot of integration in the launch a lot of new products here as we get into latter part of August into September. On the dirt side, I think the snow product launches, which happened right before we completed the acquisition, have gone well. So snow bookings have been good. And the dirt process is one where we are integrating across so that we really look like the same company across everything from ATV through all the side-by-sides and up through the high-performance products. So I think we are in fairly good shape. We needed to do around organization. We have made all of our announcements in terms of what we are doing in terms of operational restructuring and aligning our production facilities. Obviously, and as Frank said, part of our plan here, it is losing money right now, which was part of our plan. We are running at low manufacturing rates, which, again, is consistent with our strategy to sort of bleed down a lot of that inventory that is out there and then start the reloading process with new product here as we get into the latter part of the year. So everything that we said we were going to go do is what we are in the processor of doing, and I think we are fine. There is nothing from intangibles or\u2026", "Frank Connor", "I mean, there is some drag associated with intangible amortization in the number broadcast that we gave, which was kind of the $0.10 dilution for the year, as Scott said, given the lower volumes and that accretive into \u201818, now includes all of the M&A accounted for.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes. So I think the guidance that we gave around, our anticipated dilution this year is, is going to be about what we thought it was, and it should become accretive as we go into 2018.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay, great. I appreciate that. One quick follow-up of a little surprise, you had the final Sensor Fuzed Weapon delivery this quarter and didn\u2019t hit double-digit margin at systems. Is that the impact of TAPV being zero margins? And I think you said you could hit 8.5% on the full year at systems, is that still possible?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I don\u2019t think that is possible, Pete. There is no question this TAPV issue has been a problem. As I said, the bulk of that, I think, has already been recognized, obviously, but it is going to put a driver on the total year systems number for sure.", "Pete Skibitski", "Okay, got it. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes, thank you very much. So I think at the first \u2013 after the first quarter, you indicated that total aviation R&D like was going to be down in the second quarter. Can you comment as to whether it was? And were there any other issues that we should be aware of, like used aircraft losses were higher, lower, anything like that?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, the delta is, in both the R&D front and the used aircraft loss you were negligible. I think\u2026", "Cai von Rumohr", "Negligible versus the first quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was up very, very slightly and negligible versus the year-over-year comparison. So the dynamic is going on with respect to the margin we\u2019ve guided is largely driven around the fact that no \u2013 as we talked about in the jet slide, were pressured because of the little bit higher mix around our net jet deliveries and the fact that we were down pretty appreciable on the turbo front for both the Caravan and King Air on the commercial side as well as the T-6 on the military side. The T-6, we fully expected. That was baked into our plan. All of the numbers around R&D so far have been essentially what\u2019s baked into our plan. The pressure point really for us has been around the lower volumes on the King Air and the [indiscernible] what\u2019s kind of pressuring us from a planned perspective.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes, the R&D, the aviation was up in the second quarter versus the first quarter, right? I think you said it was up like $7 million or $8 million year to year. By my numbers, the R&D has to come down very sharply in the third and fourth. Is that a \u2013 sequentially, is that kind of the way things go?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I expect it will come down and largely driven by the fact that we have got the bulk of the work around the Scorpion program behind us. So, we will obviously do some continued spending as we work our way in both the certification flight test program and the Air Force experimentation program, but it will certainly be down sequentially.", "Cai von Rumohr", "And then you talked of improved pricing. On the Q1 call, you talked of improved pricing sequentially on all models. Give us some more color on what does improved pricing mean.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, improved pricing, if we look at everything, because what we disclose is on a year-over-year basis. For most models, we were also seeing continued sequential pricing. There are some exceptions in there, which is why I would be careful that \u2013 for instance, on Mustang. Mustang pricing was down sequentially, and that\u2019s largely because we stopped production of that aircraft, and we had the last aircraft that we were selling, and so we did do some additional discounting to move those last aircraft. Now the good news is that is done. We have sold the last of the production Mustang, so that would not be a factor for the balance of the year. But the teams are continuing to see progress on the pricing front and I expect we will through the balance of the year, and we are will to trade volume to make that be true.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Terrific. Last one. Bell margin, given the huge margin you had in the second quarter, can you beat the 11% Bell we have set out in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I think so, Cai. If we were to lay out sort of just color around that thing, I think Bell was continuing to have a strong year and are executing well in the military programs. We are seeing some strength on the commercial side, obviously, which is good. I think there will be upside there that will help to cover some pressure around where we are with systems, particularly with the TMOS business, it\u2019s still a little bit to be determined as you are around backyard volumes on the aviation business.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Maybe one for you, Frank, on cash flow. First half is pretty darn good in terms of free cash of manufacturing. Just looking at the seasonal pattern historically: a, I\u2019m not sure you ever had second quarter inventory goes down; and b, it looks like it will at or above the top end of the range from a guidance perspective. Can you give some color around that?", "Frank Connor", "Sure. Yes, now that look the seasonal pattern, which certainly suggest will be stronger in the second half. We continue to believe that. CapEx will be heavier in the second half. So it is a little back-end loaded. Obviously, as Scott indicated kind of we continue to see kind of volume that we need to move out there. So, it\u2019s kind of a little early to be kind of changing our guidance, but certainly, we think we have given the strong first half performance. We think we have upside on the cash side.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. And then one quick one on rev rec standard adoption in \u201818?", "Frank Connor", "Yes.", "Myles Walton", "Is Bell the one we should think about, because the V-22 volume would decline in \u201819 from a delivery perspective, but I guess you might accelerate some of that decline in \u201818, if you go to TSA?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I mean, look it impacts Bell. It impacts systems. It impacts kind of frankly top line net revenue versus gross revenue in some of our other businesses, but we are still working through kind of all of that, but we don\u2019t expect it to be have a material impact when you look at the corporation.", "Myles Walton", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thanks a lot. Hi. Just my first question on industrial, just wondered if there was any update on that sort of $400 million to $500 million sales guide for the year in Arctic CAT and also I guess what was the actual EBIT impacting Q2 from that acquisition?", "Scott Donnelly", "I\u2019m sorry Julian, I don\u2019t have that number in front of me and we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not going to go into EBIT at the individual sort of sub-segment level. But I was sufficed to say that in terms of how the business is performing, it\u2019s performing consistent with our plan.", "Julian Mitchell", "Understood. Okay. And then just following up on the cash flow question, I guess, if you think about the components within that full year guidance 650, 750. What sort of working capital assumption is dialed into that given the way you stand now?", "Scott Donnelly", "I am not sure I understand how to answer the question, Julian. I think from our operational working capital standpoint, we are pretty confident where we are the issue, which I think was what kind of Frank was saying is that when we look at the total year perspective, while we are certainly, I think it\u2019s going very, very well so far. We would expect it to go very well for the balance of the year. The issue will be around, I think, particularly sales volume at aviation, which would be finished goods. If we decide that we are not getting priced and we are good in trade volume. So operationally, I think I am not concerned, it\u2019s a question of what the volume is going to be in the second half on aviation.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. And then my last one would just be on the King Air side, did the second quarter there play out largely as you thought. I mean the declines were a bit less than in the first quarter and you still think there is a reasonable chance you can get to sort of flattish deliveries for the year as a whole in King Airs or is the first half is sort of too lower bar for that to happen?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, the second quarter was certainly better than the first quarter with respect to our expectations and our plan of unit volumes, but we certainly need to see a pretty significant uptick in demand in Q3, Q4 and I don\u2019t \u2013 we will see how the market plays out, Julian, but you are right, what we were off of what we would have liked to say our plan was more in the first quarter than the second, but we do need to see a material increase in volume here in Q3, Q4 to get to where we would like to be on King Airs.", "Julian Mitchell", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Just following up on the last question with regards to King Airs, Scott, do you think it\u2019s \u2013 just trying to gauge whether you think this is a shorter term issue where it might be international weakness or do you think its longer term where you are seeing cannibalization from the light trucks coming in and eating up King Air demand?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, I think it\u2019s really the dynamic, Sheila, is more around just international markets are still \u2013 are still kind of tough. And our exchange rates obviously are quite strong. And it\u2019s making the product more expensive and we are not willing to take price out of there to sort of compensate for that. And so we are kind of holding the line on that. Again, remember this is a market where we have a product that\u2019s very popular product to a certain product and we just kind of have to hold the line with it. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a cannibalization particularly in the international marketplace, the King Air performance envelope and the mission that it fulfills is pretty unique. And I think we will be fine over the long-haul, but we need to hold the line here in the near-term.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Okay, that makes sense. And then if I could follow-up on the Scorpion and just the OA-X flight testing in August. I mean, could you just elaborate more on the process and sort of what you expect with ideal scenario for Textron coming out of it?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, as the Air Force has articulated, the experimentation program will really put these aircraft through their pace as they have got a bunch of different mission scenarios that includes from flight envelope, a lot of different mission scenarios, ordinance missions that are going to be run over the course of that August maybe in the beginning of September. And so they don\u2019t have a specific criteria or pass, fail, they just \u2013 they want to see what the aircraft are capable of. Obviously, you have things like Scorpion and then AT-6 which are both very, very capable platforms, very different in terms of their performance envelope and they want to see what each of those aircraft can do as well as A-29, which we expect is also in there. So, it really is no \u2013 it\u2019s unusual, it\u2019s not a matter, hey, guys, you got to go do X or Y or Z or here is the past, they want to see what the aircraft are capable of. So that would be the first step in a process here and as the Air Force has said that will kind of inform them as to what they think their next step is.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "In regard to systems and defense overall, can you provide some color on the puts and takes around growth next year and what we should be focusing on. You talked about the TAPV and what\u2019s going on there by putting that aside?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I don\u2019t know \u2013 obviously we are not quite ready to get into guidance for next year in terms of dynamics just mentioned particularly around TAPV and Ship-to-Shore Connector, which have been some of those more challenging points of the \u2013 of the systems business. We will have most of TAPV behind us, which is good. So I have certainly seen improved year in that regard and we expect that volume to largely be replaced by other vehicle programs, which historically have been normal good margin programs for us. So, we certainly see significant change in margin rate on a year-over-year basis there. Ship-to-Shore Connector, which again has been a multiyear fixed price development program, which has always been a difficult margin program, is going to be converting and starting to transition into production. We are in the process of negotiating long lead material and in the initial production units. So again from a year-over-year basis, I think particularly around the TMLS business, which has been a challenge for us MLP here in the last couple years frankly, we should see that business transitioning from fixed price development and a difficult fixed price development and production program into more typical margin programs going forward.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Excellent. On free cash flow given the comments you made earlier about inventory control and capital management, how are you thinking about conversion going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, no differently. It\u2019s where we should be converting cash kind of bit under one times, depends on CapEx levels and spending levels and deposit activity and things like that. So there is volatility to it. But we have been focused on kind of better working capital management and that\u2019s what we are seeing, but no change in longer time expectations.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Right. Thanks for your time.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.", "Peter Arment", "Yes, thanks. Good morning, Scott and Frank.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter Arment", "Hey, just quick one Scott on following back on Scorpion, I know obviously, the experimental programs, the most important thing here near-term, but was there any incremental takeaways from discussions in Paris, I mean seeing the aircraft over there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I would say from a Paris perspective, we continue to get good exposure from potential foreign customers, which has always been a key focus on the Scorpion program. I think that the aircraft especially now that we have the production versions available which is something that a number of the prospective customers have wanted to see. We continue those dialogues. Some are kind of watching and waiting to see a little bit what happens with the Air Force experimentation program and others continue to have more specific discussions with us around when they want to come over, when they want to fly the aircraft and are laying in some cases their own plans and budgets in place for the program. So I would say Paris was positive. But again, we really are very focused on experimentation program because I think that not only the will the U.S. Air Force get a good read on the capability of the platform, but I think a number of our perspective international customers are likewise on watching to see how the programs goes.", "Peter Arment", "That\u2019s great. And then just two quick ones Frank, just housekeeping on the stock buyback what\u2019s left on your availability for that and then also what\u2019s the expectations of the tax rate for the years I think last that was around 30%?", "Frank Connor", "Yes. I think we have got about 20 million shares or so left on the authorization, but we will just redo the authorizations as required, so there is no real \u2013 there is no limitation relative to authorizations really because that\u2019s a continuing thing that we look at. And tax rates should be around 28.5% for the year. So we will be a little better than where we had originally guided.", "Peter Arment", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Drew Lipke from Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Drew Lipke", "Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Drew Lipke", "I guess first question is on longitude, can you update us on where we stand as far as potential order activity there and then when you look at just kind of level of competition in the super midsize segment I mean how confident are you in your ability to hit the margin goal for the program as we stand today?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we are pretty confident. The aircraft is flying really well from a performance standpoint in terms of the things our customer look at around range and useful load and speed we have a better aircraft and other aircraft that are in that segment today. So I think that as we talk to customers about the aircraft and accumulate a lot of information around the flight testing, it\u2019s all very positive. I think people are very enthusiastic and we just \u2013 keep in mind, we just built the first one that really has a nice real aircraft with the real customer interior and are just entering into the phase where customers will get a chance to actually fly in the aircraft on demo flights. So we do have \u2013 we have already have some order activity, but you wouldn\u2019t expect at this point to see a whole lot of that until people can actually fly the aircraft. And that\u2019s the phase that we are entering into at this point. So I think we will do well. I think it\u2019s again from a performance and pricing standpoint I think we are in a good place and we will see how it plays through the balance of the year.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay. And then just jumping over to Scorpion, two questions on that, I mean on the one hand you have got key members of the Air Force testifying consistently stating publicly that the OA-X program is the strategic priority and you have got Senate Armed Service Committee dedicating $1.2 billion, but on the other hand if you look Air Force\u2019s unfunded priorities list, there is no mention whatsoever of the program, so I am curious what do you think of it, how do you kind of reconcile those two and what your take in the criticality of the program and then just also that the $2 billion of light attack for that Saudi package, do you believe that\u2019s dependent on the OA-X program and what do you think your odds are there for that the Saudi piece?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, so I guess what I would say is part of the U.S. Air Force concern, remember that where they are in this process is an experimentation program. So I think the chief and a lot of very senior people Air Force have been articulating the need for a platform like this. And they feel that it\u2019s important to the Air Force to have the capability like this, but it would be hard for them I think even on an unfunded list to advocate for something that they haven\u2019t flown and seen demonstrated. So I think that their interest and desire on the program and certainly as you know the Senate Armed Services for instance saying what we have recognized this is a need and we want to put budget authority in there for it. We also can\u2019t get the problem worse here. I think the Air Force is being pragmatic about the fact that they need to execute experimentation program, understand what the capability is of the platforms that they are looking at and then take their next step, whatever that might be. So I think from a process standpoint they are doing it an appropriate fashion, it will be very hard for the Chief to say how I am going to advocate for something that I haven\u2019t flown and don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s capable of doing. So slightly that\u2019s kind of where that the processes is on Air Force side. In terms of the Saudi budget item around OA-X, obviously this is one of the customers that we are in discussions with, but these are early on discussions. There are certainly a number of things that we are looking at, but we think that now the performance envelope, the capability of what Scorpion can do makes it a very viable product for what their requirement is, but it\u2019s still in its formulative stages I would say.", "Drew Lipke", "Great. Thanks.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Good morning. I wanted a clarification on Scorpion R&D Scott, it would seem to me like the Scorpion R&D was maybe up $5 million or so in the second quarter relative to the first quarter as opposed to the expectation it was going to be down a little bit, is that fair?", "Scott Donnelly", "George, we don\u2019t \u2013 obviously, we don\u2019t breakout R&D in the individual businesses and certainly by product line, but without any numbers to it, in other words a significant amount of spending around Scorpion in the quarter. It was pretty comparable where it was in the first quarter, I mean the \u2013 we really have talked more about first half, second half around scorpion, because of the balance of work that we had to get going here in the first couple of quarters. But so there is no material change from where we would have expected it to be, but we still have to believe you will certainly see less spending as we go into the back half of the year.", "George Shapiro", "And may Frank, first quarter you disclosed in the Q that there was $11 million pricing benefit at aviation, can you disclose what it was this quarter or we got to wait for the Q?", "Frank Connor", "No, we had some positive pricing. But we will wait for the Q.", "George Shapiro", "And then aftermarket relatively flat or up a little in the quarter?", "Frank Connor", "Flat.", "George Shapiro", "And then Scott, just in general you say that the demand is kind of like what you have been expecting so far in aviation, but we got a book to bill of one, business jet cycles have been going up, used planes as a percentage of fleet keep coming down, you are getting better pricing, so I mean what else does it take to get you to be slightly more positive on where the cycles go on?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think just more demand, George. It\u2019s \u2013 I do think the business jet market in terms of where we expected to be is about where we are with these, right. I mean we are trying to get some pricing out there and we are succeeding with that. We have to succeed with that. I think that we would feel better about a prospect or if we did see some something around tax reform what people felt better about their businesses and therefore more likely to spend CapEx. But the business jet market is largely where we expected to be. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much better or worse. I think there could be some upside if we get some tax stuff done. The thing that\u2019s creating more of a drag or kind of what you are watching more closely is really around more of the total box side, which is a different dynamic as we talked about being a more international market for the Caravan or the King Airs, but I think the business jet side is performing as we expected.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ronald Epstein", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Ronald Epstein", "How is the aftermarket been doing for Textron Aviation, broadly speaking when you think about spare parts and training services as a whole non-OEPs of the business, how is that growing?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s pretty flat on a year-over-year basis.", "Ronald Epstein", "And what do you think is causing that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we haven\u2019t had a dramatic change in the fleet size obviously. I would say you are not seeing the kind of install base grow. I mean your \u2013 our relative level of deliveries is flat or below what\u2019s been here in the past decade certainly. And you see lot older aircraft that start aren\u2019t being pulling that much. So there is no at a macro level there is nothing to drive a whole lot of additional service when your installed base really isn\u2019t changing dramatically.", "Ronald Epstein", "Yes. So I mean when we think about what\u2019s been going on in the mid-to-late business jet markets, I guess to some extent even that the largest or even worst more recently, strategically when you think about the portfolio Scott, I mean when does the time will start doing some portfolio repositioning?", "Scott Donnelly", "We come around the aviation side?", "Ronald Epstein", "Just in general, right. I mean here we are how many years, 8 years past the financial crisis and biz jets aren\u2019t growing again. And I mean when \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say when you are throwing the towel, but when do you start thinking about different bigger likes of the business, something like that to bolster growth?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look without getting I mean obviously if we had something in the M&A world but we were \u2013 on the road of journey, we would kind of talk more about that. I don\u2019t think there is anything on the near horizon that we would have any conversation. I think when you look at each of the individual businesses, aviation is probably, perhaps, our best example right now is that we were trying to focus our R&D dollars in expansion of our portfolio within that business, right. So when you look at it not only going into the single-engine turboprop space, as you look at longitude and then hemisphere going up into those classes of aircraft where we have not been, we are trying to focus our R&D spending in those spaces that will give us net growth, right? So Scorpion certainly falls into that category. So most of the money, virtually all the money right now that we are spending is in products that will be adds to that portfolio; which are not, we are going to take away from existing with aircraft sales, because they are in a different class of aircraft than what we have had in the past. So, I mean that is our strategy organically to do that in the aviation business. Obviously, the same is true in the Bell Helicopter businesses. If you look at the 525, which is the biggest Bell we have ever done. When you look at the 505, which we are started to realize some of the benefits going back into the light helicopter side, where we have not been for a number of years; obviously, we got the V-280s and V-247s to expand the portfolio into a very large part of the military market. When you look at the vehicle business, expanding more into the consumer side, so again, I \u2013 I think, from an investment standpoint, I think where we are focusing our R&D dollars organically across our businesses is principally in expanding beyond the portfolios that we have historically served to try to drive growth even in a flattish environment. Now, obviously, if we can get some tailwind in the aviation side, or that\u2019s all good for us, but we need to be spending our money in places that will drive long-term growth by expanding the rest of those product lines.", "Ronald Epstein", "Yes. And then maybe one more just sort of smaller business, but I thought it was intriguing. When you had a us all down in Georgia and we were visiting the facilities down there, the aircrafts or what I call airport ramp mobile infrastructure business, right, with the DI service and TUG and Douglas and other, how is that business going? I mean, are you seeing growth there? And is there more to do there because that seems like an interesting niche?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure. Look, it has been \u2013 the acquisition that we started TUG a few years ago has gone extremely well. The deal went as we expected from a just integration standpoint. The growth of the business has been strong. We have added deicing side with Premier and then with Safeaero last year, and we continue to look at what would be likely smaller deals and we still kind of hunt around that area. We like it. We have a good position there today, I think a very good reputation with customers across that market and certainly that scenario that we would continue to look at things where we could expand because the ground support role has been a \u2013 it was a great acquisition for us and that continues to perform well on organic basis as we introduce more products into that space.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay. Yes, cool. Thank you so much.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "I just had a couple of follow-ups. Were margins up or down year-over-year in just the pure jet original equipment piece of aviation? So ex Beech, ex prop, ex aftermarket, ex R&D, just the Cessna jet OEPs?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, obviously, we don\u2019t provide that, Noah, but we did talk just from a color standpoint of about one of the pressures being higher mix of net jet latitudes. And that does put some pressure on margin rates. On the other hand, we have some positive around, trying to dig as we have improved our pricing. That is on the beneficial side. So the bulk of the pressures obviously is more around the lack of the turboprops, but we have been challenged, and as you know, we will continue to be challenged around the mix associated with higher net jet deliveries.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. Yes, okay, maybe should have even asked that ex that. I am just trying to better understand margins is going\u2026", "Scott Donnelly", "I will just send you our gross margin by aircraft, and then we would not have a question. ", "Noah Poponak", "Well, there would still be a good half a dozen airplanes in that question and it\u2019s an upper-or-down question. I was just trying to understand, because pricing getting better but margins going down as tough to square, although obviously the prop and the military mix stuff\u2026", "Scott Donnelly", "As described, Noah, the prop and the military is the primary driver. When you look at our equipment sales, that\u2019s just difficult. Those are great products for us, and if I look this as issue, obviously, the military is a separate discussion. But when you look at the Caravan and the King Airs, we are trying to maintain the prices up there. We need to keep these as fair profitable products. And that\u2019s you are going to see, you have seen and you would continue to see lower volumes, because we are going try to hold a line there.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. And then just one more, I know you mentioned maybe some upside to the full year plan for the Bell margin, but I wanted to just maybe better understand what drove it to be so strong in the quarter in an effort to better understand what\u2019s sustainable versus what was purely specific to the quarter. And it kind of looks like each one having five extra units, if I were just to super rough math, assume they are $25 million a copy and a 25% incremental margin, that would kind of get you right to what the year-over-year EBIT change was, the $30 million bucks. So is that directionally correct that it was mostly H-1 mix or is there some cost savings in there that is sustainable going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "It is a combination of both. Obviously, the H-1 volume is helpful to us, but we also had good cost control and overall business performance. But yes, there were some big one-time sitting in there.", "Frank Connor", "And, Noah, on the military side, you need to think about incremental margin coming through at a NAF margin, not a gross margin level, just the way the accounting works and the accumulation of cost into inventories that area.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay, so that would be \u2013 so what I said would be much too high?", "Frank Connor", "Yes.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay. And then so that would imply something like half of it was just sort of savings in performance, okay. Yes, that\u2019s really helpful. Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions.", "Frank Connor", "Terrific.", "Eric Salander", "Thank you. That concludes our call. We will see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference is being recorded.", "At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Salander. Please go ahead, sir.", "Eric Salander", "Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and also in today\u2019s press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were $3.5 billion, up $233 million from last year\u2019s third quarter. During this year\u2019s third quarter, we recorded $25 million of pre-tax special charges, or $0.05 per share after-tax. Excluding these items, adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.65 per share, up $0.04 from last year\u2019s third quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $279 million, up from $94 million in last year\u2019s third quarter.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up 7% in the quarter, reflecting strong commercial demand at Bell, increased deliveries at Textron Systems and higher revenues in Industrial due to the acquisition of Arctic Cat. We saw strong execution at Bell again in the third quarter with a 13.1% operating margin, revenues were up on higher commercial volumes as we delivered 39 commercial helicopters, up from 25 in last year\u2019s third quarter, 8 H-1\u2019s, flat with last year, and 5 V-22\u2019s, down from six last year.", "We delivered five 412s in the quarter related to the improved order flow we\u2019ve seen over the past year. We also began deliveries of 407GXP to Shaanxi Energy Group in China on the order of 100 units that we announced earlier this year. Also during the quarter, we received an order for eight 407GXPs from Caverton Helicopters, which included Bell\u2019s Customer Advantage Plan support solutions for each of the aircraft.", "Moving to military, we delivered our first two FMS H-1 aircraft for Pakistan in the quarter. On the development side, our V-280 Valor successfully achieved ground one testing at 100% RPM and remains on track for first flight this year. Our progress on this program was on full display at AUSA last week, where we featured a video of this achievement along with our full-size V-280 mockup.", "Our investment in this program aligns well with the Army\u2019s stated objective to accelerate product development and realize one of its key modernization priorities future vertical lift.", "Moving to Systems, revenues were up on higher TAPV deliveries. At TRU, we delivered six full flight simulators in the quarter as we continue to grow this business. In Unmanned Systems, we were awarded an FMS contract in Bulgaria, marking our first international system sale of our Aerosonde platform. In our Textron Airborne Solutions business, we acquired a fleet Mirage F1s in support of future adversary air contract competitions.", "Moving to industrial, we saw an 18% increase in revenues, primarily reflecting the impact of Arctic Cat. Overall margins were down, largely reflecting the diluted impact of the Arctic Cat acquisition and unfavorable volume and mix in other business. At Arctic Cat, we\u2019re continuing to execute to our integration plan and we remain on track for the business to be accretive in earnings in 2018.", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were down $44 million, as we delivered 41 jets flat with last year, 24 King Airs, down from 29 and 5 Beechcraft T-6 trainers compared to eight last year. We saw stronger international King Air and Caravan deliveries in the quarter, as compared to the first-half of the year. We recently received an additional order from Babcock Scandinavian Air Ambulance for 10 King Air 250s and the first medevac-configured Citation Latitude for deliveries beginning in 2018.", "This past week at NBAA, we celebrated the delivery of the 100 Citation Latitude, the best-selling midsize aircraft in the market today, achieving this milestone in just 26 months following entry into service. Also at the show, we displayed our first production Longitude aircraft with a fully fitted interior. Following the show, this aircraft embarked on a 46C demonstration tour as we look to begin deliveries in 2018.", "Moving to Textron Aviation Offense, our Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine Aircraft, both performed extremely well during the U.S. Air Force\u2019s recent OA-X light attack demonstration program. And to sum up the quarter, we achieved top line growth and continued our strong cash performance, while furthering our business development efforts on new products across the businesses.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was $295 million, down $15 million from the third quarter of 2016 and a $233 million increase in revenue.", "Let\u2019s review how each of the segments contributed starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues were down $44 million from this period last year. Segment profit was $93 million, down from $100 million a year ago, primarily as a result of unfavorable performance and lower volume and mix, partially offset by a favorable impact from pricing. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $142 million from the second quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were up $78 million due to higher commercial deliveries. Segment profit increased $9 million from the third quarter in 2016, primarily reflecting a favorable impact from performance and other. Backlog in the segment was $5 billion at the end of the quarter, down $413 million from the end of the second quarter.", "At Textron Systems, revenues were up $45 million, primarily due to higher volumes at Marine and Land Systems, partially offset by lower volume in the Weapons and Sensors product line.", "Segment profit was down $4 million. Backlog in the segment was $1.5 billion, down $85 million from the end of the second quarter. Industrial revenues increased $156 million, largely due to the impact of the Arctic Cat acquisition. Segment profit was down $17 million due to unfavorable volume and mix, pricing and inflation. Finance segment revenues decreased $2 million and profit increased $4 million.", "Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were $30 million, down from $53 million last year, largely related to the transfer of the Scorpion program to Textron Aviation. Interest expense was $37 million, up from $35 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 was 21.7%, included a net discrete tax benefit of $15 million, largely related to state income taxes.", "During the quarter, we recorded pre-tax special charges of $25 million. Year-to-date 2017, we have recognized pre-tax charges of $42 million under the restructuring plans that we announced last year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares, returning $122 million in cash to shareholders. We also took the opportunity to issue 300 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 3 and 3%ish and used the proceeds for a voluntary contribution to our pension plans.", "To wrap up, we\u2019re updating our adjusted full-year EPS from continuing operations guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. We are also increasing our expected full-year manufacturing cash flow from continuing operations before pension contributions by $150 million to a range of $800 million to $900 million, with expected pension contributions of about $355 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So, Tony, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hi, good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Just on the cash, sorry, the EPS guidance tightening of $0.10, can you maybe talk about where it\u2019s coming? And if it is the industrial business, just what\u2019s going on within the profitability there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, sure. I think there\u2019s two things that are contributing to sort of going towards the lower-half of our original guidance. And the first is, obviously, as you know, in the first quarter, we did take a charge associated with the TAPV program. So, the business overall has performed to our plan for the balance of the year. We expect it to perform to the balance of the year. But that charge in the first quarter is some that\u2019s basically flowing through the full-year overall compared to our original guidance in that segment.", "And then on the industrial side, look, I think, we had a fairly tough quarter in industrial, particularly in our vehicle business. The Arctic Cat work is going well, but we have thrown a lot of resources, particularly people at making sure that integration goes well. And frankly, we got a little behind on some of the rest of the business in terms of line rates and production output. As we worked our way through the quarter and as we go here and in the beginning of the fourth quarter, it looks like most of the line rates are back up to where we need them to be, we\u2019re not likely to be able to catch up on some of the miss from Q3.", "And so I think if you look at those two dynamics, obviously, those I think coming in stronger than the guide Aviation a little bit lighter, again, primarily driven by some lower volume that we originally expected. But those two sort of offsets or the two things that are driving really at this point are the TAPV charge we took in Q1 and just a little bit lighter volume and conversion on the vehicle business.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "All right. Thank you. And then just one more, if I may, on the backlog. Within aviation, it was up slightly. Could that be attributed to the Longitude? And then just on that program, how do we think about the ramp up and entry into service?", "Scott Donnelly", "So it\u2019s not really driven by Longitude, Sheila. So I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t kind of do it model by model. But it really is across other aircraft platforms, which I think is good. The Longitude, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a lot of backlog going into that until we start getting that production aircraft out there and a lot of people have seen the aircraft and are interested in the aircraft. But now coming out of NBAA, where we have the first customer fitted out version, as I noted in the remarks, it\u2019s going to be flying around here for the rest of the year doing demonstration flights for perspective customers. And hopefully, we will start to see some backlog build as a result of that, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "And just on the entry into service?", "Scott Donnelly", "Oh, entry into service, I think, it\u2019s probably going to be early next year. The flight test program is going extraordinarily well. The aircraft is performing beautifully. We had one of our key suppliers that has some obsolescence issues. And we decided that it was \u2013 it made sense to incorporate the latest and greatest new product before we went through the certification program. That\u2019s taken us probably a couple of months longer than we were originally have liked it to, we\u2019ll push off until probably early next year, but no material impact. So we certainly expect to see solid deliveries in 2018.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Carter Copeland", "Just a couple of quick ones. One, Scott, I wondered if you could expand on the industrial commentary. It looks like maybe the shortfall there was sort of $25 million relative to the plan. And you \u2013 I know, you called out unfavorable volume and mix and then additional resources and people on the integration. How much should we think is each of those and how of much that is sort of temporary versus things we got to watch out for in the future?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, on the resources piece of it, the piece specifically around Arctic Cat, frankly is going to plan. We\u2019re very happy with how that\u2019s proceedings, the inventory levels that we knew we needed to drive down in the dealer base or happening retail sales are up considerably. There\u2019s obviously a lot of work going on and aligning the product lines and getting dealers up to speed on the full range of both what was in Arctic Cat, as well as what was under development in the Textron vehicle business.", "So I think, that\u2019s all progressing, the factories are up and running. There are a lot of moving parts here, Carter. We decided to move our engine manufacturing facility from Germany into the St. Cloud facility. So we\u2019re kind of centralizing all of our engine manufacturing, which is also obviously much closer to the final assembling plant in Thief River. We did move all of our dirt manufacturing out of Augusta up to Thief River, which I think is already starting to pay dividends. So, these are all things, I think, bode well for the future of the business. But they were costs some, a lot of work and distraction for the people to go pull that stuff off.", "In terms of the core of the business, as I said, we got a little behind in terms of line rates and nothing particularly magical, just getting our production control and logistics programs running. We have a new facility now down in Augusta, where we\u2019re consolidating all the Jacobsen things. So there\u2019s just a lot of moving parts that had impacts really across the rest of the core business.", "So, as I said, I think those line rate as we watch them here going into the quarter are getting back to where they need to be. There\u2019s still some things to work on, but I think this is something we\u2019ll have behind us as we hit into 2018. And clearly, we expect the Arctic Cat deal, it\u2019s up to be accretive as we go into 2018. So certainly, a misstep. A lot going on in that business between the Jacobsen integration, bringing in Arctic Cat, a lot of internal moves, which again, we think are the right answers in terms of driving better productivity and better margins as we go forward, but certainly impact here in the quarter.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay. Thanks for that color. And one for Frank. Frank, was there a tax benefit of $100 million or so from the pension prefunding that we should think about?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, on a cash basis, so cash tax basis, we will get a deduction for that contribution. The bulk of that will fall into this year. We\u2019ll get some of that benefit into next year. So it\u2019s spread between the two years.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, great. Thanks, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "George Shapiro", "I wanted to pursue, Scott, you were saying in aviation, you had some unfavorable performance if you could provide a little more color on that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I \u2013 clearly, George, the numbers if you look year-over-year, we do have all the Scorpion spend in there. So when you look at relative performance from last quarter to this quarter, I think that \u2013 or third quarter to third quarter, the team actually did pretty well when you consider the margin rates that were delivered even with the increased spending. We still had a lot of activity going on with Scorpion and 86, frankly, as we went through this experimentation program.", "We continue to have a very high spend as we\u2019re continuing in trying to finalize the Longitude certification. So on a cost base nothing really beyond what we would expect. I think the guys did a pretty good job on that. We are a little bit light, probably to volume, where we would have liked it particularly around the turboprops although they were considerably stronger than they were in the first couple of quarter.", "So we\u2019re encouraged by what we saw on the market on both the King Airs and the Caravans now seeing stronger international demand which were important to both those platforms, but all-in-all still a little bit lighter and like I think part of that\u2019s the market and part of that is what we continue to work on the pricing side, George and we are continuing to hold the line on making sure we are getting priced in the business, we saw that, you guys will see when the Q comes out, it\u2019s falling around $22 million year-over-year, so it\u2019s a line that\u2019s obviously tough to hold that line in the market, but we are doing that and I think that\u2019s going to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to trade that versus some volume.", "George Shapiro", "And Scorpion R&D, as Scott you had said on the second quarter would come down a little bit, this quarter it doesn\u2019t look like it did maybe, but if you could explain around that and how much we might expect for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it did come down somewhat, George, and it will come down pretty significantly here in the fourth quarter, now I think the fermentation program is done.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, and if I take a look at latitude Scott, you said you delivered a 100, but if I add up all your deliveries through the year, I get about 93, I mean is that seven already in the fourth quarter, if you can reconcile the difference for me?", "Scott Donnelly", "George, you probably have better data than I do on that then, I thought it was a 100 through the end of the third quarter was the number I was referencing, but we\u2019ll probably have to maybe have an offline call with you and try to reconcile our database and your database first, but the number should be a 100 through the end of Q3.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, and then one last one on industrial, I mean you had guided earlier to a margin of 9% and with the dilution it came down to 7%, I mean what does it look like now for the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it\u2019s going to be lower than that obviously, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re probably prepared to give a specific number, but it\u2019s going to be\u2026", "Frank Connor", "A bit lower than that.", "Scott Donnelly", "\u2026a bit lower than that.", "George Shapiro", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question in queue is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much and good morning. Scott, I wonder if you could talk about the hemisphere program, we had the announcement of the delay on the Silvercrest engine and the source says that all options around on the table as far as that goes, how do we think about the future of this program from your point of view and how you are thinking about approaching the development next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, that\u2019s a good question. We just learned about the issue on the Silvercrest compressor, kind of with everybody else at NBAA. We\u2019re obviously in discussions with their team to understand and in fact as they determine, I think this is still a relatively early on in terms of their understanding of what the problem is and they are still doing the work of exploring what the range of options might be to solve the problem. So it\u2019s probably premature to really know what that impact could be, it could be a minor impact, it could be a more significant impact, we just \u2013 we don\u2019t know enough yet. All we\u2019re really familiar with is sort of how it manifests itself, it certainly sounds like a high pressure compressor issue, which is exactly what they are describing I think that we need to give their engineering team a little of time here to figure out again what that range of options is.", "We have continued to work on hemisphere obviously with our customers and doing a lot of our ergonomic work in modeling and supplier selections and all those kind of key things which need to continue to happen. So we are running that at a rate appropriate to that and I think we\u2019ll keep doing that and then based on where the Silvercrest is, obviously we can regulate you know what we do in terms of a program span based upon that.", "Seth Seifman", "Great, thanks. And then maybe one more for Frank, it looks like you are on track this year for about $68 million of pension expense. If the year ended today and we think about the contribution you just made, how do we think about the impact of the contribution on next year\u2019s pension expense possibly offset by the \u2013 or probably offset by the additional debt that you took on?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, well, I mean obviously a lot will depend on interest rates at the end of the year and returns and so on for this year. At a simplistically level if you think about kind of the 7.5% rate of return that has been our return assumption and look at the 3.375% cost of the debt, kind of that spread differential with some other kind of \u2013 there are some other impacts, but is generally ballpark type of impact having to do just with the contribution.", "I\u2019d say, overall from a pension standpoint, as we talked about before, we think as we move into 2018, again, there\u2019s a lot still to be learned about where things are set, but we should get a little bit of a tailwind associated with pension.", "Seth Seifman", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question in queue comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Jon Raviv", "Hey, good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi.", "Jon Raviv", "On Bell, can you just go into a little bit more on the nature of the commercial positivity. What sort of end markets is that coming from, or is a lot of it is related to those larger deals you\u2019ve signed over the past year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think, it\u2019s, I mean, the activity we\u2019re seeing is pretty broad-based. So you do have deals out there that are fleet deals like some smaller oil and gas kind of guys, but there\u2019s a fair bit of yet in executive transport going on. There\u2019s a pretty broad range of EMS activity.", "There\u2019s some foreign military whether it be border petrol, customs, police. It\u2019s not concentrated in any one particular area, which is good frankly, right. I mean we don\u2019t see just one sector, it\u2019s some life across most of the areas, and it\u2019s pretty broad-based geographically as well. So we\u2019re seeing activity in Southeast Asia, we\u2019re seeing it in Africa, we\u2019re seeing in South America. So it\u2019s a fairly broad-based. Again, we don\u2019t want to basically, I think, the overall market is still weaker than it has been in previous times, but it\u2019s much better than it was couple of years ago. And I think, our team is doing pretty well from a competitive standpoint.", "We\u2019re seeing again, strength in pretty much all the models, obviously, 505 is a brand new as they come out. But sales are being good on 47s, 429s, 412. So it\u2019s pretty much across the breadth of our platform and then do a pretty broad-based range of geographies and end applications.", "Jon Raviv", "Thanks for that color. And then speaking at Bell, the thinking about the margin strength this year, you laid out what\u2019s going on there and some of the good performance? What\u2019s the opportunity to hold on to that kind of profitability as 505 ramps up perhaps as 525 spending as the level of spending picks back up again. Can you give us some sense of how those things trend going forward?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, like usually \u2013 we\u2019ve usually talked about that business being able to perform in that 10% to 12% kind of a range. Although I think 13 is sustainable over a long period of time is a pretty tough part, okay? I mean, obviously, the guys have done really well this year to drive productivity and efficiency. And yet there obviously, we had a good mix with some strong 412 deliveries this quarter as well. So I\u2019d say, 13 is too strong, but it\u2019s going to remain a good healthy margin business.", "Jon Raviv", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just my first question on the Aviation, King Air has had a tough time, I think, on your volume delivery profile for about 18 months now, still light in Q3. Just wondered how you\u2019re thinking about, if you still think second-half deliveries can be flattish in aggregate for those, and how you\u2019re seeing overall kind of order and inquiry levels if that\u2019s giving you any optimism for the outlook for the next year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Julian, I think that, first of all, you\u2019re right, both the King Airs, which are generally speaking have a pretty strong international marketplace. I think over the last 18 months have felt a lot of the pain of a very strong dollar and weaker economies and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been experiencing. Again, I think, the good news here is that in the third quarter, while it\u2019s not what we delivered a year ago was certainly a lot more inquiries and a lot more sales and order activity than we\u2019ve seen for a while. So that bodes well, I think.", "Do I think we get the flat for the balance of the year? No, probably not. But I do think, given the level of inquiry and activity that it\u2019s going to be stronger than it has been in the first-half of the year. So definitely we\u2019ll finish the year here with a stronger King Air performance we saw in the first-half.", "And again, it\u2019s to look into next year is pretty premature at this stage of the game, given the nature of how things orders and sales convert. But we\u2019re certainly happier with the level of activity in the marketplace right now than what we saw for the past year, let\u2019s say.", "Julian Mitchell", "Thank you. And then my second question around the cash flow very good performance year-to-date on working capital, particularly versus the same period in 2016. I just wanted to clarify if all of the cash flow guidance increase was tax-related or some of that was due to working capital as well? And then maybe any color you could give on how the introduction of the Longitude should impact your working capital from here over the next six months or so?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure, Julian. Well, look, as Frank said, we do get some cash tax benefit here in the year. But most of this is driven by better performance in terms of just manufacturing cash flow and a big chunk of that is in fact working capital. As you know, you look at the number, we\u2019re \u2013 we generally just the natural cyclicality of our businesses is that you usually see the working capital burn off through the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re at a point this year, where we\u2019re basically kind of where we started the year.", "So we\u2019ve had a \u2013 the teams have done a much better job on working capital management. And by the way that includes some pressure points like ramping up Longitude. So we are already in producing aircraft, which obviously won\u2019t sell until next year. So, but despite that, when you look across the businesses, we already have working capital back to sort of neutral in the year. And obviously, we\u2019ll expect a considerable burn down here as we go through our normal cycle in the fourth quarter. Obviously, net working capital come down further.", "So the majority of it is the team delivering better manufacturing cash flow and that big chunk of that obviously is a working capital.", "Julian Mitchell", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Ledley", "Hi, this is Bill Ledley on for Cai this morning. Wanted to go back to aviation a little bit and book-to-bill was 1.1. And you mentioned some favorable pricing. So could you perhaps call out, what\u2019s stronger both from a volume and pricing standpoint? Is it biz jets or King Airs? If you\u2019d give some more color there, that would be great?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go sort of model by model. But we\u2019re \u2013 the market in general has been flattish, which is kind of what we expected on the jet side of things. I think, that the pricing activities are obviously helping and we continue to hold the line on that.", "And as I said earlier on the call, we will trade volume to price. We just \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with some of the increases that we have, but it\u2019s \u2013 the price levels are still, in my view, too low to look at the amount of investment that goes into producing these aircraft and designing these aircraft. And so we\u2019re going to continue to push on the price obviously as we go forward as well, and if that means some lower volume then we\u2019ll take some more volume.", "Bill Ledley", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the time.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Scott, coming back to Bell, can you talk about the government side of the business. And what are going to be the big drivers there over the next, say 12 to 24 months before submitting new products get rolled in?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, look, over the next year or so, V-22 is a relatively flat number in general. We expect H-1 to be up a little bit. Again, as we continue some FMS activity as we\u2019ve seen with Pakistan this quarter that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there will be huge shifts going on there, Rajeev, it\u2019s going to be probably mostly up on H-1 and relatively flat on V-22, program performance is good. I would expect that to be a fairly stable part of Bell here in the next couple of years.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Thanks. And then moving over to the industrial side. Once push Arctic Cat aside, what\u2019s going to be the driver there as we look forward to kind of a similar question?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, if you look beyond Arctic Cat, that\u2019s the core of the business that we used to have. I think, we\u2019re doing well in most of that segment. I think, if you look into Gulf place, these are new products with the lithium-ion batteries are doing very well in the marketplace. Frankly, it\u2019s a new product launch, it\u2019s gone extremely well.", "We continue to see strength in the what was the target market in terms of GSE. We actually had, continue to have strong order rates there. We\u2019ve got make sure we can line our production and get the deliveries and the output out, but the market in terms of order activity is very strong. And again, the rest of that market, I think, is in good shape. Most of getting deliveries and whatnot are \u2013 for us during the quarter was a matter of getting our lines up and running and getting to higher rates.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Excellent. A quick housekeeping question for Frank. Frank, what\u2019s the tax rate benefit in \u2013 for the year on the earnings?", "Frank Connor", "Tax rate benefit, I mean, the \u2013 well, I guess, we \u2013 given the tax rate of this quarter and year-to-date, we\u2019re looking at kind of 26.5% or so full-year tax rate. There is no tax benefit from a rate standpoint associated with a pension contribution, if that\u2019s part of the question. It only impacts cash taxes. It\u2019s actually a little bit of a headwind from a book tax standpoint just given some other deductions and things.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.", "Peter Skibitski", "Yes, good morning, guys. Hey, Scott, I think you touched on this last quarter. But can you remind us, again, why the ramp on the 505 is going so slowly? Is that, you had a lot of LOIs last I checked. So is it converting to LOIs, or is it execution at Bell?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, it\u2019s just ramping the production. It\u2019s getting the certifications outside the U.S. and getting the other certification. So there\u2019s nothing significant going on there, I mean, or different than we would really expect the LOI conversion rates are very high. So we\u2019re not concerned about that. The order book is certainly there and the ramp is coming along.", "Peter Skibitski", "Okay. And then can you just give us an update on kind of where we go from here on Scorpion?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think, in general here, the Air Force in terms of its experimentation program has been frankly very transparent, very open about how they saw this whole thing playing out. Dates and activities and what not were exactly as advertised. I think, the program went very well. We were obviously thrilled with how the aircraft did.", "We had very good feedback from Air Force pilots that flew both the Scorpion and the AT-6. And the Air Force is also very clear through the whole process that, once they finish the experimentation program, they were going to sort of take all that information and then determine what their next steps might be. And I think that\u2019s the phase they\u2019re in. So we\u2019re sort of standing by, while they decide what it \u2013 or the next steps on either or all aircraft and how they want to move forward. So I think, we\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re doing that and we\u2019re just kind of standing by and see how it plays out.", "Peter Skibitski", "Do you still need to wait for some sort of surge from them to get an international sale?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, we don\u2019t. I mean, I think, from an international standpoint, Peter, as we talk to customers and continue to have interaction with customers, there are certainly some that would want to see this thing have a U.S. certification or a worthiness declaration of some kind in our other customers that don\u2019t, as a military aircraft, that\u2019s not necessary. So, you definitely see differences in different countries and their approach to this. But there are certainly some that we\u2019re engaged in for whom a U.S. Air Force airworthiness certification is not required.", "Peter Skibitski", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question that will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Just wanted to follow-up in terms of, we talked about the Bell margin before, but just on the aviation margin, given your 5.6% kind of through the nine months would seem like it\u2019s going to be a challenge to get to your original plan of the 7% to 8%. Can you just talk about how we should think about the year? I know Scorpion R&D is supposed to be falling, which is how should we be thinking about the remainder of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "So, in terms of the R&D, it\u2019s obviously going to ramp down here. Over the course of year internal Scorpion, the activities are pretty well wrapped up. We\u2019ll have a little bit of activity going on with some international customer demonstration flights and some things of that nature, but it will be a relatively small number. In terms of the overall Aviation segment number, as I said earlier on, I think, it will be lighter them what we were originally guiding.", "Obviously, the guide included the Scorpion spend, but I think we\u2019re going to be probably a couple of hundred million dollars under \u2013 from a revenue standpoint, but we\u2019re seeing that through the course of the year, right, with particularly around the King Airs and the Caravans, and again, we continue to push on the pricing front across all these platforms. So we\u2019ll probably be a little bit lighter on revenue than we were anticipating in our original guide.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And just in terms of pricing, I mean, what are you seeing in the marketplace now, obviously, you\u2019re trying to hold the line, lots of others, it sounds like there\u2019s still plenty of price discounting. Have you seen just any overall change in the trend within the marketplace?", "Scott Donnelly", "All right. I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know how to comment on that. Any way other than to say, we still feel like we\u2019re winning our share of the deals that are out there. We\u2019re just holding the line on trying to be responsible in terms of what we need to do as a business. And is there any difference or change in what the other guy are doing? I can\u2019t really speak to that nothing that has jump to the forefront. But I think our share is still strong and I think customers understand that there\u2019s still pricing aircraft way below where it was historically.", "I mean, it\u2019s a problem, and I think people appreciate. We\u2019re investing a ton of money in the business on things like Latitudes and Longitudes and Denalis and they are \u2013 at these margin rates, so that I think the team \u2013 guys are doing a good job. And you need to have better margin rates in a business like this to be able to sustain the level of investment is good for our customers. So, we\u2019re going to continue to hold the line on it.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. And then if I can just follow one last question up on terms of the Arctic Cat and the integration. You talked about the distraction maybe impacting some of the production. But have you seen any success in moving your product into their distribution channel and anything from the going forward side that\u2019s that showing improvement?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, I think we have. In the retail, sales have been strong on a year-over-year basis. Some of that is clearing out a lot of the older inventory. But as we\u2019ve been getting the dealers together and now being able to go into those dealers and bring not only what they may have had historically from Arctic Cat, but adding some of the Textron Off Road product, name the Stampede, you may have seen we just announced the Prowler EV.", "So, we\u2019re obviously integrating these \u2013 the branding in the \u2013 at the product level and some of the technology that we bring into the EV side, as those products are rolling out. They\u2019re doing well in the marketplace, and so we\u2019re seeing dealers pick these up and we\u2019re seeing retail sell-through.", "So, it\u2019s still early, obviously. It\u2019s a lot of work to go through and change \u2013 now the good news is, it\u2019s a good change for them. It\u2019s a much better product line. It\u2019s a stronger product line. But I think it\u2019s being well received and there we feel good about where it\u2019s heading.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Noah Poponak", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Scott Donnelly", "Good morning.", "Frank Connor", "Hey, Scott.", "Noah Poponak", "Scott, I guess, just kind of big picture top down on the business jet at market. Some of the leading indicator data has improved, flight hour growth has accelerated, used inventories come down a little bit recently, especially the youngest batch in that bucket of used inventory. But I hear you call \u2013 still calling at a flat market that\u2019s kind of how it felt at NBAA. You had a little bit of sequential growth in backlog, but it sounds like turboprop got better and that never quite sure what\u2019s happening with your \u2013 the movement of fractional into that, and maybe that helped out a little bit too? So it \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I guess, sort of what\u2019s the remaining disconnect between some of this leading indicator data and having a more definitively robust business jet market?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, that\u2019s the million dollar question, so\u2026", "Noah Poponak", "I asked it.", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, let me, look, I can give you color on a couple of things. So first of all and towards the backlog, again, we don\u2019t really go into model by model or customer by customer here. But there\u2019s no material impact on the fractional thing, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the way we tend to work with net jets, which is obviously our big customer in that space.", "We\u2019re basically because of how we sort of look at the timeline of deliveries with net jets, it\u2019s sort of more or less deliveries in a quarter equals the amount of aircraft we\u2019re adding back into the backlog, because it\u2019s pretty steady flow of aircraft.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "So from a backlog standpoint, that\u2019s not a material change. In terms of, are we seeing that activity in the market in terms of utilization rates being up? Absolutely, I mean, I think, we had a good quarter in our \u2013 in the aftermarket business, and some of that, maybe there\u2019s a little bit of pent-up demand in there. But as you see increased flying that usually translates to increased activity in terms of the service side of our business, and we certainly saw that in the quarter, which is good.", "I think in the end market, look, your statistics are all correct, right, I mean used does continue to come down. I think they are \u2013 we still struggle with this notion that used aircraft pricing doesn\u2019t seem to want to move up, right and so that does pressure customers because the trading values and the step-up to new aircraft is more challenging when these guys have low residual values and despite the fact that used aircraft availability has dropped significantly over the last ex number of years, we are not seeing that reflect in used aircraft pricing. So, that dynamic I think is still one that weighs on people and it\u2019s a nontrivial economic impact to them.", "So, look, I think as we move on a lot of guys out there are flying older aircraft, they are seeing higher maintenance costs and they do want to step up and look, the challenge for us is that we can\u2019t make up for the lower residual value of the used aircraft by lowering the value of our new aircraft, okay so that\u2019s still a pressure point right. People want us to try to make up for that low residual value and I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t do that and maintain any kind of reasonable margin and return in the business. So I think the demand is going to be out there and \u2013 but again we haven\u2019t seen, I would love to see, we obviously don\u2019t control those, we would love to see residual values of used aircraft coming up and that would take some pressure off these customers, but look that\u2019s not something we control and it\u2019s a little perplexing to us as you see tightening \u2013 when the market tightens up for those used aircraft, why you are not seeing some lift in the pricing, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet.", "Noah Poponak", "To me, when I look at that chart on a long-run basis, it has come down recently and it\u2019s been on a steady decline over the last several years, but it\u2019s still on an absolute basis much higher than it was in any point all of last cycle and so it just \u2013 it leaves me wondering if, yes, there\u2019s been a tightening, but on an absolute basis it\u2019s just still too high and there are still too many options in the used market and that\u2019s why pricing hasn\u2019t firmed up there? I mean is that a reasonable assumption and you just have to burn it back to where it was 10 years ago or 12 years ago before you get that better pricing?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think there is a dynamic \u2013 first of all, it\u2019s a much bigger market, right, so the number of aircraft that are in the fleet is much higher and so therefore with similar percents we are going to have for sure more aircraft that are out there and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part the dynamic. You know I don\u2019t \u2013 to think that we could get to where used available was in that 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic, I mean it was a distortion the other way, right. People were selling used aircraft little more than new aircraft because you get one, it was a \u2013 so I think that people have to kind of get their head out of that, that\u2019s where the world is going.", "I mean these aircraft do depreciate, right. There is going to be a depreciation over a period of time, it\u2019s not going to be an asset that appreciates, which is what we saw in that, say, 2002-2003 through 2008 timeframe, I think that was a probably as I said a distortion in the other direction, so. But anyway, look, that\u2019s \u2013 I think that is a dynamic now when you look at what people will have an aircraft and what the reality is of what that aircraft is worth as a used aircraft. But the good news is, there is a big market for those, the liquidity in the market is quite high, right, people are turning aircraft, people are buying aircraft, that\u2019s not \u2013 this is not like it was when we were kind of in the dark days where there is an illiquid market and nobody was buying them. So there\u2019s a lot of transactions that\u2019s not hard to move used aircraft, people just have to get comfortable with that the reality of how these things depreciate and what that residual value is over time is different than it was if you went back into the early 2000s.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. On that industrial margin, so for it to be slightly less than the seven you had previously been forecasting for the year would imply basically kind of stepping back up into the sort of seven handle vicinity in the fourth quarter, so it sounds like that 3Q number was fairly anomalous, is that the right interpretation?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes, so I think all we were saying earlier and I was like, I think we\u2019ll get things back on track here in the quarter, but I don\u2019t see a way to make up for the NOP loss that we had from our plan in Q3 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of rolling that three to four year guidance.", "Noah Poponak", "Yes, just trying to understand the run rate given the differential between the quarter and where you kind of had been?", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes and I think it\u2019s fair to say that our run rate should get back up to a normalized rate in Q4.", "Noah Poponak", "Okay and then lastly, Frank when you were asked about tax rate, understanding there is no P&L tax benefit from what you did with pension, but there was a much lower tax rate in the quarter on the P&L. It sounds like you\u2019re saying the new earnings guidance, P&L earnings guidance has a 26.5% tax rate in it and the prior range coming into today had a 28.5% rate in it, is that accurate?", "Frank Connor", "Yes, basically roll through this quarters lower rate kind of to the full year just that type of impact, so kind of 29%, 30%-ish fourth quarter is where we sit right now.", "Noah Poponak", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much, good morning. Frank or Scott whichever one of you want to take this, you were both making comments about pricing in aviation and how you want to get better pricing, better margins going forward, and you be prepared to sacrificing volume. When volumes stabilize and since you are trying to get higher, what sort of incremental margin you think we should be expecting given this more robust stance on price?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Rob\u2026", "Eric Salander", "Hi, Eric Salander here, so a lot of things going on here, just in terms of the investment in the business and R&D and what not, which obviously is quite higher this year than it was \u2013 last year was \u2013 being in there, so you can\u2019t do the usual sort of quarter-over-quarter similar volume and expect what kind of a number.", "Obviously as we always talked about in the business when we really do get similar mix, which again is a significant issue here that we expect kind of 20% margin conversion, we\u2019ve been obviously pressured by achieving that number based on a couple things, one is obviously we had higher R&D as we\u2019ve put the Scorpion into the business and we\u2019ve had a pretty challenging mix thing as we talked about beginning of the year, we\u2019ve seen reductions on the turboprop side, including our military turboprop, which are our good margin business and we\u2019ve seen a lot of our increase this year has been around the latitude.", "Now the good news is the latitude as we look year-over-year based on the pricing actions that we\u2019ve been taking and cost actions and we are getting better margins, but they are dilutive to that overall 20% number, so the mix here has been a challenge, but on a normal \u2013 in a normal world, in terms of similar mix and whatnot, we would expect to see kind of those 20% numbers.", "Robert Stallard", "And presumably, heading into 2018 should be the case with longitude coming in, latitude being a like for like comp thinking on that?", "Eric Salander", "Well, we will always have the first \u2013 hopefully a relatively small number of longitudes that are going to be more challenging, because they are the initial production units, but yes, as we get probably more towards the back of the year and you get production stable and kind of get real run rates going, yes, that would true.", "Robert Stallard", "Okay, and then secondly on the cash front, does this pension contribution remove any potential contributions into the future and if that\u2019s the case, what are you going to use that additional cash flow for in terms of returns?", "Frank Connor", "So it certainly helps negate any contributions, so as you look at it today kind of barring some significant market events, yes it pushes things out so that we wouldn\u2019t expect additional required contributions other than our non-funded plans. And obviously as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize kind of use of cash the same way we have which is continuing obviously to invest organically which is just R&D and things like that. Obviously capital for the business in terms of excess cash, we\u2019ll return that to shareholder through share repurchase and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. Obviously we continued to buy stock in this past quarter and we\u2019ll continue that return of capital as we proceed forward.", "Robert Stallard", "That\u2019s great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Peter Arment", "Thanks, Good morning Scott and Frank. Just a quick one, as all my questions asked. On the 525, the flight test program there, how do we think about the impact on kind of margins as we get into 2018? Is it something that ramps up materially or is it something that gets fairly linear and absorb throughout the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think I mean the 525 specifically, obviously we\u2019re are back in flight test, things are going well, that will ramp up here as we get more aircraft back in the air through the balance of next year that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s factored into our overall R&D numbers, Peter. And again, given where the program is, it sort of has peaked, I think in terms of its R&D consumption and obviously we\u2019re going through a flight test program here for the next year or so.", "So that will be baked into our plans into our guidance, I don\u2019t see it having a material impact one way or the other. You won\u2019t start to see deliveries of that aircraft really until 2019. So in terms of any mix issue I would not expect to see that in 2018.", "Peter Arment", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up, on Scorpion you mentioned that you might not have to have a certification if you do some international. But if you do pursue that, how long roughly on a timeline does that take?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s probably something on a 18 months kind of line in terms of U.S. Air Force process, as you know we\u2019re already working here with the U.S. Air Force entitled to all this other stuff that\u2019s been going on. So that\u2019s probably something on that timeline. When I talk about other countries that don\u2019t need it, I mean obviously they do their own certification work and already talking about us how we work with them to do that. So those processes are probably a little quicker just because it\u2019s largely internal activity, but not something that would hold up sales or an order and that would be all incorporated as part of a program with the foreign customer.", "Peter Arment", "Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question that will come from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks good morning, thanks for taking the question. First one is on Cessna and aviation general excluding the latitudes are you \u2013 or excuse me, the longitudes coming into 2018, are you expecting jet deliveries overall to be up in 2018 or is the expectation that longitude is the net add, maybe subtracting a little bit of legacy?", "Scott Donnelly", "Myles, I can probably answer that question for you in about three months.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Well, I\u2019ve imagined you\u2019re working your production system, just wondering if there\u2019s any working capital management that\u2019s helping the cash flow this year as it relates to the aviation side or just more broad based?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, it\u2019s more broad based. Like I say, we\u2019re actually having to absorb the ramp on longitude, I mean obviously the aircraft that we expect to deliver in the certainly at least the first-half of next year and really probably now into the third quarter next year our aircrafts that are already in various stages of weapon. In some cases actually are all the way to finished goods, right. So that aircraft that we\u2019re flying around is a production unit. So there\u2019s definitely some pressure from our working capital to support the ramp of a longitude, but that\u2019s normal with any of our new products and we\u2019re just working to offset that working capital everywhere else in the business.", "Myles Walton", "Okay and the other one, Scott, maybe in industrial as a higher level question. But it\u2019s over half of the industrial business is fuel systems and the trend to electrification is obviously long, long-term but you have to start thinking and position this business for the next 10 years how do you look at that piece of industrial change it to a bit just position it for what may be a different world 10, 15 years from now?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, Myles, I think there\u2019s no question that the automotive industry and it\u2019s sort of a power plant is going to change over time. And I can tell you that a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing right now in Kautex with OEMs around the world, frankly there is already a significant shift going on in terms of how people think about hybrids, like I think the notion of a full electrification is something that\u2019s going to be a much longer timeframe in terms of any material portion of the industry. But there\u2019s no question that the hybrid technology is going to become a much, much higher proportion of the market here over the next 10 years.", "And we\u2019re working with a lot of those customers that actually does require some different technology in terms of how you support and build fuel systems that are hybrid, there\u2019s just a lot of \u2013 not to get into too much of the technicalities here, but the structural issues around the fuel system, the fuel tank where you don\u2019t have a constant draw of fluids and vapors out of that tank for a normal combustion engine. But can run for long periods of time on the electric side of a hybrid does drive some difference in the technology and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re already working and frankly already winning a number of programs that are our new products that they\u2019re going to have sort of these seven to 10 year horizons that we\u2019re working on right now and have already won on the program.", "So we are certainly sensitive to the changes that are going on there working with the customers to do that, but a full electrification at least I think when you do look at other guys, that\u2019s going to be a fairly small piece here over the next decade, but hybrid is a whole another issue, I think we\u2019re going to see a significant proliferation of hybrid technology.", "Myles Walton", "And is that a place where you\u2019re willing to put incremental capital in terms of acquisitions, despite the unknown about where the market goes in the next 20 years, or is this an organic you can adapt to the hybrid move?", "Scott Donnelly", "This is purely organic.", "Myles Walton", "Okay.", "Scott Donnelly", "Purely organic. Obviously, it\u2019s a different pooling. It\u2019s like a normal new platform, where you\u2019ve got to invest in new tooling and downstream and things like that, but this is purely organic. And to us, while it\u2019s a different technology is not different really from a business model or business process than what we do today.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott Donnelly", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Kristine Tan Liwag", "Hi, good morning, guys. It\u2019s Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hi, Kristine.", "Kristine Tan Liwag", "Scott, last month, GE announced that it\u2019s grounding its fleet of corporate jet. But your conversations with your corporate customers, do you think we\u2019ll see another wave of strategic change of how corporates look at their fleets? And if so, how much of the headwind do you think this could be in market recovery?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, I don\u2019t think that it is. I think when companies look at this thing from an economic standpoint. I think, they recognize the productivity in the value of using corporate there and the timing that saves. I mean, it\u2019s a huge productivity boost. I think if you talk to any of the customer trade groups, the NBAAs, people have them and use them, it\u2019s a huge productivity boom for the company. As to whether you use your own aircraft fleet or fractional or charter is driven by economics around how many hours a year you use those aircraft.", "So, looking our view the GE thing doesn\u2019t make any sense, unless you\u2019re going to stop flying corporate aircraft, when you fly that many hours, the economics is on your own aircraft is the right way to go. And I think that\u2019s the feedback we get from our corporate customers.", "Kristine Tan Liwag", "That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe following up on your comments on pricing in aviation and you discussed how you\u2019re using volume to manage some of the pricing expectations in the market. What\u2019s been your customer feedback and how do you approach customers that have been used to seeing discounts in the market to start getting them to believe that pricing is not coming down from here?", "Scott Donnelly", "So we\u2019ve been doing that by not lowering our prices. Frankly, look, I mean, customers are always going to look for the best deal, I think, everybody does. And as we have these conversations, there are always easy conversations. But we try to impress upon us, look, we\u2019re trying to run a business just like they are. And when you look at that relative price to market, it\u2019s \u2013 these aircraft are a great deal even at the current price levels compared to what they have historically been, and it\u2019s a great value. It\u2019s performance, it\u2019s economics that work for them.", "So I think customers are starting to believe it, because we\u2019re not getting the ends of quarters and giving lower discounts to move aircraft. We\u2019ll \u2013 as I say, we will take the trade on having a lower value \u2013 or I\u2019m sorry, having the lower volume on those aircrafst. And I think, certainly, we\u2019ve had customer test that. And we just say guys, look, it\u2019s a great deal and we want to do business with you, and \u2013 but we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not going to drop this pricing. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s not sustainable to be able to make the kind of investments that we need to make to support our customers and to have those next generations of products and not have reasonable margins on the products we\u2019re selling today.", "So, yes, tough discussion, but I think, these things are still an incredible value at these price levels. And, as you can see, we still \u2013 we get a lot of deal done. But there are some more guys are still going to continue to test. And that\u2019s fine, we just won\u2019t close those deals.", "Kristine Tan Liwag", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Drew Lipke", "Good morning guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Real quick on systems, the margins there managed to hold flat sequentially despite no Sensor Fuzed Weapon in sales and the unfavorable mix of TAPV, I\u2019m curious what drove the margin strength there and what\u2019s kind of the outlook for the rest of the year?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think the other parts of the system business, our unmanned business, our support and services businesses, our fee-for-service flight businesses continue to deliver solid performance and I mean that\u2019s really what\u2019s making the difference. As you know we had higher volume, our higher margin is driven around some of the SFW sales which are obviously not going to be here in the back half of the year, but I think we\u2019re trying to stabilize the TAPV program and again just to kind of get that thing behind us, but strong performance in other parts of the systems, namely in unmanned systems and support solutions and these areas that are helping to make up for the loss of having the SFW program here in the back half.", "Drew Lipke", "Great and then on Bell, just maybe directionally looking at backlog there, can you parse out the commercial backlog and the changes that you are seeing maybe on a year-over-year and sequential basis, again just directionally?", "Scott Donnelly", "No, we don\u2019t. You know as you guys know the dynamic of the Bell backlog goes through this cycle because we don\u2019t add the next multi year by \u2013 or the next year is multi-year component until we get into the process in the fourth quarter, so it\u2019s basically just doing its normal cycle that\u2019s all.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay, and then just last one, aviation aftermarket, can you talk about what steps if any you are taking to maybe capture more within the aftermarket and then as we think about the ADS-B mandate in that March theoretical backlog of work there, do you think that\u2019s going to be a meaningful driver to spur aftermarket demand going forward and how should we think about that impact?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think the AD is a bigger driver in terms of what we\u2019ll see in the aftermarket side of things. As you know we\u2019ve in general been open to taking back some of our aftermarket in terms of service centers and we\u2019ve played that out in a number of locations and that\u2019s gone well and we would always kind of look for opportunities to do that in the future as well, because I think that we have some good third-party service guys, but as we have opportunities to increase doing more and more of that direct, we will continue to look at those opportunities as we have done in the past, that strategy has worked out well.", "ADS-B is not a huge deal for us, I mean it\u2019s a huge deal to our customers and the cost, but really the lion\u2019s share of that is I mean we do a lot of those installations, we\u2019re doing those as we speak. So it does drive visits into the shop to do it, but a lot of those dollars obviously are the equipment which is being installed as opposed to the service labor which is really our content of doing that. So, it\u2019s not a \u2013 it is a significant cost to our customer, but it\u2019s not a big upside to us by any means.", "Drew Lipke", "Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.", "Eric Salander", "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call. Thank you for joining us and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you and ladies and gentlemen this conference will be available for replay after 10 AM Eastern Time today running through January 30, 2018 at mid night.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "Now, I will turn the conference over to your host, Eric Salander, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Eric Salander", "Thanks, Sean and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risk factors, which are detailed in our SEC filings and in today\u2019s press release. On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron\u2019s Chairman and CEO and Frank Connor, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings call presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Textron\u2019s revenues in the quarter were 4 billion, up 192 million from last year. During this year's fourth quarter, we had a couple of notable items that impacted our performance as we disclosed earlier this month in our 8-K filing. First, as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company recorded provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 266 million or $1 per share related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and the repatriation tax on our non-US undistributed earnings. ", "Second, we recorded 55 million in pretax restructuring charges or $0.14 per share after tax. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.74 per share, down $0.06 from last year's fourth quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was 474 million compared to 727 million last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the year, revenues were 14.2 billion, up 3% from a year ago. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $2.45 per share compared to $2.62 last year. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was 889 million, up from 573 million last year.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.", "Scott Donnelly", "Thanks, Eric and good morning, everybody. Revenues were up in the quarter with increases at industrial and Bell, partially offset by lower revenues at aviation and systems. At Bell, revenues were up on higher military volumes for the quarter. We delivered 7 V-22s, up from 4 last year; 13 H-1s, up from 8 last year and 45 commercial helicopters compared to 35 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. ", "On the commercial side, we continue to see a pickup in order demand across a broad base of customers. We've seen several recently signed 412 orders for customers in Southeast Asia. We received an order from Reignwood International for 50 505s as a follow on to the 60 aircraft that were ordered earlier this year. We also received an order from Mercy Flight for three 429s to upgrade the remainder of the existing air medical fleet. ", "On the new product front, we achieved first flight of our Bell V-280 Valor tiltrotor, representing a major milestone on this important development program. The systems revenues were down on lower volumes, primarily at Weapons and Sensors related to the discontinuance of the SFW production program. In the quarter, we received an FMS order for the Afghan National Army for 55 mobile strike force vehicles with a potential for up to 200 additional units. At TRU Simulation and Training, we signed an agreement with Copa airlines to provide a Boeing 737 MAX Full Flight SIM to fulfill the Latin American Airlines growing pilot training requirements.", "Moving to Industrial, revenues were up 20% for the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of Arctic Cat. We saw improved demand in the snow retail channel, allowing dealers to clear older inventory and drive 2018 model sales, including our new introductions in the youth and mountain categories. We also saw higher sales in our E-Z-GO product line, led by our new lithium powered ELiTE golf car. At Textron GSC, our ground transport business received an order from Airpro in Finland for seven [indiscernible] Typhoon de-icers. ", "Moving to Textron Aviation, revenues were 1.4 billion, down 3%. In the quarter, we delivered 58 jets, flat with last year, 31 King Airs, up from 28 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and two Beechcraft T-6 trainers, down from 8 last year. For the full year, we delivered 180 jets, up from last year\u2019s 178, including 54 Latitude deliveries. Since the introduction in 2015, we\u2019ve now delivered 112 Latitudes, demonstrating the importance of new product development in this industry. We saw strong order intake in the quarter for both turboprops and jets, including 8 caravans for charter cargo and logistics operators in Botswana, 3 King Air 250s to a North American customer configured for air ambulance services and three Latitudes for a fractional operator in Mexico.", "Moving to the aftermarket, increased aircraft utilization continue to drive higher aftermarket revenues, which were up over 11% in the quarter. ", "To summarize the year, we continued to execute our plan for growth through strategic acquisitions and new product innovation to create long term shareholder value. At Industrial, the integration of Arctic Cat continues and reflects our strategy of acquisitions that complement our core businesses and product lines. Equally important is the need to continue to innovate through new product introductions, which was evident throughout Textron\u2019s specialized vehicles. ", "Earlier this year, we unveiled the revolutionary E-Z-GO ELiTE lithium powered golf car, which has now seen over 21,000 units delivered. On the snow side, we introduced a class leading Arctic Cat ZR 200 new snowmobile as we continue to develop our [slate of] [ph] product line up. In December, we introduced the Textron offroad Havoc X, the best-in-class high performance side by side featuring 100 horsepower and a class leading four wheel double A-arm suspension package. At Textron systems, we advanced our ship to shore program towards first flight, introduced the night warden tactical unmanned aircraft system and received a follow-on FMS mobile strike force vehicle order. At Textron airborne solutions, we\u2019re making the necessary investments to position the business to capitalize on the growing era of the [indiscernible] services market.", "Moving to Bell, we saw the V-22 fleet surpass 400,000 flight hours, demonstrating the reliability of order technology, which we further evolved to another significant milestone, which was the first flight of the V-280. On the commercial side, strong order activity for the new 505 Jet Ranger X and the resumption of the 525 relentless flight test program demonstrates Bell\u2019s position as an innovative leader in the commercial helicopter market.", "At Textron Aviation, we saw improved order intake in the back half of the year as well as the strengthening of the international market. On the new product front, the Longitude is nearing the end of its flight test program and we anticipate certification in the first quarter. This new entry in the super mid-sized business aircraft market offers class leading range, payload and cruise speed along with a quietest interior in the industry. In November, we announced the Cessna SkyCourier, the new twin engine large utility turboprop. The FedEx is our launch customer with an initial fleet order of 50 aircraft.", "In summary, we came in to 2017 knowing it would be a challenging year with uncertainties surrounding many of our end markets, several key product development programs nearing key milestones and restructuring and integration activities in many of our businesses. That said, we have entered now on 505 into service, 525 is resuming its flight test program. We achieved first flight on the V-280. We had successful demonstration on both the Scorpion and the AT-6 in the US Air Force OA-X program. The Longitude is nearing its certification and entering to service. Denali is progressing towards first flight and we've successfully integrated the integration of Arctic Cat.", "With these accomplishments behind us in improving end markets, we're well positioned coming into 2018. As we look at our financial guidance, we're projecting revenues of about 14.6 billion as we expect growth at aviation and industrial, with lower revenues at Bell and Systems. We expect margin improvements across aviation, industrial and systems, with Bell about flat. EPS from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.95 to $3.15. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions will be in the range of 700 million to 800 million and consistent with 2017, we expect a substantial portion of the cash to be returned to shareholders through share repurchase programs again in 2018.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Frank.", "Frank Connor", "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. Segment profit in the quarter was 360 million, down 31 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 on 192 million increase in revenues. Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron Aviation. At Textron Aviation, revenues of 1.4 billion were down 3% from this period last year, primarily due to lower military volume. Segment profit was 120 million, down from 135 million a year ago, primarily due to higher research and development expense, largely driven by the Longitude flight test program. Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at 1.2 billion, up 15 million from the end of the third quarter.", "Moving to Bell, revenues were 983 million, up 11% on higher military volumes, partially offset by lower commercial volumes. Segment profit of 114 million was down 12 million despite the increase in revenues, primarily related to a change in commercial mix. Backlog in the segment was 4.6 billion at the end of the quarter, down 407 million from the end of the third quarter. At Textron systems, revenues were 489 million, down from 532 million a year ago on lower volume at weapons and sensors. Segment profit of 37 million was down 16 million, primarily reflecting the lower volume at weapons and sensors. Backlog in the segment was 1.4 billion, down 67 million from the end of the third quarter.", "Industrial revenues were 1.1 billion, up 20% largely related to Arctic Cat. Segment profit was up 10 million from the fourth quarter of last year due to favorable performance. Finance segment revenues decreased 3 million and profit increased 2 million.", "Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses were 44 million compared to 56 million last year. This reflected the transition of the Scorpion program into the aviation segment. Interest expense was 38 million, an increase of 5 million compared to last year. With respect to our restructuring plan, we recorded pre-tax charges of 55 million on the special charges line in the quarter. This represents the final charge under our restructuring programs. We ended the year with gross manufacturing debt of 3.1 billion. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 12 million shares at an overall cost of about $582 million.", "Turning out to 2018, our guidance includes the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This adoption principally impacts Bell and Textron Systems as we will transition government contracts from recognizing revenue at delivery to a cost incurred method. The impact of the new method will be immaterial to our overall segment profit with revenue slightly higher at Textron Systems and relatively unchanged at Bell. Also related to this adoption, we will record an increase to retained earnings of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2018 with no restatement of prior periods. Additionally, we are adopting a new pension accounting standard that will change how we present pension and OPEB costs on our income statement, but will not change our segment reporting. The effective adopting of this accounting standard will not have a material impact to our financial results. Finally to align with new revenue recognition standards, our R&D guidance is now presented on a gross basis whereas we previously netted US government shared R&D costs.", "Turning now to our presentation, I\u2019ll begin with our segments on slide 9. At Textron aviation, we're expecting higher revenues of about $5 billion, reflecting higher volumes across all our product lines. Segment margin is expected to be approximately 8%, reflecting the higher volume and improved performance. Looking to Bell, we're expecting overall revenues will be slightly down at about 3.2 billion, reflecting lower military volumes. We're forecasting a margin of about 12%. At systems, we're estimating lower 2018 revenues of about 1.6 billion, reflecting lower volumes in unmanned systems and weapons and sensors. Segment margin is expected to be 8%. At industrial, we're expecting growth in each of our businesses resulting in projected segment revenue of about 4.7 billion and a margin of about 8%. At finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about 20 million turning.", "Turning to slide 10, based on a US plan discount rate of 3.75%, we're estimating 2018 pension cost to be $40 million, down from last year.", "Turning to slide 11, gross R&D is expected to be about 620 million, down from 634 million in 2017. We're estimating CapEx will be about 525 million, up from last year. ", "Moving below the segment line and looking at slide 12, we're projecting about 130 million for corporate expense, 140 million for interest expense, a full year effective tax rate of about 22.5%. Our estimated tax rate for 2018 is lower than \u201917 due to the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. Our guidance assumes a share count of about 263 million shares, reflecting the continuation of our share repurchase activity in 2018.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. So Sean, we can open the line for questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "I guess first one on aviation margins, you\u2019re assuming up 150 basis points to 8% for aviation. How do we think about the R&D impact, mix and pricing factored into those assumptions?", "Scott Donnelly", "Sheila, I think it\u2019s largely favorable on all fronts. I mean, obviously as on the R&D front, as we finished last year's work around the Scorpion program, obviously we had a lot of work around the Longitude, we're complete with the Scorpion activity, the Longitude here will wrap up in the first quarter. Obviously, we have Denali coming along. We've got the SkyCourier, I mean, there's certainly plenty of work, but on a year-over-year basis, it's certainly a tailwind for them. ", "As we\u2019ve talked about, we will certainly have a better volume on our T-6 line, which has been a good business for us as we increase that. We certainly expect to see some margin improvement driven by that and we'll have a better year-over-year on the aftermarket side. We have seen a strong back half of the year, given the aircraft utilization rates are higher. So I think, particularly on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019ll benefit from that as we go into the first half.", "On the jet side, I don't think there will be a huge difference. We will have the initial Longitude deliveries, which is going to be most of the increase in the jet side of things. Obviously, the first few units will be at a lower margin rate, but that will correct as we get towards the back half of the year.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "And so in terms of pricing, there isn\u2019t a major pricing assumption there?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we do have price factored in. And as you will see, we had fairly strong year-over-year pricing increases here in the fourth quarter and we'll continue to do that. Part of what we're looking at in terms of volume anticipation in our plan is that, there's no question that we, I think, everyone feels much better about where we are in the end market here in terms of demand. So I think we're certainly -- compared to 2017 entering into a much better market. We are going to continue to drive price to make sure that it's healthy volume and I think that we will -- we were successful in doing that this year and I think we\u2019ll be successful doing it next year as well. So there will be obviously a positive contribution on the pricing side.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "And then as it regards to Scorpion R&D, I believe you might have ended up at 100 million for 2017, how do we think about that into 2018? Is there any way to quantify this?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was not that high, Sheila. We don\u2019t give R&D program by program, but certainly it's going to de minimis in 2018. There is still some customer activity going on, some demo flights, integration with a couple of different sensors that customers have asked us about, but it will be an immaterial number in 2018.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research.", "Carter Copeland", "Look, I wondered if you could give us just a little bit more color around the gross R&D disclosure. I think you don\u2019t disclose the R&D by program, but just kind of give us a sense of some of the moving pieces there year-over-year. Clearly, you've got Longitude and Scorpion are down and 525 is up, but now you've got that government portion that you called out in there, just any chance you can give us some color on the moving pieces there, just in general terms?", "Scott Donnelly", "I think when you look at our numbers, Carter, we\u2019ve recast last year so that this issue of what's netted versus gross is kind of a non-issue, we were showing you the numbers on an apples-to-apples basis. So the actual reduction that we're showing, again, your dynamics that you're kind of looking at are correct, right. We have significantly lower spend on Scorpion, we will see [indiscernible] some of the more intense spending around Longitude as we get that through certification. Principally that\u2019s offset by the fact that we have the 525 back in flight test and we have the V-280 in flight test. So that aircraft did get its first flight last year, but the guys are flying it a lot here in January and we expect to see that sustained all the way through the year. So it's largely a trade between a couple of those fixed wing programs and a couple -- some increased spending in the rotor and tiltrotor area.", "Carter Copeland", "And then an additional one for Frank on the pension front, any consideration around prefunding associated with the change in tax?", "Frank Connor", "Well, we did that last year. We did that in the third quarter. We did an offering kind of in the third quarter for $300 million and contributed that to the pension plan. So we feel like we're in very good shape. We did have a discount rate reduction, but frankly that was offset by our performance from a return standpoint in 2017 that was well above our expected rate and so we feel like we're in good shape on the pension front and do not anticipate any contributions as we said other than the 55 million of cash related to kind of unfunded plans.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.", "Robert Stallard", "Scott, your counterpart over at General Dynamics had some pretty positive things to say about the bizjet market in the fourth quarter. Would you agree with her general prognosis that we've seen a distinct turn in demand environment over the last three months?", "Scott Donnelly", "I would never disagree with Phebe. Look, I think what they're seeing in the larger aircraft is probably quite similar with what we're seeing in the light to mid-size where most of our work is. I think, the number of inquiries, the amount of activity through the fourth quarter, as you know, for us to sustain a one-to-one or greater book to bill in a fourth quarter, considering that's our seasonably very heavy sales side is a pretty significant accomplishment I think for our team to hold that book to bill. So, the amount of activity, the interest that I think is reflective of the fact that we have a stronger growth economy. ", "Business confidence is up and these are our buyers. So I think there's no question that the level of activity out there is stronger than we've seen in some time. Again, we're being a little bit cautious and making sure that we see all the stuff really convert and continue to convert into orders at a fair price and if that continues to happen, I think we feel the same about our business that it's in a very good position. We\u2019ve got some great new products. I think we're well positioned that if this market is in fact strengthening and it does deliver, that we\u2019ll be in good shape to benefit from that.", "Robert Stallard", "And then a follow-up on your investment plans, in terms of company funded R&D and CapEx going forward, where do you see this heading in 2019 and 2020?", "Scott Donnelly", "We\u2019re just kind of recovering from our 2018 activity. I don't know if I go into \u201919 and \u201920 just yet, but look, I think if you look at the work that we have underway, the amount of investment that we think we need to make to make sure that we have the right products in place in our key businesses to ensure that we can capitalize on strong markets, I don't think there's going to be a huge change in the R&D. Obviously, we expect it to continue to generate a tailwind in terms of percent of sales, but we have a lot of great stuff in the pipeline in aviation. We have a lot of great stuff in the pipeline at Bell. We have a lot of great stuff going on in the vehicle business and these are things where you need to make these investments, if you're going to continue to grow the business. So again, I don't think we'll see radical changes in terms of the R&D spend, but obviously our expectation is that it will reduce as a percent of sales.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.", "Peter Arment", "Scott, I guess finally to get pretty excited about the Longitude getting across the goal line here with certification. What's been some of the feedback now as you get close to kind of certification from some of the customers in terms of you've introduced before the aircraft too?", "Scott Donnelly", "It\u2019s been great, Peter. We have had a demo aircraft that's completely fitted out with full customer Interior that's been flying around, doing a lot of customer demos here for the last few months and I think the feedback has been great. It's a great cabin, I mean from a space standpoint, we get a lot of the same feedback that we got in the Latitude, which has been obviously a very, very well received product. ", "Obviously, this is a bigger aircraft. It's a longer aircraft, it's a very quiet aircraft. It is the quietest aircraft in the industry and we get that feedback very strong, customers getting back of this thing and do a demo flight and are amazed at how quiet and as a result comfortable it is in the back of that aircraft. So again, the feedback is great. We need to get this thing across the goal line on the certification and we feel good about where the aircraft is. It's flown beautifully. I mean, it\u2019s -- there's no issues there. It\u2019s a matter of getting through the paperwork and certification process, which we will do.", "Peter Arment", "And then just a quick one, maybe Frank or just on the CapEx step up, what's really driving that this year.", "Scott Donnelly ", "Well, the big step up is, as we've kind of been public with Peter is we're acquiring quite a few assets to be able to support these adversary air programs and so that's really the change in year-over-year is our acquisition of aircraft. The Navy program is in proposal phase right now. The Air Force is already having their industry days. So, there is a huge opportunity out there in terms of the number of hours that the US government and I believe, ultimately international customers as well are going to look to private contractors to provide adversary air and the reality is, if you don\u2019t have the assets, you can\u2019t do it. So, the only tough part of this for us is you got to get out in front of it and spend the capital to have the assets and get everything prepared in terms of maintenance facilities and demos, so there's a little bit of a drag frankly in there to support that, but it's a huge growth opportunity and one that seems to be materializing.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Cai Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai Rumohr", "So last year, you projected R&D and this is on a net basis for 2017 of 495 and the gross number was 634, so what was the number apples to apples, \u201917 versus -- achieved versus \u201917 projected.", "Scott Donnelly", "Hold on a second. We\u2019re on apple-to-apple and so that we can get to your other apple-to-apple out.", "Cai Rumohr", "If you tell me what the military is, I think we can back into it. Hello.", "Scott Donnelly", "We're just trying to go back to the guidance number.", "Cai Rumohr", "It was 495 net.", "Scott Donnelly", "It was about 520.", "Cai Rumohr", "So basically you overran your guide by 25 million and I assume a lot of that was with Scorpion and to a lesser extent the Longitude?", "Scott Donnelly", "It was primarily driven by the support we put into the Air Force experimental program. So between mission system development on Scorpion as well as the cost to get the AT-6 up and running and configured and ready for that test, that's most of what drove the spend. So when we started the year, we didn't know anything about the Air Force experimentation program and obviously putting two aircraft in to that program was not in our plan.", "Cai Rumohr", "All right. And maybe you said that the outlook is good to sell them. Who's going to buy it and when?", "Scott Donnelly", "Are you talking about Scorpion?", "Cai Rumohr", "Yeah. Scorpion or AT-6, either ones.", "Scott Donnelly", "So, look, I think that the Air Force has been very open about the fact that they're working on determining their next steps. We have a reason to believe that they're doing that in terms of what their next step is going to be. The CR complicates that process for them, because obviously these are new programs and therefore they don't really have any budget authority under CR to do that, but we know they're working to determine what those next steps will be. I think the next steps again will be different for different platforms, but it would be presumptuous to talk much about that since they haven't been able to publicly say what they want to go do until they understand their budget situation.", "In terms of non-US not related things, as I said, we still have customers that are in discussions with us. There are ongoing activities. I think the level of activity in terms of what we have to spend to support those at this point is pretty de minimis, but we have customers coming in, asking questions, looking at integration of different systems and we continue to support that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.", "Pete Skibitski", "Scott, I was wondering if you can talk more about what you're hearing in terms of the impact of tax reform to your light bizjet customer base. They've got the corporate rate reduction, which I imagine, if you're a small business owner, that's got to be helpful. You've got, I think the media expensing up to 2022, but you've also got just kind of issue the repeal, light kind exchanges. So just wondering how you're hearing that\u2019s all going to net out for your bizjet customer base?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, I think it nets out all to the positive really. Right. So, there's certainly a benefit to them, sort of what I would say mechanically around tax. That is the 100% expensing is beneficial. The overall tax rate reduction for all these businesses is obviously very helpful. And I think probably even more importantly, I think everybody's expectation is that and I think we're seeing this is that the impact of the tax cuts beyond the mechanics here is to help drive economic growth and get GDP at a higher level and I think we're seeing that and that reflects when a guy is sitting there, looking at his business and what their anticipation, what their expectations are for the growth of their own business, I think this is what's driving business confidence to a very high level. ", "So I think the combination of the direct tax benefit around expensing, the low rate that they\u2019re experiencing in their business and probably most importantly, the level of confidence they have that they're going to see growth in their business as a result of higher economic growth, higher GDP primarily around the US is all very positive. So I think that is a huge help in terms of the US market and I think we're also seeing stimulation around the international markets. And again the US helps to drive that. ", "If we have higher economic growth, that's good for generally speaking economies around the world, a little bit of weakening on the dollar obviously for a company like ourselves, the US manufacturer with a lot of export is beneficial. So I think that not only the direct impact around tax in the US, but the knock on benefits in some of the international markets is clearly we're seeing a different tone in those markets as well. So sort of a combination of all of the above.", "Pete Skibitski", "One quick headwind, at systems in 2018, could you guys quantify the year-over-year headwind from the Sensor Fuzed weapon closure and then, so UAVs will be down in \u201818. Are they going to bounce back, return to growth or will that be kind of a flattish outlook going forward for UAVs?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, certainly, it\u2019s going to be down this year, Peter. The question is going to be, there are a couple of new upgrade programs and things that are in the works, but again if this is one of our challenges in again that business, which has a large US centric customer base is where do the budgets go, when do we get budgets, I mean, there's a lot of noise around that. There's certainly opportunities around that class of aircraft to look at next generations of upgrades and enhancements and improvements, which we would benefit if that goes forward, but without having budgets, it's hard to figure out exactly where that is. ", "So it's in terms of the future, it\u2019s hard for me to comment directly on that. I can't give you the direct number, I don't think of SFW, but last year, we went basically, if you think about what our SFW was, we had about 50% of what we usually have last year and we have a 0% this year. So we\u2019re sort of taking a two-step from what that business historically was to basically being out of that business right now. Now, there are a number of new weapons, munitions programs that we're bidding on, that we're actively pursuing. Again, the budget situation makes it difficult to know exactly where these are going, but that's certainly a business where we've gone through a steep decline as a result of the exit of SFW, but obviously we have a lot of work going on to try to get that piece of the business back in a growth trajectory.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Can you just tell us what your underlying assumptions are in terms of aviation delivery this year? We know the Longitude is coming in, but just kind of jets versus King Airs T-6s broadly, how are you thinking about it year-over-year?", "Scott Donnelly", "I'd say probably, Sam, the jets, we're assuming at this point largely flattish with the exception of an increase driven by the Longitude introduction. The Turboprops, clearly, we expect those to be up, T-6 and we talked about all year, this was a tough year for us in \u201917 on T-6s, we see a nice increase in T-6 deliveries in 2018. We saw a fairly weak front half of the year on the commercial turboprops. Obviously, we're feeling better about where we're going in to 2018 in terms of the level of activity and frankly some backlog in those areas. ", "So I certainly think that we'll see increases in the commercial turboprop in total as well and again, we saw strong growth in the second half of the year in the service side of the business, driven by high utilization rates. So clearly, we would expect that we'll see that continue, which means we will see particularly comparables in the first and second quarter of the year will be stronger than they were in \u201917. You get to the back half of the year, I mean it's hard to say at this point, but it's -- because we saw a lot of growth year-over-year already in those two quarters. But as far as I say Sam, I think that if you look at jets principally driven in our assumptions around Longitude, service growth and clearly in material, we\u2019ll probably see growth, especially on the military side of the business.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And is there any way to think about in terms of new programs, whether it's 525 or Longitude, how many you can expect to get out this year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, so we don't go -- we don't do units by model. Obviously, we expect to get a certification by the end of the quarter, so you would expect to enter into service with first customer deliveries in the second quarter and look, again, it depends a lot on how the market is doing and I\u2019d say, the feedback on the aircraft is very strong. As we\u2019ve seen in recent times as you won't start to see lot of these things closed orders until you worked your way through the certification. So we kind of have to play that by year. So 525, you won't have sales this year, right. We should get all of our flight test program complete and wrapped up by the end of the year. Everything should be in to the FAA and we\u2019ll be working at the certification process at the end of \u201918. But we certainly don't expect to see sales, the first 525 sales activity should be \u201919.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And then just more on Bell, I guess 12% margins on modestly lower sales, last year, you started at 11 in terms of the margin ended up doing better. It feels like what has changed in the helicopter business that\u2019s allowing you to put up these kind of margins versus the 10% or 11% and what are those key drivers in terms of what\u2019s down year-over-year on a sales level?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, what's down on a year-over-year sales level will be on the military side, right. We'll see fewer military sales. I think that we certainly hope to turn that corner. There's a lot of FMS activity that\u2019s going on. Obviously, we've been frustrated by lack of notifications in Congress, some things in the Middle East, but clearly we have customers that want product and we think we'll get some of that progressed into the order category here as we work our way through \u201918 to try to get that turnaround. We certainly expect to be up on the commercial side. We have a good full year of strong deliveries on 505s. ", "We've closed couple of important orders on 412s. So we\u2019ll certainly see an increase in 412 volumes this year, which is a great product for us obviously. So, in general, you're seeing a trade between some military product that's going to be the lower volume and commercial that\u2019s going to be at a higher volume, but net of all that, I think the team is doing a nice job of managing, driving good activity to help offset some significant investments in the new product front, but it's a pain for all for us. The 505 is driving good volume, the 412 VPI, those upgrade programs are helping to give the 412 alive and well and obviously we have the 525 and the B280 coming down the line. So, I think the business is doing a nice job of driving productivity, maintaining strong margins and yet making some pretty significant investments in products that are going to drive our future growth.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company.", "Justin Bergner", "I just want to discuss the demand for business jets and tax reform. First off, as it relates to personal purchases of business jets, are you, as a team, aware of anything that would prevent someone from buying a business jet and taking the full deduction on their personal tax return to get a deduction where the state and local tax deduction might be going away for a wealthy individual.", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I mean, it has to be a business expense, right. So I mean we certainly have individuals that purchase aircraft and they have to pro rata the depreciation between business and personal utilization. But no, absolutely, there is nothing in the tax law that changes with respect to how that's done. The only difference is that it\u2019s 100% expensing versus the 50%. Well, I mean, obviously, we have bonus depreciation, which is 50% year one. But no, there's no change in the tax law. It's purely a matter of allocation between a legitimate business expense or a personnel expense.", "Justin Bergner", "And then, there was a big article in The Sunday Times by a London based business jet broker talking about sort of extraordinary ramp up in demand for business jets. Over recent months, are you seeing any signs of sort of meaningful acceleration. I know you have a tempered guidance for business jets, but are there signs that you're seeing that suggest maybe things are going to ramp up much quicker than your guidance would suggest?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I have to say I don't usually read the Sunday Times, so I don't know this, but this is a article, but look, we are -- I think the sentiment that we're seeing in customer interaction, the level of activity is all very positive, we need to see these things come to fruition. There's no question that in the used aircraft market, that's continued to be a good liquidity. People are selling aircraft. Good news for us is we see fewer trades because the market is strong enough, the brokers out there are being able to move aircraft. So what I hope is right and obviously we think with the investments that we've made and the product lineup we have that if the market strengthens, we\u2019ll be a big beneficiary of that, but I think we need to see sort of that, the enthusiasm that we sense that's out there turning to sales.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi.", "Jon Raviv", "When you look at slide 9 of your presentation, where do you see some of the opportunities or risks, not just in \u201918 but really going forward and maybe speaking more about something like systems where in the past, we've seen double digit margin, industrial margin used to be higher and obviously aviation could be higher as well. On a long run basis, where do you want to see improvement in your segment?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we'd like to see improvement everywhere. I mean I kind of still think that we work with the guys all through the year, but look aviation, when we look at the aviation number, obviously, we are assuming a relatively flattish legacy jet line. And clearly, we have the ability to flex that, if we do see stronger demand. So if we see stronger demand, if market is there, then we can see upside to that. I think at Bell, you're probably not able to see a whole lot of upside on the revenue side and we pretty much know what that number is. The guys do a good job generally as we work our way through the year on the productivity side, but I think it's a pretty solid guide. ", "Obviously, we\u2019ll try to work to get a little upside on the profitability side, but it's, I think, even at 12%, the business is doing really well and it's pretty balanced performance. Look, systems is tough, because if you take SFW out, which is a great program for us, we're kind of heavy right now on things like ship to shore, which are great programs, I mean there's going to be a lot of volume there and a great business going forward, but we're still in that sort of fixed price development and we\u2019re working in the integration and testing to come along okay. We should get some major milestones this year as we get the thing into the water and get it operating and go through trials. ", "But, I wouldn't say that there's a lot of upside there, just given the nature of the kind of programs that we're executing right now. Industrials, probably, I mean a pretty solid guide I think. I mean there's, it gets Arctic Cat to where it\u2019s accretive, it's pretty solid performance, but I think that's where we would really expect to be. So that\u2019s kind of color around that I guess. Clearly, the largest upside would be if the business aviation market really does start to accelerate and we\u2019ll benefit from that.", "Jon Raviv", "And just in your commentary about the tax reform bill, creating changes in the economy, what do you guys doing maybe almost philosophically, how are you guys approaching the way you're managing the business, capital allocation with this relatively wide ranging bill now legislated?", "Frank Connor", "It really hasn't changed our strategy. I mean, we've already been investing significantly in terms of R&D and our next generations of products. I think, we've been appropriately putting the capital in place to support that, be it in the tooling to support new product programs, continue to win and grow in our industrial businesses. So, I think our capital allocation strategy isn't really impacted. I mean, clearly, we will see a cash tax benefit in \u201918 as a result of the lower tax rates. And as I said, I think from a capital allocation perspective, we'll continue to pursue what we did in \u201917, which was frankly pretty aggressive on the buyback side and that's been our principal way of returning cash for our shareholders and I would expect to see that continue in \u201918.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.", "Seth Seifman", "Scott, in recent years, you guys have had some tough breaks in some of the end markets and some execution items that came up and so there's been a fair number \u2013 a fair amount of downward pressure on estimates. When you think about how you set up this year and how things are looking, I mean I know you always set the guidance and intend to make it, but in terms of like the puts and takes and how much risk there is around the guide this year compared to previous years, how would you sort of -- how would you assess that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, so I think it\u2019s kind of the walk that we just did through the page 9 is kind of where I would say the puts and takes are to this thing. I mean, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve struggled a little bit, particularly in the third quarter in some of the industrial, on TSV. I think the guys are getting that back on track. I mean, there's obviously still work to do in finishing the integration, but we're -- I think our guidance is a fair number. There is -- I don't know that I could add a whole lot more color to it. I mean I think, yeah, we ran into some softer end markets than we expected. ", "We had a couple of problem programs that put a lot of pressure on us in \u201917, which we started the year at \u201917 saying that we probably were dealing with a difficult year in terms of a lack of growth, which we've historically delivered. But I think we're positioned well going into \u201918. There's all these issues to work through the year, but I think a lot of the things that we need to do, both problem programs as well as some investments that we thought we needed to do and things we had to get in place for \u201918 are largely there. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are going into the year.", "Seth Seifman", "And just as a follow-up on V-22, maybe if you could give us an update on where you think we are in terms of signing the next multi-year in terms of you, if the type of appropriations bill that\u2019s being talked about gets signed, if that gives you, you think, a plus up and maybe kind of take some of the sting out of the decline that\u2019s coming for 2019 and 2020 and how you're thinking about preparing Bell for that, just sort of an overall update on V-22?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, so V-22 is the multi-year three, negotiations are underway, right. We're working that in real time with the customer. I think they obviously are working and I'm trying to understand their budgets and that whole process to frame the program, but right now, I would say, we're probably looking at a Q2 or so contract to get multi-year 3 underway. I think the program record is well understood. Obviously, we\u2019ve had the ads on the Navy program that are again well understood and I don't think there's going to be a whole lot of volatility around the volumes, but it will be a step down certainly from where it was in multi-year 2. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed. I think it is probably looking like a five year program, all right. There was a while there, people were talking maybe it could be a seven year program. It's looking to me, I think the way they're going to appropriate, it will probably be in a more of a five year contract, which is fine.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Scott, I was wondering if you could break out at least a little bit overall, the back like increase or the book to bill that would have been in commercial versus military because it seems like military was down and commercial would have been up by more.", "Scott Donnelly", "George, I think from a color standpoint, the stuff that was in -- largely in the backlog, predominantly on the T-6 front has been there. So most of the movement you've seen was driven by the commercial side of the business.", "George Shapiro", "So if you took out the military side, what would be the commercial have been up?", "Scott Donnelly", "I don't think we'll probably do any more color than that, George in terms of the backlog.", "George Shapiro", "And then on R&D, why wouldn\u2019t R&D be down by more in \u201918? I mean, I figure Scorpion was maybe 75 million in \u201917, going down to pretty close to zero and you've got total backlog down, total R&D down 14 million. Longitude finishes, you start delivery here in the first quarter. So where's all the imputed higher R&D coming from?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, we are obviously getting a benefit significantly lower funding as you say on the Scorpion program. We do have the Longitude, which will be still strong here in the -- at least in the first quarter or so of the year as we finish the certification testing. So we will certainly have less R&D spending on the fixed wing side, but we do have the knowledge heading towards its first flight. We do have the SkyCourier program, which is I think will be a great program for us and we're being pretty aggressive about getting all over that thing and doing that program in sort of that 30-month window and have a whole team work in that. ", "So it's not like R&D spending is going away in the fixed wing world. We do have work to do and I think programs that will be very strong growth programs for us. As I said, I think there is a bit of a shift here with 525 being back with the whole year of the flight test program, V-280, which again is a huge potential program for us. So a lot of R&D spending in that area to support that flight test program as well.", "George Shapiro", "And then last one, how long would it take for you to decide that you want to increase production rates if you saw continued strengthen in the business jet market, would that be something you could do in six months or would that be something that would more affect \u201919?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we're in a position that we could affect \u201918 and more in a six month kind of a window.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Ronald Epstein from Bank of America.", "Ronald Epstein", "Can you give us an update on hemisphere in light of the engine issues, with the 5X program being killed at SO and then moving on to a different engine, where is that hemisphere and are you guys thinking about a different engine, just if you can give us an update on that.", "Scott Donnelly", "So, our guys are actively engaged or sort of real time I guess I would say Ron on that -- the issue of where is the engine and what will the scope and timeframe be to get the engine on track. So in the case of that particular aircraft, I mean I think what you saw, the 5X carriers do is go to a larger aircraft. You have to match engine airplanes obviously pretty well to make it work. That's obviously not a strategy that we would follow. So, in our case, to do that aircraft requires that engine. I mean to get the differentiation in the market, to fuel burn efficiency range and whatnot is dependent on that aircraft or on that engine, I'm sorry and the engine performing prospects. ", "So we are working with the guys to understand where they are and what their path forward is. And look, we\u2019ll have to sort of gate off of that, Ron. So right now, we're in a position where we haven't spent a ton of money on that program. We continue to do a lot of the early work that you need to do around key subsystems, selections and basic air dynamic work and whatnot. That\u2019s at a fairly low level and we'll have to make a call, when do we lean into that program or not based on what we see as the engine timeline.", "Ronald Epstein", "Is there an opportunity there to maybe use Canada engine or something like that or is that kind of not a possibility?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think the challenge to do, to make that aircraft be what we want it to be, that\u2019s the engine that makes it work. So if you go to a larger engine, then you've got to go to a larger aircraft and that's a path that we're not going to do. Ultimately, again, it all depends on where this engine is. If the engine is not there, then you're kind of would do a step back and say, okay guys, what do we want to do. Going bigger doesn't make sense to us, so we would have to evaluate a change in our strategy, but again, it\u2019s all predicated on where the engine is and we just don't know yet.", "Ronald Epstein", "And then maybe just a follow-on from that, if something didn't go well with Safran, is there any recourse for you guys or is it still too early to even project that?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, no, not really, Ron. But again, we haven't put an enormous amount of money to that anyway at this stage of the game. So, there's obviously, I mean, you could, like I said, you could step back, you could suspend the program, you could -- there's a whole bunch of options here, but there's no significant financial harm that's been caused. So I mean, it's not like we would go back with any kind of recourse. You just have to wait and see how the engine program progresses.", "Ronald Epstein", "And then if I can, maybe just one more really big picture question. There's been a lot of talk in the general aviation community about like the electrification of aircraft, particularly around propulsion. Is Cessna looking at that at all? Do you have any thoughts on if that\u2019s kind of to Buck Rogers and far out there, is that something that could be more of a reality sooner?", "Scott Donnelly", "Look, we have spent some time and our kind of advanced concepts guys running numbers and looking at that, it's tough math, right. I mean when you look at how much energy is required to take an aircraft and go any kind of range with any kind of a weight, the energy storage technology just isn't there, right. I mean when you talk about anything in the air, weight is not your friend. So, we continue to look at that. By the way, we are doing the same thing on the rotorcraft side, right. I mean, we've probably done more work on the rotorcraft side because there are some small drone technologies and smaller vehicles that don't have to go this far and just the nature of a helicopter, you tend to do shorter ranges and less weight, so it's probably more feasible in the rotorcraft world. ", "We\u2019re doing short hop kind of things as opposed to the longer haul that you see in the fixed wing aviation side. But it's largely going to be driven by energy storage and electric propulsion, which for us is -- that's our supply base that does that. So are we actively engaged with guys that are working on that? Absolutely. Do I see it as becoming a material thing that is going to happen in the sort of mid timeframe? Probably not.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "Just a question for you on the M&A landscape and how you\u2019re approaching it this year, whether it\u2019s a buyer or seller of assets?", "Scott Donnelly", "We don't make any comments with respect to M&A on either front, Rajeev.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "And then as it relates to Bell, Scott, you were talking about not seeing too much in terms of margin opportunity, can you maybe highlight how an oil and gas opportunity would fit into that, just with oil and gas prices obviously a bit better here?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I don't think it has anything to do with the margin side of things, Rajeev. Yeah. I mean, we\u2019re expecting the business around 12%. If you think about oil and gas, which I agree, I mean there is some -- certainly some strengthening in that -- in that end market, I think in terms of sales into the oil and gas industry, we are actually seeing some of that already, I mean, in some of the more near end, so therefore some the smaller helicopters, there is clearly opportunity in the longer haul here in terms of things like 525. But there is also a lot a assets out there, right. I mean as they went through a pretty tough contraction, they\u2019ve got a lot of assets back to work, but clearly we see that end market as a big opportunity for the 525 and hopefully here as we see that end market start to strengthen and we get the 525 through certification, we\u2019ll be about lined up in the right place, but it certainly won't be a 2018 impact.", "Rajeev Lalwani", "And a quicker clarification on Arctic Cat, could you say that is going to hit the target of being accretive this year.", "Scott Donnelly", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Drew Lipke from Stephens.", "Drew Lipke", "On aviation and commercial turboprop, King Air deliveries still kind of a low level here in the second half, caravan deliveries were down pretty significantly year-over-year. You talked about inquiries picking up a little bit last quarter. Did you see that convert into increased orders and then maybe just a little commentary on that market for 2018?", "Scott Donnelly", "We did. I think the senior market started in the earlier part of last year, a little soft. It certainly strengthened as the year went on. I think we'll be in a pretty solid position here as we go through \u201818. Caravan similarly, we're quite soft in the first half of the year, got stronger as the year went on. I think we've seen a pretty strong level of order activity on caravan. So we feel very good about those going into 2018.", "Drew Lipke", "And then on Bell commercial, how much of the order book build or the strength that you've seen there has been tied to the China market and how much of that is due to just some of the regulatory changes that we've seen in that market and how is your opportunity there and how sustainable is it in your opinion?", "Scott Donnelly", "Well, I think we haven't seen a lot of change on the regulatory side in the low altitude spaces. I mean that has been certainly more noise than other areas. We continue to feel very good about China in terms of how we're doing and particularly on the light side. So this past year obviously, we have large orders for 407s, large orders for 505s. So I think we feel very good about our position in the Chinese market, particularly as it has to do with the light, so particularly the 505 and the 407. And I think our deliveries into China this year as we look at our backlog and our customer base is, I think will be pretty strong.", "Eric Salander", "Okay.
