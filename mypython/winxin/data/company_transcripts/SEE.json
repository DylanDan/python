At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website, at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled, Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.", "We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings press release. Included in today's presentation on slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016, and this was net of $276 million in CapEx and $66 million in restructuring. The significant upside relative to our guidance was primarily driven by our continuous strong focus on working capital. We also delivered $0.76 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016 after repurchasing only 5 million shares in the first nine months of the year.", "In the fourth quarter, both Food Care and Diversey Care delivered organic sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. In Food Care, protein packaging volumes in North America increased more than 6%. Our hygiene business increased by 5% in constant dollars and we delivered favorable price mix on a global basis. Diversey Care's growth was primarily driven by favorable price mix of over 2% and volume increases of 7% and 3% in Asia-Pacific and North America, respectively. Where we felt short in the quarter was our top-line constant dollar growth in Product Care, which weighed on our adjusted EBITDA performance.", "We knew December would be a critical month for us with most of our global growth depending on our e-Commerce business, and we were happy with our e-Commerce volume growth of 15% in the quarter, but this was offset by weakness in global industrial GDP and our product rationalization efforts. And despite the shortfall in sales, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.", "So as I'm sure you all know, I am not happy with our overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016. We underestimated the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market and the weakness in the industrial world. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with the agility of our organization, its ability to deliver bottom line results and properly prioritize. I'm also extremely pleased with the innovation pipelines and the number of new disruptive products that we are gradually introducing and launching across the three divisions.", "Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth for Food Care and Product Care, and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-Commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017 and our plans to rebuild our consumer brands business is very well underway.", "We recognize that 2017 will prove to be a critical year for Sealed Air, particularly, as we proceed with our plans for the separation of New Diversey. As you know, we disclosed back in October that we are pursuing a tax-free spin-off. And today, we announced that we are also exploring all the strategic alternatives including the potential sale of New Diversey, and we're confident that the separation is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation, and will enable us to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. At this point, we are very limited on what we can share about the separation process, and thank you in advance for respecting our need to significantly limit our comments.", "So now let me turn back on the full quarter and year-end performance. On slide 5 and 6 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter and the full year. In Q4, organic sales growth was 2% with positive trends across all regions. Organic growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. And in EMEA, positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care were partially offset by declines in Product Care. And performance in Asia was very strong in Diversey Care at 7% constant dollar growth, but the total company's results were impacted by a 10% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia accounted for approximately 7% of Food Care net sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, net sales increased 1.3% as compared to 2015 on an organic basis. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9% and organic growth in EMEA was 2%. North America and Asia Pacific were essentially unchanged as compared to last year.", "Turning to slide 7, which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. You can see that from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were flat to up 2% throughout the year. Let me highlight that our volume in North America has accelerated throughout the year, with 4.2% growth in the fourth quarter on the heel of 3.8% in the third quarter. We delivered favorable price mix in each quarter throughout 2016 as a result of positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care.", "Now, let me to turn to slight 8 and review Food Care results. Positive volume trends in North America and EMEA, favorable price mix, and disciplined cost management were key contributors to our fourth quarter organic sales growth of 3%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year. We're seeing the benefit of higher beef volume and market share gains through the continued global adoption of our new products. Similar to the third quarter, these positive trends were offset by volume declines in Australia and Latin America.", "For the full year 2016, Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales or 2% organic sales growth. Packaging solutions were $2.6 billion, and hygiene solutions were $600 million. In adjusted EBITDA, Food Care reported $661 million or 20.5% of net sales. Packaging solutions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $593 million or 22.7% of net sales and hygiene delivered the remaining $68 million of EBITDA or 11.3% of net sales. I'd like to highlight that the hygiene business has improved its margins by over 400 basis points on an as-reported basis since 2013 and has a very bright future as part of New Diversey by providing market-leading solutions and technology advancements enhanced by acquisitions of Dry Lube and Ciptec.", "For the full 2017, Food Care sales are forecasted to increase approximately 3% in constant dollars. Our core business is expected to continue growing faster than the market with more contribution from our Change the Game initiatives, particularly OptiDure and Darfresh. Latin America is starting to stabilize and Australia will continue to be impacted by declines in the beef market, also to a lesser degree as compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales and similar to 2016, we expect the Q1 to be our low point for sales and EBITDA.", "Turning to Diversey Care's results on slide 9, you can see that net sales were up 3% in constant dollars in the fourth quarter and up 2% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13% increased 180 basis points in the quarter and for the full year, margins increased 120 basis points to 12.8%. Sales growth in the quarter and throughout the year was driven by increased sales from existing and new customers in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant sales growth. And in Asia-Pacific, growth was led by strength in China, India and Southeast Asia. Towards the Middle East and parts of Europe, the hospitality sectors struggled in the second half, as a result of declines in tourism and occupancy rates, due to terrorist attacks.", "In 2017, Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results. And as I noted earlier, our plans are well underway to mitigate the impact of SCJ; and sales from the core business, excluding SCJ, is growing on an accelerated pace. This growth is a direct result of the investments that we have made in our product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and sales organization.", "Slide 10 highlights the results from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter and full year, Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged as compared with 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% in 2016.", "In the fourth quarter, Product Care delivered strong volume trends in North America, which were partially offset by declines in Europe. Adjusting for product rationalization, North America volumes were up approximately 5%, driven by strength in our e-Commerce segment. And similar to the third quarter, our performance in Europe was negatively impacted by the industrial environment. And in the latter half of 2016, we have been introducing an unprecedented number of new technologies and solutions, and as a result, we are experiencing significant interest from our customers, which mainly you saw firsthand at Pack Expo \u2013 many of you saw at Pack Expo in early November. Sales for these products including I-Pack, FloWrap, StealthWrap, Inflatable, Bubble and also mailers are expected to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both our top and bottom line growth.", "We will continue to invest heavily in the business to support new product launches and global growth opportunities. But for our industrial based business, we are planning for sales to be relatively in line with 2016. And also keep in mind that our rationalization efforts are behind us, so that you will not see a true apples-to-apples constant dollar sales growth rate until the second half of 2017. For the full year 2017, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 3%, and similar to Food Care, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales.", "And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and more details on our outlook for 2017. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and $15 million to top line growth in the quarter and for the full year, respectively. Favorable price mix was $9 million in Q4 and $41 million for the year. Unfavorable currency translation was $40 million in the quarter and $243 million in 2016. Food Care divestitures impacted sales by $5 million in Q4 and $102 million for the full year.", "On slide 12, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion or 17.1% for the full year. Mix and price/cost spread was $13 million favorable in Q4 and $46 million in 2016. Volume growth contributed $9 million to the quarter, and $19 million for the year. Restructuring savings were $10 million and $43 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses increased $6 million in the quarter. For the full year, operating expenses increased $69 million, most of which is related to compensation inflation. Currency was a negative $4 million in Q4 and a negative $35 million in 2016. For the full year, divestitures had a negative impact of $21 million on adjusted EBITDA.", "Adjusted gross margins improved 60 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the full year, resulting in 36.8% margin and 37.4% margin, respectively. We were pleased with this performance in light of the volatility of input cost and timing of raw material cost pass through in Food Care. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.66 for the full year. Currency translation reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and by $0.11 for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18% and for the full year 21.6%. We repurchased 4.7 million shares for approximately $217 million in 2016. We still have approximately $667 million available under the board approved share repurchase plan, and expect to return to share buybacks, following the New Diversey separation.", "Turning to slide 13, free cash flow was a source of cash of $631 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of cash of $151 million. CapEx increased to $276 million, which includes $100 million related to the investment in our Charlotte campus and $30 million related to other CapEx restructuring activity. CapEx in 2015 was $184 million. As Jerome commented, the strong free cash flow performance was driven by optimization of our working capital, including the implementation of our new supply chain financing program, our procurement team and our credit and collections team exceeded their targets for the fourth quarter, generating more than $80 million improvement above our prior guidance for free cash flow.", "Now, turning to outlook on slide 14, in constant dollars, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.5% for the full year 2017. This forecast assumes approximately 1% constant dollar growth for Diversey Care and approximately 3% growth for both Food Care and Product Care. While both volume and price mix are expected to be contributors to 2017 growth, we expect more growth to come from accelerated volume trends throughout the year. We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $220 million or 3%. Our major currency exposures in 2016 included: the euro, which was approximately 18% of net sales; the British pound, which was 5%; Australian dollar was 4%; and the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar were each approximately 3% of net sales.", "2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $1.18 billion. Please note that contrary to last year, interest income of $10 million is excluded from our EBITDA guidance. Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $40 million. As a reminder, a 5% swing in the euro has an impact of approximately $10 million on adjusted EBITDA. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2017. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $215 million.", "Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.70, assuming unfavorable currency translation of $0.14. We expect our adjusted tax rate to increase to approximately 23%, which will negatively impact year-over-year EPS by $0.05. Our forecast for EPS is based on a weighted average 197 million diluted shares. We are forecasting free cash flow to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash, as we continue to progress on inventory management and our supply chain financing program.", "Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $85 million to $100 million, depending on the pace of addressing stranded costs. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million in 2017, with additional savings in 2018. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million. Cash tax payments are estimated to increase to a $175 million. And CapEx is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately a $185 million. Our outlook for free cash flow in 2017 does not include any material fees associated with the separation efforts of New Diversey. The cost associated with the separation is expected to be managed with an existing program and funds generated as a result of the separation.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our first quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27.", "With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The first question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Your line is open.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey, I guess, kind of looking back at 2016 and core sales growth, it was almost 50-50 divided between price mix and volume, is that the right way to think about 2017 as it relates to Food Care and Product Care growth at 3%, and off the (24:22) volume bucket for Food Care and Product Care, those two businesses, how much do you think will come from new products, OptiDure, Darfresh on Tray and all the many new products, Jerome, that introduced in Product Care late last year? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, good question. And no, I don't think that is going to be \u2013 the growth is going to be 50-50. I think that the growth is going to \u2013 actually the way we're seeing the growth is definitely more towards volume growth than price mix. That's mainly how we see it happen. We are dealing with the resin price which is flattish, it's coming up in the first quarter and so \u2013 but we believe that those are going to come down during the year. So, it really is volume growth that we're looking at.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Appreciate all the details. I guess if you could go back to the prior quarter and what your internal views might have been for 2017, and as we then fast forward to the current time, Jerome, what if anything has changed the most for you either positively or negatively in terms of the outlook for 2017, recognizing volume is going to be, in your view, an important contributor to top line growth, are there any other elements to your strategy that you might be working a little bit more aggressively this year, given that you said that you weren't entirely happy with the performance in 2016, as well. Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, George. Good question again. And no, I am not happy. I am not happy with the growth that we had, and I am disappointed. Why? Because we didn't have a very strong \u2013 we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter, it's improving somewhat in the fourth quarter, but it is not at the levels that I was expecting, and yes, indeed we have been surprised by a few things. Number one is the global GDP, you go to Bloomberg on February 2016 and you see that global GDP was forecasted at 2.4%, and it ended up \u2013 global ended up at 1.9% with the U.S. at 2.4% also, which ended up also at 1.9%, and Europe, which was forecasted at 1.9% and it is at 1.6%.", "And for 2017, the trend seems to be the same. Last year 2017 was seen to have a global GDP forecast, for 2017, a year ago, at 2.6%, and today's projection is 2.3%. So, we can't ignore those kind of things and what has disappointed me is the lack of industrial GDP growth. In a world economy, which had 1.9% global GDP growth, this is probably one of the worst years that we have experienced in many years actually. And it's always next year which is supposed to be better, but you know what? We're not counting on it. And in our forecast at this point in time, we are considering that the industrial world is not going to be better, and if it comes as a good surprise, well be it, we'd love that.", "Back in June of 2015, during Analyst Day, almost two years ago now, or 18 months ago, we were seeing a macro world which was going to be better. The reality is that in 2016, LatAm has been much worse than we thought it was going to be. And again, industrial market has been much softer. So that's how we plan.", "What am I happy with? Very frankly, we have invested a lot of money in new products and in R&D and marketing, to position new products. At Pack Expo late October, we have shown and we have announced quite a few innovations, which are disruptive and are going to make an impact. But what you had seen at that time, for several of those equipments, our products which \u2013 it was the first production, so we launched at that time and now in 2017 we have to ramp up those things. The thing that we all need to understand is that we're doing very different things that we were doing a few years ago.", "A few years ago, we were launching just simple products. Today, we're launching solutions, we're launching equipment, razor/razor blade, those are higher margin products, but the issue of this is that it takes a little bit of \u2013 the sales cycle is a little bit longer. When you work with meat processors and retail chains, in Europe, in North America, to establish Darfresh on Tray are those kinds of extraordinary solutions, which have a very, very clear mega trend, it just takes time, and we have talked about that. We have talked that with some of those retailers, the cycle between the first time we talk about that \u2013 about such a product or a solution and the production or the goal that's produced after ordering the equipment, this is two years.", "And it's the same on Product Care. One thing was to sell a little inflatable machine, and another thing is to do operational excellence with our e-commerce partners and improve all the organization and show them how much value they can create out of StealthWrap, FloWrap and I-Pack, and those kind of things. So I'm disappointed with the overall world economy support. I'm extraordinarily excited, which is why during the year 2016, we have invested so much money in R&D and in marketing to position those new solutions, because I really believe that this is disruptive, and our expected growth is probably delayed just \u2013 has probably been delayed by a few quarters, but I'll conclude, because this is very key, that we've seen an acceleration of the volume growth in Sealed Air in the fourth quarter.", "We had the highest volume growth in Food Care of each \u2013 of all the quarters in 20 \u2013 in the fourth quarter, same for Diversey. And almost the same, we had a very strong third quarter in Product Care, but same \u2013 almost the same in Product Care.", "So it's absolutely not doom and gloom, but we have to be realistic, and 2017 is going to be mostly about volume. And talking about Diversey, let me remind you what I said earlier, it is going to be our fastest growth business, fastest growth year, if you exclude the short-term impact of the SCJ.", "And we told you why this agreement did not get renewed is that it was not fitting either company. We wanted access to wider markets, to consumer markets, to all kind of, do-it-yourself type of market, and SCJ didn't want that.", "And therefore, we agreed to disagree. Yes, it does have a short-term impact, but this was really the right thing to do for the company. We have lots of great plans in place, and you're going to see outside of this SCJ business, we're going to have the highest growth that we ever had in Diversey here.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, Jerome. Good morning, Carol.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning, Scott.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just looking back at the presentation from late last year, when you talked about the spin transaction for the Diversey business. And obviously, it was a tax-free spin, and you mentioned in the release, you are including possibly doing a potential sale. I mean, are you okay, potentially realizing the lower proceeds simply due to tax leakage for the business now, just because it does maybe get you to your goal of simplifying the operating structure, or how should we think about that?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Well, the way you should think about this is that we're going to be counting properly and that we're going to do what is the best for our shareholders. And, I'm not announcing a sale, well, I am saying that we are pursuing to do it right here.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Yes. The next question is from Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Your line is open.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Just one quick question on resin cost. I mean what are your expectations for 2017? I mean, they seem to be staying higher than expected and the case would not be, what oil prices do, or whether we'll see a decline in the second half of the year. So, how you combat in those rise in resin costs?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So the market is choppy, you've seen that, that there's been increases in September, which were given back two months later. You see that the $0.05 in February is going through. We'll have to see whether the $0.06 (34:56) is going through, you'll have ethylene prices which are high, you have turnarounds, which are fabulously orchestrated. And at the very same time, you'll have some high capacity, or lots of capacity which is coming later in the year.", "So our view on the full year is that our \u2013 that prices are going to be flattish, and formula prices have a little bit of lag, is this going to impact the first half? A little bit with those price increases announced, yes, but for the whole year, we are counting on flat sales, which is why, by the way, we are not going to \u2013 we are not having a lot of price in our growth forecast, we have price mix, but we don't have very much of that. What you have to know is that we're very diligent. We have announced the pricing increase effective March 1 in our Product Care business, we're looking at systematic price product line by line, it's not going to apply across the board, because it's going to apply to polyethylene based products and we don't have only polyethylene based products in Product Care. We're looking at similar things where we don't have formulas in other \u2013 in other divisions, and by definition, we're not in the business of absorbing those cost increases.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Just one on the SC Johnson agreement. Can you just talk about what the adverse impact on Diversey's EBITDA is from termination of that relationship, and how the new Diversey pro forma EBITDA now compares to the $305 million that you laid out, when you announced the spin? Thank you.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, well, we have never given and we're not going to be giving the specific detail on this contract, but I have \u2013 I have said that we are expecting 1% sales growth and flattish EBITDA in 2017 out of Diversey Care as a result of this. Given that we are having under non-Diversey Care \u2013 non-SC Johnson business we're having higher growth than what we had in total in 2017 \u2013 in 2016.", "Operator", "The next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to clarify a couple things on the 2017 outlook. Carol, first I think I heard you mention it was probably a $10 million basis adjustment in the way that you're calculating EBITDA for 2017, that's a negative on there. Then why not give a range on it, given some of the uncertainty out there? You know, historically, I think, you'd given maybe a $20 million range, is it kind of appropriate to think about it as a $10 million range around the point estimate? And then, just finally, on the first quarter, usually at least in 2016, you saw about a $40 million drop in EBITDA from 4Q to 1Q, are you thinking about a sort of a similar amount of seasonality this year? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Brian. Yes, we highlighted that if you looked at it apples-to-apples and how interest expense \u2013 our interest income would be treated, the 1180 (38:32) would be $10 million higher, including interest income. So we've made that change in our guidance and we'll reflect that in our actual results as we move forward. If you want to have a number for comparison purposes, the interest income that was included in the adjusted EBITDA reported for 2016 is $13 million of positive interest income. And we'll reflect that change in Q1.", "With respect to providing a range, we just felt that it was probably cleaner to pick a point of the $1.18 billion and work towards that, it helps with our modeling, as well as yours and our investors to do that, so that's what we've done. And then just we highlighted and called out the various moving pieces, and I think, one of the changes versus maybe what you were looking at before is definitely on the share count and the currency and SCJ, all three of those are causing a bit of headwind, if you look at probably street expectations versus the numbers that we've reported this morning as our outlook.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So what you're having here is in 2017, we have included basically $50 million of negative, and it's $40 million from currency, and it is $10 million \u2013 actually it's more, it's $13 million on the interest income. So you have $53 million right there.", "And then next to that, you'll have a very transparent explanation of a flat Diversey Care in terms of EBITDA for the simple reason in constant currency \u2013 flat EBITDA, for the simple reason that we have a temporary situation with these consumer goods contracts. And this compares to a double-digit EBITDA growth in constant currency every single year in the last four years in Diversey Care. So that's what's going on.", "And should currency be better than the $40 million impact? We're going to be obviously happy about this. It is pretty choppy, remember, the euro was at $1.03 four weeks ago, three-and-a-half weeks, it is at $1.07, and those kind of things. You have quite a few movements of currency at this point in time. But you have $53 million of negatives right away as I just compared those two things on interest income, and currency.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "And Brian with respect to your question about Q1 2017, we did highlight in our comments that we do expect it to be the low point in terms of EBITDA earnings in 2017, and we will accelerate as we move throughout the year.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Tyler Langton of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on the currencies, I don't know if I missed it, but could you just give some details on, I guess, what rates you are assuming in your guidance and then, I think Carol you mentioned the euro sensitivity, but could you give any sensitivity around your exposure to the other currencies? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yes. So if we look at for 2017, we have assumed the euro at $1.05 and the great British pound at $1.25. Those would be two of the major currencies, and I called out the percentages in my comments that the euro represents about 18% of net sales and the British pound was 5%. The next highest currency that reflects \u2013 that impacts us is the Australian dollar at 4% of our net sales. And we're assuming a rate of $1.33 for 2017.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Yes. The next question is from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. Just a quick clarification question, I assume the comment around looking at strategic alternatives, you just limited at Diversey rather than entire company, and I guess, separately, just given the growth you're seeing in 2017 from new products, the beef cycle turning and just being done with pruning on the industrial side, I would have thought mix would have contributed more in 2017? Can you just talk about how you think about mix the next few years? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "If you just give a little bit of more color to the question, specific question? Mix, what kind of mix are you referring to?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Referring to Change the Game, Jerome, in terms of price mix in 2017?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. So, we're not giving those kind of details of price mix for existing products or new product, et cetera. Generally speaking, what you have to consider is that our solution based offering is having higher margins because as we are creating, with some of our solutions, extraordinary value for our customers, we are in a mode of sharing those. And we have glowing examples of those and when you take products like OptiDure where you have less flickers at the production level, where you have more additional sales because of the shine of the product and tightness in the vacuum. When you have Darfresh on Tray, which reduces dramatically the shrink at the retailer level, and it improves the shelf life and therefore, the supply chain.", "When you have products like FloWrap and StealthWrap, whose number one benefit are \u2013 and I-Pack, number one benefit are to reduce the shipping costs, because they generate less Cube, which is by the way in e-commerce, the number one cost. When you take the whole packaging operation, the number one cost is freight, is shipping cost. So when you can improve all of those kind of things, you are in a position to obviously enjoy better margins if you can demonstrate those value. So that's how we're going. But having said that, we're not giving details on the margins of existing products versus the new products, although during our Investor Day in September, we'll be able to give an update of how we're progressing and with our Change the Game offering.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Just a question on Product Care. A third of that business is e-commerce, third-party logistics that's presumably growing double digits. Can you help us square that with the 1.5% overall volume growth in the Q? And then maybe just following up on Phil's question, if I look at the three businesses for the year, Product Care had the best volume growth but the weakest price/mix. Is that a case where some of the new sales gains in e-commerce are coming from lower margin products or any color you can give there will be helpful?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yes, you're correct that the volume growth in Product Care total year has been 1.4% in 2016 versus 1% in Food Care. It's not like this in the fourth quarter because it was Food Care, which had the highest growth. Having said that, the price/mix has also been different, and the price/mix has been more unfavorable every single quarter during 2016. And this is because we don't have price formula. So depending on the mix and also depending on the type of products or resin prices, we have to adapt our pricing in a very different way because those are very different businesses with our customers there.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. I have just one question on Diversey, but there's a couple little pieces to it. First, the $250 million or so you did this year, remind us, because I forget, what the corporate allocation element is in there, so what should I think the real kind of EBITDA number is.", "And then if I heard you correctly, earlier in the call you said that share repurchase would be sort of on hold until you made a decision or got some clarity there, whether it's a spin or sale. And I guess then the last piece is timing. Has anything changed from it being a third quarter event?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay, So, Chris, I'll start with respect to allocation. The costs that sit within the businesses that you see within our segment reporting, they primarily represent the cost to operate that business, and that's true for all three of the businesses. So I would not think about it having a huge amount or even a mid-sized amount of allocation that's not needed to support the business. We've made a decision all along that we keep a lot of the more corporate-type costs, they sit in that other category where we have corporate and the Other Medical and New Ventures small business. So what sits there within the segment is largely what it requires for that business to operate within Sealed Air. And then with respect to the separation itself, we've referenced the second half, and there is really not a lot more we can say on that separation. It's proceeding as Jerome has described.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Yes. The next question is from Jason Freuchtel of SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "In terms of your free cash flow guidance, I think total cash restructuring expectations over the course of 2016 and 2017 came down relative to what you previously indicated. Is the difference primarily being driven by the separation of Diversey Care and will restructuring payments go away in 2018? And then additionally for CapEx, is $185 million an appropriate level to assume going forward for just the Food Care and Product Care segments?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. So, Jason, thank you. With respect to the restructuring, you're correct. The amounts are lower than what we had originally forecast even as late as Q3. And you're also correct that it is largely driven by the separation plans. I made the comment on our Q3 earnings call that we would manage initial cost within the existing program, as it related to starting to address some of the stranded costs, and that's what we've looked at.", "We've also been very diligent about going through the programs and prioritizing based on what could give a near-term return and also recognizing that separation of a business of this size for New Diversey also takes commitment and focus. And we want to make sure we optimize value for the shareholder and we continue great service for our customers. So that's also caused prioritization, and it decreased the amount we spent in 2016 and shifting to 2017. In total, the amount for restructuring is not changing. We would expect to have some spend in 2018, but also savings in 2018 based on this shift. But we will be taking a hard look as we move throughout the first half at this program and what will add the most value for Sealed Air.", "With respect to the CapEx, we'll provide more color on forecasted CapEx for Food Care and for Product Care post identification of the separation.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah. Good morning, Jerome. Good morning, Carol and Lori.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Just wanted to swing back to the Product Care business and can we get some sense of whether in general the e-commerce business right now has lower margins than the segment overall? And then also, I'm just kind of curious why volume isn't a little bit better given that we're seeing things like the ISM Index for manufacturing pickup, we're seeing some pickup in other forms of industrial packaging, so maybe your thoughts there.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. So what Product Care has clearly suffered from is from the mix between industrial and e-commerce and 3PL. Let me address the second part of your question first, which is the Index. Yes, in general speaking, we can see some ratios, which are hanging in there. The reality is that we have the bulk of our business, about 85% of our business, is in North America and is in Europe. And when you look at those two parts of the world and when you talk with our customers, and very frankly on the industrial part, their exports and their business is suffering, and it's just sluggish.", "When you have the U.S. with a GDP of 1.9%, all driven by consumers, you can call this an industrial GDP boom or these kind of things. And as I said, the bulk of our Product Care business is in North America and in Europe. So that's the way it is.", "Unfortunately, we have a large part of our Product Care business in there. Fortunately, we're growing very fast in the 3PL and e-commerce business, and the solutions that we have are absolutely second to none, disruptive, and revolutionary. Thus every time we are engaged with new customers, we are going through a whole process of new value being created and working on how we can go and get the kind of things done.", "And now addressing your first question, which was related to the margins of e-commerce versus industrial. Yes, indeed with our current portfolio, they are slightly lower. But with the solutions that we have shown at Pack Expo, they are going to be definitely improving and not lagging our industrial business.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. The final question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you. I just wanted to get back to the volume side. You seem somewhat confident in there, and maybe you can just discuss how that works out by region. North America and Europe have seen decent gains in both Food Care and Product Care, but the non-U.S. is still pretty concerning. How do you see that playing out next year? Do you see continued drags in Latin America and Australia, and then also in Europe in Product Care? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "It seems that your question started with Food Care and so...", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. I just wanted to see if you can go through both if possible. Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Sure. So in Food Care, we're seeing continually strong growth out of North America. We had negative volume in Latin America, actually very negative in Brazil, positive in some other parts of Latin America, but for a total being negative. We believe that this is going to be stabilized. When we look at the herd and type of the cattle cycle, we are seeing that, specifically in Brazil, we're seeing that it has hit the trough in 2016. We believe that the first half of the year is going to be somewhat flattish, and that it is going to start to improve in the second half of 2017.", "When you look at Australia, 2017 is going to be lower than 2016. Again, we are following very closely their herd size. The herd size is being rebuilt in 2017. It has dramatically come down in 2016 for all the reasons that we talked about. And when you think about the herds in 2014, it was 29 million head, and in 2016 it was about 26.2 million. And this has been a huge reduction and the slaughter rate has dramatically decreased.", "We believe that it is going to continue in 2017 at lower a pace but it's going to continue, and definitely as the herd is being rebuilt from 2016 in 2017 and onwards, towards 2021, we believe that the business in Australia, the slaughter rate is going to increase, and as you know, it's a positive from 2018.", "So what we see is that from 2018, we're going to have the three big parts of the world which are exporting, et cetera, which are Latin America, Australia, and North America be on an up cycle, and that's going to be definitely very positive of that.", "To be noted also is that the exports out of Brazil are improving, but you have to remember that about 88% of the Brazilian beef exports are frozen and 12% are fresh. The good news is that fresh is expanding with the approval to export to the U.S. and will open to Asian markets as well.", "So on Product Care, we think we have a huge momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. We're going to be showing more of the partnership agreements that we have in the second quarter with very important ones. And so we're doing great things. It is going great and we are going to be showing, we believe, nice growth in the 3PL, e-commerce in North America.", "The European business has been negative in the fourth quarter. Disappointing, definitely led by our industrial business in Europe. The whole question is how do we mitigate with e-commerce and 3PL the flattish trends in industrial. And our view is that we shouldn't count on industrial increase in 2017, and preserve our position there at the very same time, continue to aggressively grow the businesses which have momentum and in which we're very disruptive.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, that ends our conference call for today. Thank you every one for joining.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Mark and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President Investor Relations. Please proceed ma'am.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 11:00 AM today.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I am proud to report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stayed focused on our objectives and our three division and functions performed extremely well. For the full-year 2015, we delivered 3% organic sales growth with favorable price mix in every division and in every region.", "Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 230 basis points. Our productivity metric, which is the ratio between our operating expenses to our gross profit, improved from 65% in 2014 to 60% in 2015. And if you look at our operational results excluding FX and the impact of 2015 divestitures, our net sales increased $217 million and our EBITDA increased by $212 million. That is impressive and something to be proud of.", "Our free cash flow in 2015 was $595 million, which excluded $184 million in CapEx, which included \u2013 sorry, $184 million in CapEx and $98 million in restructuring. And we returned $802 million to shareholders through share repurchases and still have $884 million remaining under our current authorization.", "Our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is well under way and you can see the financial benefits from Get Fit programs over the last few years. Some of our Get Fit successes include a tight control and strategic alignments, pricing discipline, targeted R&D investments, gross margin expansion, productivity improvements, and working capital management, and there is still a lot to be done. In Supply Chain, for example, our Get Fit efforts are changing and simplifying how and where we operate to deliver improvements in cost of goods sold, cash management and service. Over the last 24 months, we have consolidated 9% of our total facilities, with another planned incremental reduction of 5% over the next 12 months to 18 months. We have reduced our total active SKUs by 30% since 2013, and we will continue to optimize SKUs going forward.", "In the past two years, we have been able to cut our cash conversion cycle by a third, largely through better management of payables and receivables. We have clear targets and will continue making progress in 2016 and beyond with a more concerted effort on inventory management. Our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will ensure that we are consistently realizing operational efficiency. This is the power of being and staying focused. And believe me, our Get Fit program has many more good days ahead.", "At our Analyst Day back in June 2015, we provided a detailed investment plan for Change the Game. Our early successes validate the long-term potential of these growth opportunities. In Food Care, for example, demand for Darfresh on Tray in Europe has exceeded our expectations, and our rollout in North America is up to a very solid start. Our recently introduced barrier technology, OptiDure, is also seeing similar market acceptance in Europe, and there is already meaningful interest globally.", "In Diversey Care, the acquisition of Intellibot has given us first-mover advantage in the robotics flow care equipment market. We are also delivering on our commitment to bringing sustainable solutions to hygiene industry with our 100% biodegradable plant-based SURE solutions and there are more solutions like this under development.", "And in Product Care, our automated solutions including B+ and FloWrap are gaining traction and positioning us as our customers' trusted consumable and equipment partner. We will execute in 2016 with the same mindset as in 2015. We will deliver profitable growth and maximize free cash flow by focusing on execution and operational excellence. We will stay disciplined on our value-added selling approach and we will continue investing in next-generation, disruptive technologies.", "And before I get into the details of our results, I want to highlight something that I am very passionate about. And that is sustainability being at the service of financial performance. Companies with sustainability at the forefront of what they do every day are long-term financial winners in tomorrow's world. At Sealed Air, sustainability is at the very core of what we do, how we innovate and how we invest. As such, following the COP 21 agreement in mid-December in Paris, we joined the group of companies who clearly wanted to commit. We pledged to disclose both the total financial impact and the environmental benefits of all new product introductions to our customers.", "Proving our leadership, we were recognized for the second consecutive year by CDP for our sustainability efforts and have been awarded a position in CDP's climate indices which puts us in the top 10% of global S&P companies. We were listed in CDP's Supplier A lists, and received 100% disclosure score compared to an average of 84% for the other companies reporting.", "With that said, let me turn to our fourth quarter and year-end results by region and by division, and then I will pass the call to Carol for more details on our financials, including our outlook for 2016. On slide four, we present our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales of $1.75 billion, were up 2% on an organic basis, which excludes currency and the Food Care divestitures in North America and in Europe.", "Let's start with EMEA. We delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter with favorable trend in some of our largest Western European countries and continued growth in Russia and Turkey. These results were achieved despite anemic GDP growth throughout Europe and a slowdown in emerging markets. Our performance in EMEA is a direct result of our pragmatic decision to realign our organizational structure, enabling our divisions to be well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.", "In North America, organic sales were relatively flat, with 5% growth in Diversey Care and a slight increase in Food Care, offset by a decline in Product Care. Asia Pacific was also relatively flat compared to last year. We experienced 2% to 3% constant dollar growth in Australia and New Zealand, which was offset by some softness in China and other Asian countries. Australia and New Zealand combined account for approximately 6% of our net sales, and China approximately 3%.", "Latin America was hit the hardest with currency devaluation, declining 18% on an as-reported basis and increasing 7% in constant dollars. Constant dollar growth in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil were attributable to increased demand in our Food Care business. These three countries combined account for about 7% of our total net sales.", "And as presented on slide five, the trends we experienced for the full year are consistent with the comments I just provided for the fourth quarter. We delivered $7 billion in net sales, an increase of 3% on an organic basis, with growth in every region.", "On slide six, we outline our price mix, volume, and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis. We had favorable price mix in every region throughout the year, with the exception of North America in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with this performance, given the declines in resin and our formula pricing structure in our Food Care business.", "Our results demonstrate the rate of adoption of our advanced portfolio and how our customers are clearly valuing our offering. At Sealed Air, everything we do and everything we bring to market not only meet the highest criteria for sustainability requirements, but is designed with the most advanced technologies to help our customers improve productivity and save cost. That is an attractive value proposition in today's global economy.", "Turning to our performance by division, on slide seven, Food Care sales increased 3% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of favorable price mix and higher volumes. By region, we delivered 2% and 1% organic growth in EMEA and North America, respectively. Latin America was up 12% in constant dollars, and Asia Pacific was slightly up.", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on an organic basis. Margins of 18.7% expanded 120 basis points compared to last year. Throughout 2015, in every quarter, in every region, we delivered positive organic growth and outpaced our end markets. In addition to what I highlighted earlier on Darfresh on Tray and OptiDure, we are seeing increased demand for ready meals and our fluid-based solutions.", "We have three effective systems operating in three regions around the world and, heading into year-end, equipment sales were strong. This is a strong indication of the strength underlying our Food Care packaging business. Our hygiene business, our direct in hygiene business, our direct food contact chemical solution, designed to improve food safety and extend shelf life, is really gaining traction with our key customers.", "This quarter, our team in Asia Pacific was awarded a Darfresh Vacuum Skin Packaging, or VSP, contract for red meat, poultry, and seafood with a large supermarket chain. This breakthrough solution increases operational efficiency, extends shelf life, reduces food waste, and differentiates this customer from their competition through brand building. This is the first introduction of Darfresh VSP in this region.", "Before I highlight our full-year results and 2016 outlook for Food Care, let me briefly provide you with an update on what we're seeing in the North America beef market, which was down approximately 5% in the fourth quarter and also 5% for the full-year 2015.", "Industry data points suggest that we are at the bottom in North America, and there is evidence that the market is on track to turn positive in the second half of 2016. Going forward, we're well positioned to continue outperforming the capital market in North America as production increases, and we continue to penetrate existing and new customers with our advanced portfolio across all proteins and adjacent markets.", "For the full year, Food Care net sales declined 11% as reported, but increased 4% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.3% expanded 280 basis points. And as on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%; excluding unfavorable currency and divestitures, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% on an organic basis for the full year.", "In 2016, we expect Food Care to deliver net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth on an organic basis and margin expansion. We expect volume trends in the second half to be stronger, as we reap the benefits of the beef cycle turning positive in North America.", "Slide eight highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant-dollar basis were approximately 3% up in the fourth quarter. We had favorable price mix in every region and volume growth in EMEA, North America, and Asia Pacific. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.2% increased 9% on a constant-dollar basis. So across all regions in Diversey Care, even in Latin America where the volume is the most challenging, we have improved the overall quality of the operations. We are investing in disruptive technologies and have reshaped our product portfolio with a keen focus on sustainability, productivity and the integration of chemicals, tooling and machinery.", "We have focused our sales and marketing efforts on our core vertical markets, including hospitality, healthcare, facility management, food services, and retail. This approach is enabling us to grow our core business and consistently win new customers. In fact, we recently had strategic wins in North America in facilities management, as a result of our focus on total cost of ownership and strength in our solutions offerings.", "You can see the results of our efforts in the performance of North America and EMEA regions, both of which have delivered constant dollar growth throughout 2015 after years of declining sales. And in the fourth quarter, North America was up 5% and EMEA was up 3% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific, where we have solid footing, continued to have favorable performance and delivered 2.5% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter.", "Our pipeline for our Intellibot machines continues to grow and we have over 200 machines operating today in the field. We are integrating the advanced robotics capabilities of the Intellibot into our leading TASKI floor care equipment. I can assure you that we have learned a lot about robotics from that acquisition.", "We also continue to see strong demand in healthcare for our Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide or AHP technology with products like Oxivir.", "For the full year, Diversey Care net sales increased 3% in constant dollars, also on an as-reported basis, it declined 8%. This division was hit the hardest by currency devaluations. We continued our commitment to support our core growth and Change the Game initiatives by making substantial targeted investments in sales, marketing and R&D, including the acquisition of Intellibot.", "Even with these increased investments, we still delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth in constant dollars and margins of 11.6%. And going forward in 2016, we expect favorable sales and EBITDA trends in Diversey Care on a constant-dollar basis and margin expansion. We will continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and manage our cost structure to help offset currency headwinds.", "Let me now turn to Product Care results on slide nine. Product Care net sales declined 3% in constant dollars in the quarter and 1% for the full year. As you know, rationalization efforts have been ongoing over the last 12 months. Our efforts in Latin America for the most parts are behind us and we look forward to rebuilding our business in that region.", "In North America, effective in January of this year, we divested another $15 million of a product line. In EMEA, our rationalization efforts are still underway and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. If you look at our Product Care business on a global basis, excluding rationalization, it is performing well ahead of our expectations. Throughout 2015, we experienced double-digit growth in e-Commerce and third-party logistics and significantly improved our profitability in general packaging. We changed leadership in both Asia Pacific and Latin America and are already seeing the benefits of our new go-to-market approach.", "It is worth noting that across all of our end markets, including the industrial segment, which has been relatively soft, we had strong equipment placements heading into year-end. This is an indication of future growth and we look forward to capturing that opportunity as the year progresses.", "Our adjusted EBITDA performance really tells the 2015 story for Product Care. In the quarter, Product Care delivered margins of 21.5%, a 360 basis points improvement compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 basis points to nearly 21%. And on a constant-dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% in the quarter and for the full year. While some of these growth and margin expansion is the result of lower input cost, more of the improvement came from our rationalization efforts, pricing disciplines and an increasing mix of global performance packaging solutions.", "In 2016, we expect volume growth to improve throughout the year, as we complete our rationalization efforts and continue increasing our penetration into the rapidly growing fulfillment market. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect continued constant dollar growth and margin expansion.", "And now, let me pass the call back to Carol to review our net sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow, and outlook. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 10 and 11; let me walk you through out net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year. Starting with net sales on slide 10, we delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7 billion for the year. On an organic basis, sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter and 3% for the full year.", "Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix, which was 1.6% or $32 million in the quarter and 2.3% or $176 million for the full year. Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $190 million in the quarter and $764 million for the full year.", "In 2015, approximately 18% of our total sales were exposed to the euro. In the quarter and for the full year, divestitures impacted net sales $64 million and $172 million respectively.", "Turning to slide 11, for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $282 million or 16.1% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unfavorable currency translation was $30 million, and the impact from divestitures was $11 million.", "On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 15%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $40 million, and restructuring savings of $16 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year to $1.17 billion or 16.7% of net sales. Unfavorable currency was $126 million and the impact from divestitures was a negative $33 million. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 19%. This increase was primarily due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $185 million, as well as restructuring savings of $60 million.", "The increase in SG&A and other expenses of $44 million was primarily related to higher, non-material inflation costs. We delivered a 230 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, medical and corporate expenses, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables, was a net expense of approximately $69 million as compared to a net expense of $90 million in 2014. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the strong performance in our medical business.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full-year 2015. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.11 for the quarter and $0.38 for the year. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower adjusted tax rate and share repurchases. The adjusted tax rate for Q4 2015 was 8% as compared with 9% for Q4 2014. For the full-year, our adjusted tax rate was 20% as compared with 22% for 2014, contributing approximately $0.06 to the year-over-year EPS improvement.", "In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded foreign tax credits that previously were considered not recognizable. In 2015, we repurchased 16.1 million shares for a total value of $802 million. For the full-year, the average diluted shares outstanding were 207 million compared to 214 million shares in the same period a year ago.", "Our share buyback had a favorable impact of $0.09 on 2015 adjusted EPS, as compared to 2014. We have $884 million remaining on our share repurchase program. We ended the year towards the low end of our target leverage ratio of 3.5 times to 4 times. We believe this leverage range is optimal given our solid and recurring free cash flow.", "Turning to slide 12; free cash flow was a source of $595 million in 2015, excluding the tax refund associated with the settlement agreement. Cash interest payments were $224 million and CapEx was $184 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of $50 million in 2015. We have made meaningful progress over the last few years achieving our operating working capital target of 15% of net sales based on a 13-month average. This is a 200 basis point improvement as compared to the same period a year ago. And as Jerome noted, there is still opportunity for us to improve inventory management.", "Turning to slide 13; we present our outlook for 2016. We expect net sales to be approximately $6.8 billion, a 3.5% increase on an organic basis. On an as reported basis, unfavorable currency is expected to be $400 million. We anticipate approximately $250 million of this unfavorable currency in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacts the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we anticipate net sales in the first quarter to be approximately $1.6 billion.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2016 is expected to be in the range of approximately $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% to 9% on an organic basis. On an as reported basis, we are estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $65 million. We anticipate nearly $40 million of this unfavorable FX in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacts the first quarter.", "Keep in mind that we will have our toughest year-over-year comparison for Food Care in the first quarter 2016 due to currency headwinds, the impact from the divestitures, and formula pricing. On an organic basis, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be down slightly. We expect sequential improvement for the remainder of the year.", "For the full year, we expect Food Care to deliver organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full-year 2016, as we continue to invest in our next-generation technologies, including sensing, data analytics, and our digital platform, and make further progress on our global ERP rollout.", "Our adjusted EBITDA in Q1 is estimated to be approximately $245 million. We expect EBITDA to improve sequentially for the remainder of the year. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million.", "Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. The adjusted EPS unfavorable impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.18. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2016 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 24%.", "Our free cash flow in 2016 is estimated to be $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which is in line with the estimate we provided at our Analyst Day in June. Included in the $275 million is approximately $100 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $40 million is associated with other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $135 million. Cash restructuring payments are expected to be $110 million.", "We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million in 2016, and we'll have higher savings in 2017. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. We anticipate working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.", "In closing, we are confident that we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions, where there are growth opportunities for Sealed Air. We are not ignoring the global environment around us, and we will continue to implement continuous improvement processes to ensure we realize further operational efficiencies. Our focus on new product adoption and investment in disruptive technologies will drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years to come.", "Before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our first quarter 2016 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 28, at 10 AM. With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please proceed.", "Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Scott.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just first question around Latin America, because I think in the quarter, if I looked at the slides correctly, it was up 10% organically in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that? Are you seeing anything in the economic environment that makes you concerned that that growth rate is not sustainable?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Latin America has been a difficult continent throughout 2015, especially as devaluations in the second half have increased. Everybody knows the situation in Brazil, and we have dramatically suffered from our positions in Venezuela, but that's what it is. Having said that, we have some very strong bright spots, especially in Argentina, which has been one of the countries where we've been growing the most in local currency and in dollars in 2015. So, in the end, the environment is what it is. We have been slightly impacted in our Food Care business. We have restructured our product business \u2013 Product Care business, so we \u2013 the comparables are not easy to make here, because we have gotten rid of some very low-quality business.", "And in Diversey Care, we have had some spotty difficulties, including the countries I have mentioned, especially Venezuela and so. But altogether, we are fairly confident that we have hit the trough in these countries.", "In Food Care, we believe that in Latin America, outperformed the market despite the volume declines. There's a very strong interest in our new products introduction in countries like Argentina, Mexico and Brazil for example.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please proceed.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning, and first off, congrats on the strong finish to 2015.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ghansham. Good morning.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. I guess my question relates to the 2016 organic growth rate of 3.5%, which is clearly an acceleration over the second half 2015 run rate, even with the macro presumably more challenging. I guess what gives you more confidence on that type of outlook? And how does that break out between volume and price mix? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, it's interesting, it seems that everybody is rattled about (35:52) the economies. I would say the financial markets are pretty (36:00), one week it's oil, another week it's China, another week it's the banks, et cetera. I am not that negative. We are \u2013 we had growth of \u2013 when apples-to-apples, we had 2.8% growth in 2015. We have an objective of growing 3.5% plus and very frankly, I am very pleased with what I'm seeing with our new products and I could go and take them division-by-division.", "So, we have our Food Care business, which is going to be helped in the second half of the year by the massive cattle situation that we have talked in details about during our Investor Day saying that it was probably going to be coming the second half of 2016. And we definitely have now more confidence that it is clearly coming at that time. We have lots of very new products. We talked a lot about Darfresh on Tray. We talked a lot about OptiDure. We are \u2013 we have given you projections, 2018 projections for those type of products during our Investor Day. We are ahead of our schedule. We're very pleased. On Diversey Care, we're making very steady progress, substantial customer wins, very strong value proposition. Our Intellibot business is going well, our TASKI business is going well. Our positioning is very strong. Our Product Care has suffered from top-line growth in 2015. As we said earlier, we've divested from a little business in North America effective January 1. We are likely to conclude something else in Europe, which is not a quality business later in the first half. But our value proposition, the acquisition of B+, the launch of our FloWrap solutions, our new offerings are making me really confident.", "So, it's been a long answer. But very frankly, between 2.8% and 3.5%, given what we have is something that we should really be able to do. And this is in an economy which is not good, but when has it been good in the last three years?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, Ghansham, just specific to your question about volume versus price mix. It's more heavily weighted with more than half driven by volume.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please proceed.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Congratulations on the year and thanks for all the details. I had a point of clarification question, and then I wanted to touch on organic volumes for the year. So Carol, I just want to make sure I heard you right. You are forecasting the EBITDA for the quarter coming in \u2013 did I hear correctly, at $245 million, with food being down somewhat? And I guess by implication, the other segments being up? And then just comparatively, what was the prior year if I strip out divestitures and the like?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, George, on the \u2013 the $245 million is correct for the Q1 EBITDA forecast and driven mainly the decline by Food Care. So, yes, the implication is the other two would be up. And then on the divestitures, I guess \u2013 Lori, I'm trying to (40:00).", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "What we had for 2016, what we have is $18 million of \u2013 $18 million to $20 million in currency, and we've got about $18 million in divestitures.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. George, in Q1 of last year, it included \u2013 it has a North America and European trade divesture of $67 million. And on the bottom line, that impact is about $14 million in EBITDA. So $67 million on the top line and $14 million on the bottom line for Food Care. He had another question.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, is George still available? I think he had another question.", "Operator", "George is not available.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay. So, if George comes back in the queue, please let him in. Can we go to next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please proceed.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol, just on the FX assumptions, can you help us with what currency rates you are assuming for the full year? And how much different your sales and EBITDA guidance would be if you were taking today's rates as opposed to perhaps year-end rates?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. So, with respect to the assumptions we made, euro, we used $1.05. We recognized that's less than where the euro's at today, but there's still a lot of volatility out there. And we feel like that's a good prudent exchange rate for us to utilize with our guidance.", "We referenced that about 18% of our revenues were based in euro for 2015, so the math can be calculated there. For the ruble, we used $80.5; the Brazilian real, $4.33; Australian dollar, $1.44; the Great British pound, $1.45; and the Canadian dollar, $1.30.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, can you go to the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. On free cash flow, getting beyond the CapEx bump in 2016, is that $200 million CapEx guidance for 2017 that you gave at the Analyst Day and I think that was sort of your normalized range beyond 2017. Is that still intact or is there anything \u2013 whether it's divestitures or maybe being a little bit ahead of expectations on Change the Game that would change that kind of $200 million normalized range?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So let me just make a general comment. You have pointed, Anthony, exactly the right thing, which is, are we ahead or are we late compared to our forecast given at Investor Day. And outside of currency, we're ahead, and we stand \u2013 what did we say? We said 4% to 5% organic growth on the top line and we said that it was not going to be linear. And what did we just say? We said 3.5% for 2016 and we confirmed that it's not going to be linear. It's going to be improving over time, thanks to the ramp-up of our solutions which are really getting market traction.", "Then we said 7% to 8% growth of EBITDA over time. Over that period 2015 to 2018, with the goal of reaching EBITDA margins of 18% in 2018 and 20% in 2020. You'll remember that I also said that our goal was to align the year with the EBITDA percentage, well, thanks to \u2013 in 2015, we're ahead and we plan to continue to be ahead.", "So, all together, we're comfortable with the EBITDA growth guideline that we have given for that \u2013 in July \u2013 or in June of last year for 2015 to 2018. And definitely with the growth targets, we believe that we are ahead. And on your point on capital, Carol can comment. But, yes, indeed we're also confident with the guidance that we have given over the next three years for free cash flow as a result \u2013 including also as a result of the capital where we said that it was going to be $180 million to $200 million, if I remember.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, $180 million to $220 million, so averaging out about $200 million and we still feel like that's the right number given growth, investment opportunities that we're very confident we'll have those investments that will continue to drive Change the Game.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos. Please proceed.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "George?", "Operator", "George, please try to make sure your phone is not on mute.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay. You want to move to the next question, operator, please? Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes and good morning. Question has to do with the \u2013 just basically the free cash flow guidance. And I just wanted to really zero in on the tax situation. You mentioned, Carol, a tax rate of 24% and I wondered how much of that would be cash taxes in the sense that you might still have some carryover tax benefits from the settlement and maybe some other items. In other words, is that going to be all cash or do you think it'll be some benefits carryover that will reduce the cash tax rate?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, we \u2013 actually what we communicated, Chip, on Analyst Day is that our cash taxes will be going up as we move forward because we have utilized a lot of the benefits. So, our guidance at $125 million will be moving to $180 million is our estimate for 2018. So, we expect that to continue to increase as we go forward.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. This is Gabe Hajde, actually, sitting in for Chris. Wanted to touch on the raw material environment, sort of what your expectations are heading into the year, what's baked into guidance, and if there's any sort of benefit price-cost spread that you are looking at, that's baked into your number?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, are you saying long-term, or you \u2013 could you rephrase the question? Are you referring about the long-term environment, or just basically 2016?", "Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Well, Jerome, I mean, the more near-term question would be, what is assumed in your guidance? And given sort of what we're seeing with oil, where it is today, and increased capacity in polyethylene, is your long-term expectation that it could stay down here, in terms of resin, regardless of what happens with oil?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. So, we have baked in our forecast weak polyethylene prices, olefins prices, and these are already in our forecast. We're very close to those markets and, so far, they are developing as we thought they would be developing. So, we don't believe that there is much upside compared to what we have forecasted at this point in time.", "With regards to the overall environment, while we are on February 10, have been, year-to-date, to nine countries around the world. And my job is to have one eye on the microscope and one eye on the telescope. And I can assure you that I'm very close to what's going on. And I went to Asia, I went to Europe, traveled in North America, and I am seeing positive momentum altogether.", "So this painting things in black and white globally is \u2013 might be fashionable, but I just don't see it this way. I'm seeing that we have customers, and we have momentum with customers, and we have new customers who are interested in what we're doing, who want to eliminate food waste, who want to eliminate and optimize packaging, et cetera, who want to improve their food safety, who want to see productivity improvements in their operations in the Diversey Care, and they're looking at us as having the ability, the capability, the knowledge, the results, to bring them value-add decisions. And I must say, I'm pretty optimistic.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from BMA (sic) [BMO] (49:41) Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "That's BMO, thanks. Good morning, Carol. Good morning, Jerome.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "I wondered if you could just talk about sort of uses of cash in 2016. The stock is quite a bit cheaper now than your average price last year but, at the same time, probably acquisition multiples on businesses you might be interested in are probably coming down. So, just some thoughts on that.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So Mark, we've stated many times that, with respect to acquisitions, we do not have a huge focus to go out and acquire, something other than what could be considered a bolt-on or an added technology benefit for the company. And in fact, over the three-year planning horizon that we communicated on Analyst Day, we said we were estimating a total of approximately $400 million over that time period. Our acquisitions to-date have continued to be things that bring technology to the company, or expand market penetration capabilities with existing customers, and can help us win new customers. So that \u2013 our focus there won't change. Jerome has been very vocal about, with his experience, a lot of acquisitions just aren't successful and we're going to remain focused where we have core capabilities and we know we can bring successful financial results to our investors.", "With respect to looking at share repurchase, we were very active in 2015. We're confident in the price that we paid, that it's a good value over the long term. We work with the board, providing them various financial models around intrinsic value, Monte Carlo simulations based on our long-term forecasts. And while the price is extremely attractive right now, we'll continue to work with the board on what they think are the right actions for us to move forward with the remaining value of our share repurchase program. And we also will manage within that 3.5 times to 4 times leverage.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, let me add a little bit of color in here. We \u2013 my view on acquisition hasn't changed. There is a time for making large acquisitions, and there's a time for staying focused. 2016 is still, for us, the time to remain focused.", "We have a lot of value to capture through our ongoing \u2013 in 2016, in 2017 to our Get Fit programs, a lot. And we have a tremendous ramp-up on our innovation and of our Change the Game. Let's separate those two. Change the Game are highly disruptive innovations, they're not all of our innovations.", "And we are continuing to do small acquisitions, and those are technology targeted and we are very pleased \u2013 very, very pleased \u2013 with every single of those that we have done, they are very small companies, generally speaking they're start-ups, but we have done that. Are we going to do bigger ones in the years to come? Yeah, we probably will. Having said that, you want to do those when you have basically exhausted the bulk of your opportunity \u2013 organic opportunity \u2013 and we have so many opportunities, on what we are improving and doing, that we should not be distracted.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. The industrial economy is obviously quite weak. It's impressive you expect Product Care volumes to be up this year. Can you kind of parse out the opportunities you are seeing that's driving the growth, whether it's e-commerce or dim weight, and how trends are shaking for just the broader market? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. So, the industrial \u2013 as you seem to focus here on the Product Care, it is correct that industrial markets, and we have noted that in our packaging sales for industry and on exports for out of the year, we have noted softness. This is correct.", "You mentioned e-commerce. We have had double-digit growth. We continue to have double-digit growth and we're focusing a lot on dim-weight and on solutions, which can reduce damage and improve the volume of the boxes, et cetera.", "This is why we have acquired B+. This is why we have developed and launched our FloWrap technologies. They're having huge interest. We're working with integrators; we're working with lots of 3PLs and fulfillment companies and we are very excited by the discussions that we're having.", "The pipeline is absolutely tremendous. And there's not one company we go to who is not impressed with the way we approach the market because we can help them reduce dim weight or dimension in the packaging, and reduce the damage. And when you look at the cash cost of the packaging operation between the cost of the packaging, the cost of the fulfillment operation, which is fulfillment velocity, which is the manpower to pack, between transportation cost and between damage, out of those four cash costs, the smallest of the cost is the cost of the packaging.", "And therefore, you cannot isolate the cost of the packaging from the other three because this is how we can add the most value to our customers and extract, by the way, the most value to ourselves also. And we have a very strong equipment placement story here that we \u2013 which has been ramping up over the whole year of last year, and we are very optimistic that this is a very good time for 2016.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Jerome, I was wondering if you could give us a little (56:29) on the food side and compare what you're expecting in terms of growth rate in North America versus a decline in Australia. Have those kind of met one another and decline in Australia will be lower than the increase in North America?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Well, there are cycles, and you pointed to that cycle. And yes, the Australian beef cycle, which was growing double-digits in the first half in Food Care, was growing at a lower pace in the fourth quarter.", "Having said that, now, we believe that the Food Care North America upside is going to be stronger than the Food Care situation in Brazil. And then once again, you have cattle, but you also have pork, chicken, et cetera, and we are fairly positive for the other parts of the world with regards to pork production and chicken production.", "In the U.S., we believe that in the second half, given the fact that you have a lot of cattle which moved to feedlots, instead of all the signs out there that it's going to be a stronger year for protein. So that's on the market side. We have grown in a negative environment. We have grown in the U.S. in a minus 5% capital environment in 2015 and this is by adding solutions, value add solutions to our customers and therefore, we're very optimistic about what's going to happen in the second half of 2016.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, that's all we have time for this morning. Thank you, everyone for joining. Operator, I pass the call back to you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

(NYSE:SEE) Q1 2009 Earnings Call April 29, 2009 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Amanda Butler - Investor Relations", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "David H. Kelsey - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President", "Analysts", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Claudia Shank Hueston - JPMorgan Securities", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital", "Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital", "Operator", "Good morning everyone and welcome to the Sealed Air Conference Call discussing the company s First Quarter 2009 Results. This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. (Operator Instructions).", "And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you, Lisa. Good morning everyone.", "Before we begin our call today, I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. Our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. We've also posted supplemental financial information and reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP measures that we expect to discuss on our website at sealediar.com in the investor information section, under quarterly results.", "And now, I'll turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William V. Hickey", "Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone. I'm Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have David Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.", "During today's call, I will provide a few highlights on our business performance in the first quarter and will also discuss our 2009 guidance. Dave will then discuss details of our financial results. And after Dave's remarks, we will take your questions.", "Our first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.33 excluding the $0.01 charge for our global manufacturing strategy, reflected not only the benefits from stabilizing input costs, but also from the tremendous efforts of all our employees in this very difficult environment.", "Our stringent control of expenses and our management of price mix, combined with the benefits of our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and our global manufacturing strategy all made measurable contributions to our first quarter performance.", "These actions are particularly noteworthy in the face of declining market demand. Our efforts resulted in a 300 basis point increase in our gross profit margin, a 3% increase in operating profit and a 220 basis point increase in our operating margin. We accomplished this despite a 7% decline in sales excluding foreign currency exchange and a 12% decline in unit volumes.", "Both of these elements are due to slow economic conditions and a cyclical decline in animal production in the food packaging supply chain, not a change in our market position. Decline in unit volumes occurred in all regions and all businesses except in our Asia Pacific food business.", "Going into the quarter, we had anticipated volume declines due to the continuing weakening economic conditions and the forecast for a decline in animal production in the first half of 2009. However, the decline in industrial output in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, which drove lower unit volumes than we expected in our Protective Packaging and Specialty Material businesses in North America and in Europe.", "Having said that, our quarterly volume performance in these businesses appears to be generally in line with shipping proxies in the quarter and we have not seen any further destocking activity among our customers.", "Despite the volume challenges, we were successful in managing price mix in most of our businesses and across all regions, which resulted in a 4.2% or $49 million growth in price mix in the first quarter. We have maintained pricing in most of our products, but have lowered prices in a couple of product categories to meet certain competitive situations in selective regions of the world.", "In addition, we have opted to strategically walk away from some business to protect our margin performance, which did have a small additional unfavorable impact on our unit volumes.", "Our traditional growth areas faced challenges in this quarter due to business conditions. Case-Ready and vertical pouch packaging sales declined 9% and 4% respectively. However, these numbers do include the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Geographically, developing region sales did rise by 2%. Growth would have been higher if we were not for a 10% decline in sales in Brazil due to credit constraints facing meat processors and a slowdown in their beef exports to Europe.", "Additionally, an 18% decline in sales in China due to the rapid decline in local manufacturing and exports in the quarter contributed to the reduced growth rate.", "On a brighter note, Latin America excluding Brazil rose 17% and in Poland and Russia, we saw a slowdown in the rate of growth, but did achieve sales increases of 20 and 10% respectively. These figures exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "Looking at the segments in a little more detail, I would like to quickly highlight a few additional points.", "In our food packaging segment, we anticipated the decline in sales and unit volumes in the quarter due to the factors I previously mentioned.", "Our team worked terrifically to achieve a $29 million increase in product price mix. At retail, we saw meat consumption hold steady in most regions except in Europe as well as the trend of consumers eating more at home and seeking out value cuts of meats.", "Looking ahead, this segment expects comparable week animal production rates in North America in the second quarter which will increase seasonally as we enter the summer barbeque season. We are also expecting ongoing strength in U.S. beef exports to Asia, particularly South Korea and Vietnam. We expect these benefits to be largely offset by ongoing weakness in Europe and in Brazil as both regions are being unfavorably impacted by weak economic conditions and meat demand in Europe. We expect that the net effect will be a low single-digit percent decline in unit volumes for the full year in this segment.", "Looking at our Food Solutions business, we experienced a 5% decline in unit volumes, which included the residual effect of a previously announced change in packaging format by a retailer as well as a significant slowdown in the food service sector. Although the change in packaging format had officially lapsed in the fourth quarter of 2008, one remaining product is still transitioning through April of 2009. Excluding this impact, volumes would have been essentially flat in North America and the segments volume decline would have been 3%.", "The European market contrasted with North America as meat consumption in Europe continued to decline due to economic conditions, resulting in a 10% decline in unit volumes in that region. Our business did see some strength in products associated with the global eat-at-home trend in both North America and in Europe. We saw an uptick in our Pizza packaging solutions and doubled our first quarter sales versus prior year in our new Case-Ready format, Mirabella in Europe.", "Outside of Europe, we achieved a 30% increase in our microwaveable Simple Steps solution in North America.", "Looking ahead, the market had shown signs of stabilization with no new destocking, but also has not shown any real signs of recovery. As such, our Food Solutions team will remain focused on numerous pilot tests that are ongoing with our new Food Solutions worldwide. And we anticipate sales performance excluding the impact of foreign exchange to be relatively flat year-over-year for the full year. We do anticipate some risk in price mix that one might typically see in this kind of environment.", "Protective Packaging was the one area of the business that was most impacted by reduced manufacturing levels and weak retail sales. The business appeared to track at about the same rate since the end of the fourth quarter 2008, suggesting that the market may be close to leveling out. However, we're not seeing any signs of a recovery.", "Overall, volumes declined 22%, primarily in North America and Europe, although we saw declines in volume in our developing regions as well. Manufacturing zones like the Makiladora on along the Mexican-U.S. border and Asian export markets also saw production rates slump in the quarter due to economic conditions.", "To date, our Protective Packaging team has been holding our market position. And one interesting note is that despite the rough and challenging market, we added more new customers in the first quarter in North America than we did in the same quarter in 2008. Part of that reason is the slowdown has given people more opportunity to look at new total cost solutions in which we specialize. And secondly, our sales people are now out calling new customers rather than pursuing price increases as they have done for the last two years.", "Despite the downturn in volumes and a limited number of price concessions, we were successful in maintaining positive price mix in the first quarter.", "Looking ahead, again, we're not expecting a quick recovery in this segment. And our focus will be to continue to bring economically measurable value to our customers to offer them a complete line of solutions and manage price mix.", "And lastly, our other category saw sharp declines in volumes, largely due to a 44% decline in unit volumes of our Specialty Materials business. Like Protective Packaging, Specialty Materials was adversely impacted by a slowdown in manufacturing export activity worldwide. And in addition, our Specialty Materials business does sell to construction, automotive and housing markets. An additional unfavorable impact from these conditions is that the business continued to use Ethafoam inventory that was previously manufactured under our interim supply agreement with Dow; thus, negatively impacting our operating margin in that business.", "At current sales rates, we anticipate working through this inventory by the end of the summer and then we will shift to internally produced products.", "Before I hand the floor over to Dave, I'd like to discuss our full year 2009 earnings guidance.", "Despite lower volumes in our Protective Packaging and Specialty Materials business in the first quarter and our expectations for ongoing weak global conditions through at least the third quarter, we are maintaining our full year 2009 diluted earnings per share of $1.17 to $1.37. This includes a charge of $20 million net of taxes or $0.08 per share expected to be incurred relating to our global manufacturing strategy in 2009. Excluding this charge, the full year 2009 diluted earnings per share guidance continues to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.45.", "It is important to note that we have updated our assumptions to reflect a mid single-digit percent decline in unit volume growth and the benefit of lower operating expenses.", "Our assumptions regarding total year average resin cost, our capital expenditure range, foreign exchange rates and our full year effective tax rate which we outlined in our fourth quarter earnings press release, have not changed. In addition, we remain on track to deliver benefits of $115 million in 2009.", "Despite this quarter's margin rebound to pre-2008 levels, continued progress will be achieved one day at a time. We remain focused on our plan of stringently controlling costs, managing price mix, benefiting from our supply chain initiatives, and we will focus on solid cash flow generation.", "Now I'm going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?", "David H. Kelsey", "Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, our sales were $988 million for the quarter. For those participating in the call who would like additional detail, tables posted on our website, sealedair.com, present the components of the change in net sales by business segment and by geography, the impact of foreign currency translation on sales by geographic regions and the percentage of sales by geographic region.", "As you saw in our financial statements, gross profit was $286 million, a decrease of $19 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Our lower sales volume, particularly as Bill mentioned in the Protective Packaging segment, was the primary contributing factor. Excluding foreign currency translation of $23 million, gross profit would have been $309 million, higher than last year by approximately $4 million.", "Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased $20 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. On a constant dollar basis, operating expenses were $178 million, lower by $8 million or a decrease of 4.5% as compared to the prior year.", "Savings from our cost reduction and productivity program and lower travel expenses both contributed to the year-over-year decrease in spending. Bad debt expense, which gets recorded in this section, was approximately $3 million or $2 million higher than our expense in the first quarter of 2008.", "Operating profit was $120 million or 12.1% of revenue. When we exclude expenses of $3 million related to our global manufacturing strategy as well as restructuring and other charges, operating profit increased to $123 million or 12.4% of revenue.", "On a year-over-year comparison, foreign currency translation had a significant impact on our operating profit. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and the effects of GMS, restructuring and other charges, the operating profit for the first quarter would have been $135 million or 11% higher than the prior year.", "Interest expense decreased $1.5 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The April 2008 retirement of our 5 3/8% note and the December 2008 call of a portion of our 6.95% notes were offset by interest on our new 12% notes, which we borrowed in February this year.", "In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $3 million related to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. We still expect to realize incremental benefit of $20 million in 2009, bringing our cumulative benefits to $45 million, increasing to $55 million in 2010 and thereafter.", "Reviewing our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program, we realized approximately $13 million (ph) of savings in the first quarter. These savings were split between our cost of sales and operating expenses. We still expect annualized savings from this program to be between 50 and $60 million.", "From a cash flow perspective, we made cash payments of approximately $15 million in the first quarter for termination benefits. These cash payments related -- the total cash payments related to this program have been approximately $32 million. The majority of the remaining payments will be made during the balance of this year, less than $5 million falling in 2010.", "I'll conclude with some key balance sheet and cash flow items.", "Our accounts receivable declined $45 million from December 31, 2008. In the quarter, we did not sell any receivables under our accounts receivable securitization facility, retiring the $80 million that we had outstanding at year end. On a constant dollar basis, accounts receivable would have decreased approximately 7% compared to March of last year. We consider ourselves to be well prepared to manage our receivables balances in the current economic climate.", "Our day sales outstanding or DSO were lower at March 31st than at both December 31st and March of last year. Credit and collection is one of many noteworthy efforts in the current economy. We've experienced no appreciable increase in the percent of our receivables that remained uncollected at their contractual due dates.", "Inventory investment at March 31st declined $15 million during the quarter. This decline is attributable to a decrease in inventory held outside the U.S., primarily due to foreign currency translation. Further contributing to the decline since the start of the first quarter has been a successful effort to reduce inventories in our U.S. food segment subsequent to the July 1, 2008 go-live of SAP in those businesses.", "Compared to March 31st of last year, inventory investment was down $94 million or $11 million after adjusting for foreign currency translation. Total borrowings at March 31st were $1.776 billion, up $297 million from the end of December, primarily due to the issuance of our 12% senior notes in February.", "As a reminder, in a few weeks, we'll be using a combination of available cash and short-term committed lines of credit to retire the remaining $137 million of our 6.95% notes when they come due. While capital markets have improve over the course of the first quarter, the environment is not yet stable. Thus, it seems appropriate to comment on Sealed Air's liquidity position.", "First, at March 31st, we had $426 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have access to over $600 million of committed borrowing capacity. Free cash flow, one of our key metrics as a management team, gets close attention. As shown in the supplementary information furnished with our financial statement, free cash flow for the first quarter was $160 million compared to a use of $1 million last year.", "As I've stated previously, our accounts receivable and inventory investment levels were a source of free cash flow during the quarter. Capital investment will be lower in 2009 as work is completed on our three new plants in emerging markets. So we currently expect 2009 capital spending to be in the range of 100 to $125 million. This will return our capital investment to the levels that we made annually in the early part of this decade prior to commencing investments for our global manufacturing strategy. The capital we do invest will be for a combination of maintenance and growth projects.", "Our cash flow projections suggest that we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and the Grace settlement, should it become payable, later this year. However, there is still no date certain for the funding and the settlement and it is conceivable such a funding won't occur this year.", "In the meantime, we will continue to access conditions in the capital markets. Should a date become certain to fund the settlement, we will be prepared. We will also access opportunities to refinance the $431 million of convertible notes that have an initial put date in June of 2010.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William V. Hickey", "Thank you, Dave. Operator, I would now like to open the call up to any questions from the participants.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from George Staphos with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, hi guys, good morning, thanks for the detail. The two questions here. First off, Bill, as we look at the first quarter performance and the guidance for the year, is the simple take that price mix, which you did a very good job on in the quarter, sequentially declined and is offset by the continued ramp and the (ph) operational costs, GMS, restructuring savings? And the second question is are you seeing any intensifying in competition at all, whether it's in Protective Packaging or even in the fresh case in recent weeks or recent quarters? Thanks.", "William Hickey", "Let me come back, let's start with your first question, George, on trend of price mix versus the other cost savings coming through. I think that's a reasonably good way to look at it. Price mix was good in the first quarter. You get the delta as you go through the year because price increases begin to lapse. And obviously, in a competitive market like there is today, you probably can see some of that over the ensuing quarters. But as we say, one of the things, Sealed Air has done extremely well is to manage the downside of the cycle to more than offset the cost on the upside of the cycle. And there is no reason why we are not going to do that again.", "As far as your second question on competitive landscape, there has primarily been a pickup on the Protective side of the business. I think that's because you have a fixed amount of capacity competing for kind of a fewer amount (ph) of demand.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "William Hickey", "And unfortunately, market share has been a primary focus of some of our competitors. However, I am not convinced how sustainable that strategy is in lieu of the debt levels and some of the covenants that a number of our competitors have on the Protective side of the business. So it doesn't change our game plan; it just keeps us sharper on our feet. On the food side, competition has remained relatively steady.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Ingalls & Snyder.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Good morning all.", "William Hickey", "Good morning.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "And congratulations actually for a pretty good quarter given the environment. Is the gross margin improvement at this particular level sustainable and actually better yet? Do you expect sequential improvement even though it is substantially higher than what I expected for the first quarter?", "William Hickey", "Well I think, Rosemarie, if I could tail back that to the... continue the answer I gave to George on the last question is clearly in the first quarter, we had the benefit of the max of the price increases and the trough of the resin costs. So clearly, that's a high number. Now we will manage that as we go through the cycle. And obviously, our price increases will lapse as we go forward. But there is no reason at this point why we shouldn't have -- be able to maintain higher margins in 2009 than we had in 2008 on an overall basis.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "All right. So what you're really saying is that sequentially, we are not necessarily going to see an improvement and we could actually have slightly lower margins because of the dynamics you just talked. Am I reading this properly?", "William Hickey", "Well I wouldn't look for as significant an expansion in margins going forward as you saw in the first quarter.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Okay. And if I could ask my second question, what could be the potential impact from the swine flu as it seems that export curtailment are being talked about by Europe and other countries?", "William Hickey", "Right, right, sure. I figured I could get by the second person without a on -- actually, it's H1N1 flu, because my customers -- our customers in the pork industry do not like the name. They feel that it has not been properly characterized. So I refer to it as H1N1 or North American flu.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "I am writing it down.", "William Hickey", "Yeah, because actually, it is not connected with eating pork or with pork products. And as a result, there is really no reason to ban pork exports or to reduce consumption of pork products.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "It doesn't mean that it's what people are doing, though.", "William Hickey", "Right, right. Then actually some of our customers have seen a drop in the last couple of days. But hopefully, reason will prevail. I believe the U.S. Department of Agriculture has come out clarifying that there is no risk from eating pork or pork products. Right now, the risk is probably contact with other people.", "We have not seen an effect on our business as of now. You are correct in that there have been some reduction in imports. I think Russia has said they are banning -- trade restrictions on pork out of Mexico as well as six states. Most of our U.S. customers feel that they are qualified to export pork. Japan, who is a large global importer of pork, was going to ban imports of pork; but upon reflection of the facts, actually changed its decision. China is reportedly not concerned and has been putting out positive information to consumers. The rest of the export market appears relatively stable. What limitation there have been have been on pork coming out of Mexico and pork coming out of a couple of states in the U.S. And our estimate is that could be up to 3% of our business at this point.", "So, obviously, we're continuing to watch the situation and monitor as it goes along. In fact, we have a call this afternoon after our earnings release to just get an update on the situation, H1N1 around the world.", "In the meantime, we probably will see increases in purchases and shipments and consumption of beef and chicken as those consumers who may incorrectly decide not to purchase or eat pork will likely buy beef or chicken as an alternative.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, thank you.", "William Hickey", "Good morning.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Bill, you made the comment about walking away from some business. Could you just clarify which segment that's in and what the total impact might have been? And then a follow up to that is as you go forward into the second quarter, is that a trend that you're going to continue?", "William Hickey", "Yeah, it's primarily Protective and Specialty which tend to be the parts of our business that are more sensitive to polyethylene pricing. And so some competitors have really very, very quickly moved with the polyethylene price decrease that happened earlier in the quarter in the marketplace. It's a relatively small amount. It's something we've done selectively. You may have heard Dave mention it a year or two ago in Europe where we deliberately made a move to improve the profitability of our European business and probably walked away from 5% of our business in Europe. It's not on that scale in the U.S., but we just felt it was important to let you know that that was part of the volume decline.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "So of that 20% decline in volumes in Protective, it's 1 or 2% at most?", "William Hickey", "A couple of percent. It's a couple of percent.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And is that something that you're going to continue to be doing as you go forward?", "William Hickey", "Well I think we'll look and see what happens in the marketplace. We'll see what happens to -- actually, raw material inputs for those of you that follow, would actually tick up a little bit at the end of first quarter so that we think holding pricing was a reasonable thing to do. And we'll watch what happens to raw materials as we go through the rest of this year. But they're up a little bit from where they started the year at. And obviously, the competitors who jumped the gun are probably feeling a little bit of pain.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Claudia Hueston with JPMorgan.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan Securities", "Thanks very much. Good morning. It was a strong cash flow quarter for you and it sounds like inventories were a big help there. Can you just talk about how you expect working capital to trend over the remainder of the year and how you expect your productivity initiatives to contribute to cash flow? And then maybe just comment on your priorities for cash.", "William Hickey", "Okay, let me pass it over to Dave Kelsey.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan Securities", "Thank you.", "David Kelsey", "Clearly, the first quarter was exceptional. We not only got good cash flow from operations, but, in part due to the seasonal decline in sales we see in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter last year and the slowdown the economy, we had much less invested in working capital. As we move through the year, I wouldn't expect to see any significant change in the cash coming from operating activities. And certainly, we expect to track to that 100 million to $125 million spending for capital items.", "In terms of working capital, I think a lot of the improvement is behind us in accounts receivable. I do think going forward, there will be some improvement in inventories, but nothing on the scale of what we saw in the first quarter. So I wouldn't expect to see any $160 million quarters of free cash flow for the balance of the year.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan Securities", "Okay. And then just priorities for cash?", "David Kelsey", "Well, as I think you know, our operating activities tend to be self sustaining. Every quarter of the year, we do generate positive cash flow from operations. So there is other than some timing issues, if we have to make a large interest payment or the 137 million in debt that we'll be retiring in May, we don't tend to need to go into our working capital facilities to borrow. So that leaves as the big priority for the balance of the year the Grace settlement. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is no assurance that that settlement is going to occur this year. But if it were to occur, we have adequate funds at our disposal to do the settlement.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Bill, I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about that volume decline in Protective Packaging. It was even a bit bigger than I expected. Was it a surprise to you that it's off quite that much?", "William Hickey", "Well, as I say, in my prepared comments, I said the volume drop-off actually exceeded our expectations from earlier in the year. But Mark, it's interesting, and I know you asked Amanda about comparing the shipments of corrugated boxes.", "But a couple of things that I should point out. One is the corrugated shipments in March are actually down 16%. Global air freight is down 20%. U.S. rail ex-coal is down kind of mid-20s. Interesting, Sealed Air there has built its business around the world. Let's not forget that half our business is outside the U.S. And in some of the developing parts of the world, particularly the export-oriented economies in Asia, we saw numbers drop 25, 30%. And if you really look at us as a better measure of industrial activity on a global basis, I'll really point to 3M, which released earnings a couple of days ago. And I believe in their press release, they reported their global volumes were down around 19.5 %.", "So I think that's kind of a better surrogate for the Sealed Air 2009 that really has got a global footprint with half our business in others parts of the world and increasing components of our business outside of the core U.S. corrugated box business. So I hope that helps you understand it, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "That's very good. And if I could just as a follow on, Bill, in the two food businesses that you're in, you've mentioned you had seen a slowdown in meat consumption over in Europe. Are you seeing any other kind of changes in consumption patterns in either the developed markets or maybe in the emerging markets like China with the slowdown in the economy?", "William Hickey", "Well, in Brazil, we've seen a little bit of contraction in domestic demand in Brazil. And we've also seen a movement to kind of cheaper cuts in the same animal. Actually, ground beef is doing obviously, in this economy, ground beef is doing a lot better than T-bone steaks. So that we're seeing across the world.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. But no slowdown in terms of China perhaps?", "William Hickey", "No, actually -- now, China has reduced its imports of pork, but that's primarily because their herd is recovering. If you recall, they had that blue ear epidemic a year, year and a half ago, and they actually were importers of pork. But they're building their herd back up, so their pork imports are actually down. No dramatic change in consumption, but probably not as quick a growth in this economy either.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Good morning.", "William Hickey", "Good morning.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Just wanted to clarify, coming back to Protective Packaging. I believe you said down 22%, but leveling out, but not necessarily an upturn. And yet, I think you said you thought the inventory destocking was over. So I was just hoping you could clarify, if the inventory destocking was over, I would think that you'd have a noticeable upturn in your volumes.", "William Hickey", "Well let me go back and say the actual down number is down 20%.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "20%.", "William Hickey", "Down 20. And I'd like to say it this way is that the customer behavior seemed to be kind of bouncing along the bottom. There is no incentive to rebuild inventory because manufacturing output is down. And everyone is sort of holding on, waiting for it to recover before they turn on the next machine. It's interesting. We did a look at our top 50 customers in our Protective business. And we didn't lose a single account in those top 50 customers, but all of them were down in the 20, 20 plus percent range depending on the company, the industry they were in and the part of the country they are in. And we really don't see that turning on the machine and manufacturing their product and then calling us for the packaging. We've got three to five day lead times, so we're pretty close to what actually happens. And they are running on a substantially lower inventory level than they had before.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And just to elaborate, Bill, if I could. So if we're expecting flattish demand going forward at this depressed level, presumably, that means we should, knowing what we know today, continue to see those kinds of year-over-year declines, is that fair?", "William Hickey", "Actually, it will lapse again. Obviously, you get to the point where third quarter where it began to go down last year, you will see that decline lapse. I mean you will see it lesser. And then obviously, by the time you get to the fourth quarter, assuming it hasn't recovered, you will see it flat, slightly up. But I am still a green sprout person that somewhere along the line people are going to run out of things and they are going to have to go out and buy them. And they will turn on that machine and the orders will come in, just in --", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much, Bill.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital", "Good morning. A question on the cost savings. I may have missed it, but the 13 million, does that include the restructuring plus the GMS and do you expect this to just layer in linearly throughout the year?", "William Hickey", "Dave?", "David Kelsey", "Yeah, the 13 million from the cost program which was the major head count reduction initiative that we've launched last summer is expected to be in the range of 50 to $60 million for the year, so $13 million is a pretty good run rate, we did have some employees who didn't apart until the first quarter this year, so that number should pick-up marginally, but there are also decent back, so as some critical positions get restart. So, I don't think a big change from that current run rate. And just to clear, I'd like to emphasize that those savings occur in both cost of sold and in our marketing administrative and development expenses. So you need to think about that is on the order of 50:50, 60:40 split in savings.", "Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. And to clarify on the GMS savings, is there how much do you think could be at risk of the 20 million if volumes don't start to recover?", "David Kelsey", "Well, right now, we're not backing off of that expected level, and we make a point of referring to those as benefits as opposed to savings because we are loading up these new facilities at some of our lowest cost facilities globally. And so that's still our guidance, Al, is for $20 million of incremental benefit out of the global manufacturing strategy.", "Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. And then second question, big picture, Bill, clearly, focused on cost controls through the challenging economic environment. What are some of the things you're doing now to position yourself for next year to hopefully take advantage as volumes recover?", "William Hickey", "Well I think, Al, a couple of key points is one, we're continuing to invest in R&D. I mean we still have an active pipeline of new product development. We actually have a couple a new products coming out in the second quarter. We actually are as you heard me say in my prepared comments calling our new customers. One of the phenomena which I've seen in our earlier downturns which I really leave is going to occur this time is, as I've said, we saw our top 50 customers, their volumes fall off. We think, we are also seeing that our sales people have called on more new customers in the first quarter of '09 than in '08. So what actually happens is when economy begins to turn upward, we get those existing 50 customers start to come back to more normal levels and you get the benefits of the new customers we have been able to pickup during this period of slowdown.", "And you get kind of a double whammy effect on the upside. And we're doing everything we can to be well prepared for that. We're continuing with our GMS program and completing the capacity additions that we planned a couple of years ago. We're continuing our R&D pipeline and we're continuing our new product introductions and I think those are the right things to do for both the short-term and the long-term, so that when the economy recovers, we will be positioned to benefit.", "Al Kabili - Macquarie Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Fritz von Carp with Sage Asset Management.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah, I was wondering, I just wanted to go back to the general topic of inventory destocking. And I thought you might have some insight in your Protective business as to where various sectors are in terms of their own inventory destocking process, closer to beginning or closer to the end. Can you give me any color?", "William Hickey", "We sell to about 400 different SIC codes, and I'm not sure I can tell you particularly which ones are doing better or worse. I mean clearly, automotive and construction, anything relates to that side are really off the edge of the chart, so to speak. We've seen a lot of sort of the pumps and valves people. They are sort of kind of bottoming or bottomed, things like aircraft and aerospace excluding automotive -- transportation, excluding automotive are probably pretty well bottomed out as far as we see unless there is another leg. I mean it's a question whether this is a W or a U. I talked to someone the other day who thought it was a W. But I'm not in the W camp in terms of the recession. So overall, that's about as much color I can provide.", "On segments, geographically, I think Europe is in a deeper trough than the U.S. You heard me say in Latin America, excluding Brazil, our business was actually up kind of double digits. Business economies, segments are pretty well in kind of Russia and in Asia. And I know despite some of the concerns expressed in kind of the media about Eastern Europe and the financial institutions in Eastern Europe, you heard me say our business in Poland is particularly up kind of double digits. So that's really about as much color as I can provide at this level.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Burns with Cranial Capital.", "Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital", "Bill, David, Amanda, how are you?", "William Hickey", "Good, Tim. Good morning Tim.", "David Kelsey", "Good morning.", "Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital", "Good morning. When we think Food Packaging, I think a lot of people think of big carcasses or volumes of chicken traveling around the world. But are you benefiting at all from I guess more economic alternatives such as quick serve restaurants, meals ready to eat where you might be selling for instance some of your aseptic bags or your polypropylene trays and lids?", "William Hickey", "Tim, I think you are right. Our business -- I mean one of the reasons why we separate out the Food Solutions business from the core Food Packaging business was to focus on sort of the value added down stream components of Food Packaging and we're seeing that. But you've got to realize too, people are eating out less. So a lot of the pickup we saw in the last year or two are actually quite soft. In fact, they're down in mid single digits.", "But you heard we say in my prepared comments in the heat and eat category or the home meal replacement, or however you want to call it, the convenience food, our Simple Steps microwavable offering is up about 30%, which is an indication of people eating at home, yet don't want to go through the cooking process.", "So you can bring in simple entr\u00e9e and they are priced in the 3.99 to 4.99, $5 category, and you can get a meal for three or four people in terms of the center of the plate. And that's had good volume. So I think as we watch this, the mid, the upper price out dinning out is probably down a lot, the low cost that you've seen in the McDonalds numbers and some other fast food, they are holding up reasonably well and doing well. And then they eat at home component whether it's ground beef, where we're seeing positive growth or the take home many.", "So I think your hypothesis is correct. They still are relatively a small part of our business, but it's one over the longer term as consumers focus more on convenience and eases their beatings that long term, we think it's a right place to be.", "Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital", "Sounds like my voice cooking, but the other question I had was, when you guys have these unfortunate, I don't want to call it catastrophes, but just shifting in the consumption of protein due to whatever, blue ear, N1H1, do you find that your skill set in moving around production has improved because of that? And is there less loss of profit as a result?", "William Hickey", "Tim, that's a excellent point. I mean, you said something that I have been thinking about, and maybe this gives me an opportunity to say it is that the footprint we have around the world and the capability our people have and the skill sets we have particularly with the new additions in China and Poland and Hungary and Brazil and the rest of the world. We have really got to develop a very flexible organization that can move on a dime. Our dime is pretty quick, but we can move reasonably quickly for the size organization to build on changes and pork not going to Mexico and going into China and chicken not going to Russia, coming out of Brazil. We manage that I think pretty. And I think that's a capability that I don't think anyone else in our space has.", "And I'll give you a little example because it gives me an opportunity. In Latin America, in Mexico with the H1N1 issue, I mean our Latin American group, our management in Mexico immediately jumped on the case. We've instituted extra hygiene procedures in our plan, the employees are washing their hands every hour, or you were sanitizing our equipment much more frequently. People are wearing face masks. I mean the way in which we've gotten accustomed to dealing with these changing catastrophes, the organization responds and responds well. And I really want to compliment our organization in Latin America and Mexico for responding as quickly as they have to what's happening in Mexico. And I think that's a capability that we've developed. I guess the hard way, Tim, going through a couple of these crises over the last 10 years.", "Timothy Burns - Cranial Capital", "Got you. Go Paz (ph). Thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we have a follow-up question from George Staphos with Banc of America Securities.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Hey Bill. Bill, when volumes were down as much they are in Protective Packaging for understandable reasons, I guess it doesn't matter that much product by product. But I was curious if you think about the various subcategories within Protective, how have they been trending? Are you seeing Instapak holding up better or is it getting worse? What are you seeing in terms of inflatables and Bubble Wrap and that sort of thing to the overall average?", "William Hickey", "Yeah, I was just actually was looking at those numbers just before the call George. And probably, the Instapak business has been the one that's been sort of hurt the most. And that tends to protect the high end, high value shipments, heavily manufactured goods. And then Bubble Wrap a little bit less down than that. Actually, mailers are actually up a little bit; the mailers as replacements for corrugated boxes in terms of relatively compared to the rest of the business. And foam, the thin foams are pretty much down quite a bit, little around the Instapak range. And the thick foams, the plank, like the Ethafoam business, which goes a lot into computer packaging, construction insulation, and that's down in the 30% range.", "So there is a mix in that range going from down single-digits to down in the 30% range. And that 20 as you said is a composite number of them all. And obviously, each of our products serve a different segment, serve a different application, serve a different kind of channel. And so what you are seeing here is the total and the range is probably 10% either way.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, but just given some of the things that you mentioned there before, it amplifies the benefits you got both from mix and also from productivity, cost reduction when you look at the mix with some of those product lines.", "William Hickey", "Okay.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "The other question I had is within Food Packaging, can you remind us again what product lines do you have now that are best situated to the consumer who is trying to get a meal from the supermarket, or meal replacement as opposed to eating out or preparing at home for that matter as well?", "William Hickey", "Yeah, that's primarily in the Food Solutions business and it's primarily the Simple Steps, which is the ready-to-heat meat. It's a vacuum skin entr\u00e9e under a tray sold under a number of brands in the supermarket in the refrigerated component of the store.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "But for a retailer who is offering a product to the consumer to take home, what product lines we could be offering there?", "William Hickey", "I'm not sure -- you mean the put it in the microwave and heat meat, George, is that what --", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Exactly, exactly.", "William Hickey", "Yeah, that would be the Simple Steps. That would be the Simple Steps.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks. I'll turn it over.", "William Hickey", "Okay, operator, we are running out of time. I do want a make a comment is that due to technical issues, we are not seeing any text questions which are sent in over the Internet. So if you have sent any questions in over the Internet, our vendor has logged all of those in and we'll be able to answer your questions offline or on our May 4th meeting which will be webcast. So I apologize that we have not been able to pickup questions that have been submitted over the Internet. You know, I always try to pick those up along the way. So please log those questions in offline.", "I do want to thank you all for participating in the call today. I would also like to thank all of our employees around the world who have really worked hard in the first quarter and made a lot of personal sacrifices to control expenses, at the same time continuing to offer our customers exceptional service.", "As a team, we are staying focused on improving our operating profit and cash flow from operations from the continued benefits of our productivity programs, our supply chain initiatives and our management of price mix. Even in challenging times, we are really excited about our future. We know our efforts will ultimately result in a more efficient and more agile organization. And we will be well positioned to accelerate sustainable growth to the organization once economic conditions improve. Thank you all again for taking the time to listen to us today.

Kelsey - Sr. VP, CFO", "Analysts", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Operator", "Good morning everyone and welcome to the Sealed Air Conference Call discussing Sealed Air's fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, we will have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice president and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator instructions] We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question per caller so that others will have a chance to ask their questions.", "And now at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. Our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We have also posted supplemental financial information and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we expect to discuss on our website at sealedair.com in the investor relations information section under Filings.", "Now I'll turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Amanda. Good morning everyone. I am Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today, in addition to Amanda, we have Dave Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer. As an introduction I will provide a few highlights of our business for the fourth quarter and full-year 2007. Dave will then review select details of our financial results. After Dave's remarks, we will then have time to take all of your questions.", "We are pleased that we finished the year with steady sales, volume and earnings growth that met the guidance we originally provided to you back in January of 2007. All during an increasingly challenging year with increasing raw material and energy cost rising to new highs. In 2007, we continued to focus and execute on our growth plans for new product development and geographic expansion.", "Our successes in 2007 include the launch of over 20 new products including two new products based on renewable materials. We also expanded our presence in medical applications and specialty materials, two areas where we see high growth in the future.", "Looking at our operational initiatives. We finished the year with the completion of our flexible film lines in Shanghai, China, which are now running commercial products for the Chinese market. We completed the SAP integration in all regions of our company outside of North America, and we centralized our North American customer service center in South Carolina, and at the same time we maintain the efficiency in which we use our raw materials, which added over $30 million to our bottom line during 2007.", "Looking at our sales results, fourth quarter sales increased 9% setting another record of $1.3 billion. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, our sales growth was largely driven by volume growth in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific primarily in our food business. Our full year sales increased 7% to $4.7 billion compared with $4.3 billion in 2006.", "Again, excluding a favorable effect of foreign currency translation, sales growth was largely attributed to the volume growth in our food businesses in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific. This growth led to a milestone for us in Asia Pacific, with that region reaching over $600 million in sales during 2007. Additionally our Latin American business grew by 11% in the year with its sales surpassing the $400 million mark in 2007.", "During the year, we also saw continued strong double-digit growth of 22% in developing countries of the world such as China and Russia and accelerating growth rates in smaller Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic and Romania. Our success in these regions is attributable to the strength of our brands, our product portfolio, our strong geographic presence, our people on the ground and continued economic development for both domestic consumption and for export.", "In the fourth quarter, our diluted earnings per share were $0.45, excluding the special items mentioned in our press release earlier this year. For the full year, our diluted earnings per share were $1.65 excluding the charges mentioned earlier which was 8% increase over 2006. We accomplished this earnings growth while absorbing rising raw material cost for the full year about $19 million higher than the full year 2006 on an equivalent volume basis.", "Taking a closer look at our reportable segments and the other category, our food packaging business again showed solid performance in the fourth quarter as we continued to gain new business with net sales growing at 10% or if you exclude a favorable effect of foreign currency at 4%. Volumes were solid in the quarter with 4% growth rate, which outpaced slaughter rates from those beef categories. Our business growth reflected strong demand from our roll stock and vacuum shrink bags in the Americas as well as favorable price mix in North America.", "During the quarter, we announced a number of price increases across various regions that targeted rising raw material cost, but which will largely impact 2008 results. Additionally we launched several new products, including Marinade on Demand, Grip and Tear bags, and Freshness Plus, which serve both the food service and consumer applications.", "Looking at our full-year 2007 results, Food Packaging net sales grew 8% or 4% if you exclude the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. We experienced strong volume growth in Latin America, North America, and Asia-Pacific and strong product price mix in North America and Europe during the year. Looking ahead, we feel that the continued strength in the global red meat slaughter rate and protein demand, as well as innovative product development focused on source reduction and continued expansion of our new products into international markets will support growth in 2008. We estimate that the Food Packaging segment's core business net sales, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, should grow in the range of 4% to 6% on an annual basis over the next few years. We also are expecting ongoing margin improvement in this category with the launch of new manufacturing facilities in 2008 and the creation of centers of excellence on our North American and European manufacturing platforms.", "Moving on to our higher growth food segment, Food Solutions, we increased our net sales growth rate to 16% in the fourth quarter or 8% excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Unit volume growth increased to 6% with our largest unit volume growth in Europe and North America. Additionally, we experienced solid increases in price mix in Europe and in Asia-Pacific. During the quarter, we also announced price increases across various regions that targeted rising raw material costs. As I said previously, these will largely impact 2008 results.", "For the full year, Food Solutions' net sales grew at 12% or again excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency at 7%. We experienced solid growth across all regions, but most growth was attributable to North America and Europe. Product price mix growth was also solid in North America and Europe, due to a favorable mix of pads and trays in North America and ready meal and vertical pouch packaging flexible films in Europe. Case-Ready and Vertical Pouch Packaging continue to grow at double-digit rates during the year. Case-Ready continued to expand its leadership position and grew at 12% in 2007. We also launched Mirabella, a new low-profile format, which partially contributed to full-year Case-Ready sales that exceeded $450 million. Vertical Pouch Packaging also had a strong year, with 16% growth and record global equipment placements and a four-fold increase in sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Vertical Pouch Packaging sales are now over $125 million per year. Our ready meal solutions continued to expand with pizza, microwavable solutions for frozen foods and new tray solutions driving increased adoption throughout the year.", "Looking ahead into 2008, we will continue to expand our presence in Case-Ready, Ready Meals and in various foods\u2026 servers applications with widening our customer and application base, in vertical pouch packaging, in order to further our market presence with our new aseptic and retort applications. As consumers may opt to dine in more in 2008, we feel that trend to be favorable to our food business and many of our newest product launches, such as Pizza Fresh and Mirabella. We estimate that the Food Solutions segment core business net sales, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions will grow in the range of 10% to 15%, on an annual basis in the next few years. This is a business we are investing in, but we are also expecting ongoing margin improvement during the same time period. I'd also like to remind you on our food solutions business, particularly Case-Ready that most of our trades are outsourced products, and we are in an average 17% profit margin but with little or no capital invested in. You must consider that a factor in looking at our operating performance on food solutions.", "Moving on to protective packaging, fourth quarter net sales increased 2% excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the unfavorable impact from the sale of a small product line, fourth quarter sales decreased slightly by 1%. Despite volume growth being slightly down in the quarter due to the challenging conditions in North America's most end markets, we did experience 6% volume increases in both Asia Pacific and Latin America with increasing sales of inflatables, shrink films and Instapak in Asia Pacific, and shrink films and air cellular products in Latin America.", "During the quarter we also announced price increases in this segment that targeted rising raw material cost, but again which will largely impact our 2008 results. For the full year, protective packaging net sales grew by 2% excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange translation and the unfavorable impact from the sale of smaller more product line, protective packaging sales were even with 2006. Volumes experienced a very slight decline overall, keeping our performance ahead of common proxys such as corrugated box shipments which declined approximately 2% and we are aided by our 2% volume growth in our International regions. We experienced 9% volume growth in Asia Pacific, and 7% volume growth in Latin America in protective packaging high riding the benefits of our diversified footprint and our global sales mix. From prior perspective, we saw success in our recent Pack-Tiger acquisitions having placed over 300 systems, and the adoption of new products such as NewAir, Instapak quick and its Room Temperature version.", "Looking ahead we anticipate comparable slow growth rates in our North American pack protective packaging business in 2008. However, we expect continued growth in our international markets. We estimate that protective packaging's core business net sales excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions will grow in the range of 3% to 5% on an annual basis in the next few years, and we are expecting to maintain or even improve margins during this period. Lastly, our other category increased net sales by 23% or 15% excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation during the fourth quarter, with all regions experiencing double-digit growth rates. The primary growth driver in the fourth quarter were the acquisitions of Alga Plastics in medical applications in August and the acquisition of certain assets relating to Dow's ETHAFOAM and related polyethylene foam product lines in November.", "Despite continued adoption in testing and the launch of new products, particularly in insulation solution in Scandinavia, volumes appeared weak in the quarter largely due to an unfavorable year-over-year volume comparison and our medical applications business resulting from an aggressive 2006 fourth quarter customer purchases in Europe, there we made an anticipation of our SAP conversion in Europe at the end of last year.", "For the full year, other category net sales increased by 18% or 12%, excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Both our special materials and medical businesses had double-digit growth rates for the year, with medical sales increasing by over 20% excluding foreign exchange. Similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter, growth was largely due to acquisitions. But we also had a 5% volume growth in the year, led primarily by 12% volume growth in our international regions in both our specialty materials and medical businesses.", "Looking ahead, we will continue to expand our presence in medical applications and we will be focused on the successful commercialization of new technologies and product lines that exist in our specialty materials business. We estimate that the other category core business net sales excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions will grow in the range of 15% to 20% on an annual basis in the next few years. And to our Food Solutions, we're also investing in these new businesses. But we're expecting to improve margins during this period.", "Before I hand it over to Dave, I'd like to touch upon 2008 and our guidance. Looking ahead, we are continuing to focus and execute for growth and global diversification in our business. This includes our ongoing investment for growth in the BRIC regions of the world including capacity expansions in countries like Malaysia.", "Our continued work to establish new manufacturing sites at Eastern Europe and Mexico as part of our global manufacturing strategy. We will be continuing our investments in product development and product launches which you will see as soon as the first quarter as well as continuing our focus on renewable packaging solutions. We will continue the expansion of our applications in the adjacent segments using new and existing technologies, both through partnerships and with acquisitions. We will enhance the global promotion of our solutions with the completion of platform product showcase centers in China and the United States.", "We will complete our global SAP rollout with the final phase in North America later this year. And finally, we remain focused on optimizing our operations reducing our costs, enhancing our flexibility and beginning supply chain initiatives that are focused on inventory reduction and optimizing our procurement practices.", "During the year, we will be monitoring raw material prices and we will make appropriate price adjustments as necessary to continue to manage our profitability. We expect our full year 2008 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74 on a generally accepted accounting principle basis, which includes charges of $21 million or $0.11 a share expected to be incurred with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. Excluding these charges, we expect our 2008 earnings to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share.", "Our guidance assumes full year average raw material cost will increase slightly over 2007. Used volume growth in 2008 will be comparable to what we saw in 2007 which we feel is consistent with our expectations for moderate growth in the global economy. We are also assuming a full-year effective tax rate of 31% and operating expenses of approximately 16% of net sales. So, I am expecting 2008 to be another year of growth diversification, but most of all execution for Sealed Air.", "Now I am going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance. Dave?", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you Bill.", "As Bill mentioned, our sales were a record $1.250 billion for the quarter. More than 85% of our $105 million of revenue growth or $89 million came from our international operations. International volume grew $70 million or 2.8% and favorable foreign currency translation contributed $66 million.", "For the quarter, approximately 54% of our revenue came from outside the United States. For those participating in the call, who would like additional detail tables posted on our website Sealedair.com present the percentage of sales by geographic region, the components of the change in net sales by business segment and by geography, and the impact of foreign currency translation on sales by geographic region.", "Moving to our statement of operations, the company's gross profit was a record $344 million for the fourth quarter compared with $339 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Food Solutions gross profit grew $7 million and Food Packaging gross profit grew $3 million. Strong sales volume growth and price mix gains in both food segments more than offset higher resin prices.", "Protected packaging gross profit declined $5 million and the other category declined $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Both of these segments experienced lower unit volumes before factoring in the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. And they both had an unfavorable combination of price and mix.", "Without the topline support, Protective Packaging and the Other category were unable to offset higher resin costs in the quarter. Moreover, our specialty films  product line in North America included in the Other category experienced some of our most pronounced resin increases as a percent of revenues. The total company, resin costs in the quarter were $19 million higher compared to the prices paid for resins in the fourth quarter of 2006. The selling price increases that we announced in the fourth quarter lagged our increased cost for resins and thus the benefits will not be realized until the first and second quarters of 2008. Cost related to our global manufacturing strategy did not have a meaningful impact on our fourth quarter gross profit comparison to 2006. Marketing, administrative and development expenses were $198 million compared to $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. As a percent of revenue, these overhead expenses declined to 15.8% compared with 16.3% for the fourth quarter of 2006. Foreign currency translation contributed $9 million of the $11 million dollar year-over-year increase.", "These expenses included $4 million related to acquired businesses, $3 million of additional expense to support the opening of our new state-of-the-art customer service center in North America, and $7 million related to new product development activities. Excluding this $14 million of spending to support our growth initiatives and the $9 million impact of foreign exchange, marketing, administrative and development expenses would have been $175 million. Operating profit was $145 million for the fourth quarter, an improvement of $11 million from the third quarter, despite the absorption of $7 million of sequentially higher resin cost.", "Operating profit as a percentage of sales was 11.6%, essentially unchanged from the second and third quarter margins, and down compared to 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Both the Food Packaging and Food Solutions segments reported modest year-over-year increases in operating profit. Protective Packaging operating profit was $7 million below 2006 due to the sales and resin factors that also impacted gross profit. The other category, which includes specialty materials, medical applications and our investments in new ventures, reported a year-over-year decline of $2 million of operating profit during the fourth quarter. This decline was attributed to a decline in North American sales volumes before including acquisitions and the more pronounced impact of resin cost on our specialty foams business.", "Interest expense was $35 million, essentially unchanged from 2006. Other income for the quarter was $8 million, a decrease of $13 million compared to last year. The company expensed $8 million in the quarter for services performed by third parties on a transaction for which work has now ceased. Interest income was $5 million this year compared to $4 million in last year's fourth quarter. Income tax expense for the quarter was $23 million and resulted in an effective income tax rate of 22.7%. The low tax rate for the quarter was primarily the result of the reversal of tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions. For 2008, our guidance is that our core income tax rate should be 31%, as we expect a further reduction of our effective blended rate for state taxes.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $0.43 for the quarter compared to $0.45 in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the full year were $1.89 compared to $1.47 in 2006, a 29% increase. Excluding these items detailed in our supplemental information available on our website sealedair.com, diluted earnings per common share for 2007 were $1.65 compared to $1.53 for 2006, an increase of 8%. As stated in today's earnings press release, this EPS was consistent with the low end of the EPS guidance range we provided in our earnings press release in January of last year.", "I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Our combined balance of cash and short-term investments at December 31st was $471 million, an increase of $52 million from the beginning of the quarter. Some noteworthy sources and uses of cash during the quarter were EBITDA of $181 million, reduced inventory of $22 million, capital expenditures of $53 million, and a dividend payment of $16.2 million. Our quarter-end accounts receivable totaled $794 million, up a nominal $2 million from September 30th. Compared to December of last year, receivables investment increased to $73 million or 10% while our quarter-over-quarter sales increased to $105 million or 9%.", "Customer receivables balances outside North America were up double-digits, with foreign currency translation contributing $34 million or 47% of this year-over-year increase. This increase also reflects our growth internationally and the generally longer payment cycles in these markets. Also representative of our international business, VAT receivables were up $9 million year-over-year. Inventory investment at December 31st was $582 million, down $22 million during the quarter. This lower investment is attributed to our supply chain initiative to improve our cash-to-cash cycle time and to reduce our logistics costs. Compared to December 31st of last year, inventory investment was up $72 million or 14%.", "Inventories in the US were up only $3 million year-over-year. The increased investment in inventories outside the US was attributable to $24 million of foreign currency translation and to $45 million primarily to support our sales growth internationally. Total borrowings at the end of December were $1.872 billion, essentially unchanged during the quarter. The outstanding balance of $300 million related to a debt issue that matures in April 2008 is reported in current liabilities. Our cash position and our available committed borrowing capacity is more than sufficient to retire these notes when they mature.", "Capital expenditures were $53 million for the quarter. Of this spending, $13 million was incurred on projects undertaken as part of our global manufacturing strategy. Our capital investments exceeded our guidance for the full-year 2007 of $200 million, primarily to support capacity additions that were independent of our global manufacturing strategy projects. For the total year, we invested $59 million to towards the completion of the first phase of our global manufacturing strategy. Looking ahead, our guidance is for 2008 capital spending to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million. This outlook includes $70 million necessary to complete the first phase of our global manufacturing strategy.", "In concluding my comments on our financial performance, I'd like to summarize the status of our global manufacturing strategy. The $59 million capital investment in 2007 brings our cumulative capital investment for 2006 and 2007 to $73 million. The additional investment plan for 2008 of $70 million will bring our total capital investment to $143 million. This will essentially complete the first phase of our global manufacturing strategy within our expected range of $130 million to $150 million. We have already begun limited production at our Greenfield plant in China and our new location in Mexico.", "By this time next year, we expect to be producing at our new site in Eastern Europe. In addition to our capital investment, we had previously estimated that other costs associated with expanding our global manufacturing base and establishing centers of excellence would total $90 million to $100 million. These expenses would be charged to our P&L over the period from 2006 to 2008.", "In 2007, we expensed $12 million significantly below our original guidance of $35 million. In 2006, we incurred expenses of $16 million, so that our cumulative spending through 2007 has been $28 million. During 2008, we currently expect to expend an additional $30 million. The actual timing of these remaining expenses is subject to change due to a variety of factors that could cause a portion of these charges to occur in 2009. This remaining $30 million for other costs would bring our total for these expenses to $58 million, well below our original range of $90 million to $100 million.", "In summary, we currently are estimating that our combined capital investment and related expenses will approximate $200 million, where 85% of the amount we envisioned when we announce these global capacity additions in 2006. We are projecting our benefits to come down proportionately with these lower costs. Also, due to delays in starting construction of the facility in Eastern Europe, we expect a commencement delay in the timing of the savings from this particular facility. Thus our current estimate is for a benefit of approximately $45 million in 2009, increasing to $55 million in 2010.", "And now, I will turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much Dave. Operator, I would now like to open up the call to questions from participants.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "First question operator.", "Operator", "Ghansham Panjabi with Wachovia.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia", "Hi guys, good morning.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia", "Given all the resin price increases that are currently out there and they were implemented in the fourth quarter and given your own selling price increases that you spoke about, is it fair to assume that you might be behind in the price [inaudible] in the first quarter and maybe catch up quickly second quarter onwards? How should we think about it?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think that's a fair statement. I mean the price increases were announced and it is interesting the outlook we have for resin in 2008, kind of a flip of what it was in 2007. Remember 2007 started low and proceeded to decline, really peaking in the fourth quarter, actually with the December price increases. Given our price increase, our price announcements in late November or early December, getting those all through the system, we probably have more resin at higher cost and we have selling price increases actually in effect. So\u2026 and I think you have heard some of our peers in the space stay pretty much the same thing.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia", "So, in your full-year guidance, Bill are you assuming that resin declines in the second half of the year or just flat with maybe 1Q levels?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "If you looked at my comments, my comments say we expect we would be slightly higher in 2008 than in 2007, but to come off a little bit from where we are right now to have been in the first month of the year.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia", "Okay, and just lastly on, can you just update us on what you think of in terms of share buy backs?  You obviously generated a fair amount of cash in '07, probably in '08 as well. And certainly in '09 as your CapEx comes down, so you have a big authorization out there for share repurchases. Can you just update us on your thoughts there?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I just think the stocks are very attractive at the current price. I don't think I can say any more than that.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia", "Okay, good enough. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from Robert [inaudible] with Goldman Sachs.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning guys. Just wanted to talk a little bit about resin again. I know, if you could just perhaps clarify Bill. I know you said you expect overall a slight increase, but if I look at where the CMAI is for just like a benchmark polyethylene grade, on average right now, they are assuming that 2008 polyethylene is up like low double digit relative to 2007. So, I know that, that's just one of 15 resins that you buy, but I am wondering if you are taking a more aggressive view of a drop in resins than they [inaudible].", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we pretty much follow, we follow CMAI, we follow a couple of different people and again polyethylene is one of 15 and is perhaps the most common and has had the most dramatic change in price, but it is\u2026 I am trying to remember the numbers, sort of 48%, less than 50% of our total resin purchases. We are probably of the view that the second half for the year polyethylene will be ... will flatten out.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, okay. What's your view on the, on the current increase for polyethylene? Do you think [inaudible] for renegotiation?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, just one comment on current quarter, but most of the increases in the fourth quarter actually happened.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, okay and then, I guess the last part of the resin question is with all the increase you saw in\u2026 I guess in PE in 2007, when you announced the price hike at the end of the year, how much of the increase were inflation in 2007 you were trying to recover? When would have been the last time that you raised price?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "We raised prices earlier in 2007. I don\u2019t remember the exact date.", "Amanda Butler - Director of Investor Relations", "That was in range of September.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, in September, in September we also had certain product lines got an increase in September, that was from Amanda. Yeah. So, we have an increase in September in certain products and then it followed up in December on other products as well as some of the polyethylene-based products that also had an increase in September.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, okay. So, the current increase like the latest one announced just covers basically like the last three months or so of the year?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. Our view is that we've essentially with the announced increases have covered the announced resin increases at this time.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, okay. Okay, a separate topic on the Global Manufacturing Strategies since the timing of the cost savings was pushed out a little bit. Is that just fully related as I think you alluded to delays in construction, or is there any read across maybe market, there is not enough demand or you don't see much growth in those markets?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I will ask David to comment on it, but I will tell you I wish I could get the plant sooner, we are sold out in a couple of products and we really need a plant. But Dave, why don\u2019t you finish off there.", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, if you take the savings that we are now projecting in 2009 of $45 million as a ratio to the $200 million that we are going to be spending between capital and other cost, that is right in line with the earlier numbers of $250 million of spending and $55 million to $60 million of savings. So, it's really been a fine tuning over the three-year course of implementing this phase of the strategy and the\u2026 we still even though we are spending less money expect to get to the low end of that 55 to 65 range in 2010 and that is... that delay is attributable to the issues we had mentioned previously in Central Europe. The ability to take possession of the real estate was delayed as we negotiated for various benefits. And that's all taken care of, ground has been broken, construction is underway. So, we are on track on a going-forward basis.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And just final topic on that. The only reasons that the expense is related to that strategy are coming in a little bit lower cost, basically?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I would say it's more of the real world has overtaken our upfront estimates.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "We do try to be appropriately conservative, particularly on a project of this magnitude when we introduced it back in 2006.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, all right, thanks very much guys.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Next question operator?", "Operator", "Next question will come from Claudia Hueston with JP Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, thanks very much. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the other segment. I guess I'm still sort of adjusting to the reportings filed here. And the margins in the segment have sort of jumped around a lot. And I just wondered if you could help me understand what's driving this volatility and then how we should think about the margins there going forward. I mean I understand it is just about that better over time and this has been a lot of sort of quarter-to-quarter volatility there? Thanks.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Other includes a variety of businesses, let me just run through each of them. One is specialty materials, which have been affected by the transaction where we purchased the ETHAFOAM product line from Dow. It also includes our medical business. We also did an acquisition in.2007. It includes our renewable products where essentially we are investing for the future, sales are relatively modest. So, that's a negative effect on overall margin segment for the business and the fourth is a new technology we acquired early in '07. NanoPore, which is a super insulation material, again which is a net investment, and I think what you're seeing in the volatility of margin line is more of the spending on the investments and less the sales growth of the two businesses, specialty materials and medical, which are further down the maturity curve. That is about the simplest way to explain it Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "That's helpful, and so as I think about sort of 2008, probably looking at more of sort of how the fourth quarter played out is probably a better base to be looking at than necessarily the first quarter of last year just given that you have acquired these businesses, and the investments are sort of going forward in some of the others, is that right?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not sure the fourth quarter is anymore representative. I think once you look at the number for the year, the full number, because that balances out some of the bumps that happen when you are spending on new technologies.", "Claudia Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ingalls & Snyder, Rosemarie Morbelli has the next question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Hi, good morning all.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Just following up. Hello.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Rosemarie.", "Operator", "Rosemarie, please press star one at this time.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've lost Rosemarie for some reason.", "Operator", "Yes, please go ahead Ma'am.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Can you hear me now?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we can Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Alright, I should be on TV with that. When\u2026 just following up on the segment question. If you eliminate the impact of the different acquisitions during the year, would the margin of the existing businesses have actually improved '07 over  \u201806?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Dave.", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, as Bill indicated, the acquisitions as well as the spending on new projects, the new ventures had a significant impact. I can't say that in the fourth quarter, there was as I indicated in the prepared remarks an impact in our North American foam business related to volumes in resins. That I think had a significant impact on some of these other factors in the quarter's performance. I don't have an answer at hand, Rosemarie, for you on the year-to-year comparison given the number of things that took place during the year in that segment, but if you would like to follow up with us after the call, we will try to pass through that with you.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "The one thing I might say, Rosemarie, and this is just sort of back in the envelope is that if you take out the new ventures out of that and look at the medical and the specialty materials by themselves, specialty materials business is pretty dependent on polyethylene as one of its principal raw materials for polyethylene specialty foams and that was substantially higher in the fourth quarter of '07 than in '06. So, in that particular part of the other category, you would have seen a lower operating margin in '07 than in '06. Yes, that would be the case.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Okay. And in your expectations for 2008, Bill, do you just have a slowdown or flattish North American business or even slightly down or do you actually have a full fledged recession with its impact, whatever impact it is going to have on the global economy, the low end of your range?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's the economist question of the year. My own personal view, and it is my personal view, is that we will see very slow growth in the US. I am not sure it will turn negative. We will also see a slower growth in Europe, but I don't think a recession, but that's again my view.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Okay. And that is... is that the worst case scenario, which you have at the low end of your range?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "That could be yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Okay. I'll get back on queue.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Okay thanks. Ross?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, good morning.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I just had a couple of questions. Bill, could you just talk a little bit more about Food Solutions. If I heard you correctly, I thought you said that you think you've 10% to 15% organic growth ex-currency acquisitions over the next several years, does that apply to 2008 as well. And could you just elaborate on the drivers a little bit more there?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, the drivers are... I mean Food Solution is basically taking us into a space that we really never had a big footprint, and as you may have heard me say when I outlined where we wanted to take the food part of our business, is we are very well established with a very solid footprint and market presence in kind of prepare at home foods. We got a... we have been in that segment for a long time. But as more and more food consumption is either eating outside the home or eating away from home or prepared outside the home and brought in, it's a market that we have really had a very small footprint, and then two years ago, we decided it was a real growth opportunity and we have identified ready meals and food service and prepared meals as segments, where there was a real opportunity for us to grow and whether it\u2019s institutional feeding with bulk packaging of mashed potatoes and cream spinach, which we do for a lot of the food service outlets, we do QSRs, we do table cloth restaurants, we do institutions as well as some of the new products we introduced Pizza Fresh which is an overwrapped fresh pizza that supermarkets are selling. We have got some applications for frozen pizza trays. It\u2019s just a relatively fast-growing segment and our 10% to 15% number, we feel is a pretty good place to be. We've also introduced in this segment aseptic packaging which gets at a segment of the market where there is really no player which is an aseptic package, that is greater than two leaders, on up to 20 leaders where we think that's an opportunity as well as retort packaging, which [inaudible]. It\u2019s an alternate to the can. So, for us we see all of those as opportunities where we can take our technology. We are seeing good reception in most parts of the world, we're doing rice and beans in Mexico, we are doing chilly in the United States, we are doing tomato pasta sauce in Europe, offer institutional feeding and it is... I think it is an exciting segment for us to be in.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "These are 10% growth.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Pardon me Bill.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "That's how we see the 10%.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, okay. Thank you for that. And then a follow-up question. You pulled out $7.5 million of advisory expenses, which you said are incurred prior to ceasing work on an acquisition. Can we assume that you're not contemplating a large acquisition at this time?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Let me say that the company has always looked at acquisitions. At the end of the day, we make our decisions on value on return to shareholders. Our goals in an acquisition are to increase our global footprint, to reduce our dependence on fresh meat, to reduce our dependence on the polyethylene cycle, and we look at businesses, which present those opportunities. If at the end of the day, the numbers don't work for either the shareholders or the company, we cease  pursuing that particular transaction. That's about all I can say.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "[inaudible] has the next question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning. Just a follow on the last question, you guys have talked about in previous conference calls that the pilots they are going on with Case-Ready and vertical pouch packaging, can you talk a little bit about, Bill, how many pilots you have going on, the status of those pilots, and then as a part of your comment, you also talked about Mirabella. Can you talk about what the status is with that product?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Actually I go beyond pilots, we are commercial on everything I have said. I mean I said in my prepared comments overall Case-Ready is $450 million plus business, another double-digit growth rate in '07. We continue.. we continue to expand the Case-Ready formats. I think we have [inaudible] Mirabella being the latest which is what I particularly like, because it addresses one of the concerns with the earlier Case-Ready formats, where... if you remember, if you look at the supermarket, you see the current Case-Ready formats have a very high tray for a lid on top of it. Mirabella allows you to reduce the profile of the tray. The film actually goes across the meat, it maintains its red bloom, you do get longer shelf life and you really reduce material usage, so it is not only a lower cost pack, but it is a better environmental pack. We have only got one supermarket commercial on it, but if you look at the $450 million of Case-ready, there's a variety of tray lid, there is Mirabella, there is Darfresh, there is Darfresh bloom, there is a whole variety of offerings that make up that $450 million of Case-Ready. So, maybe that is one beyond the pilot, so is vertical pouch. Vertical pouch is a business that we are continuing to grow into, invest in, where we have got aseptic formats, we have got retort formats, we have got refrigerated formats, and again that business grew at 16% in 2007. So those are fully commercial products.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yeah, maybe I just want to try to ask that question a little bit differently to understand what you're saying, but I think last quarter you had kind of alluded that there were a number of pilot programs and what I'm getting at is, just the number of incremental opportunities that you see out there, with people that maybe haven't used these products before. What are they looking at in giving you in terms of feedback and readiness to move forward?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Mirabella pilot was one company, we have now got three retailers. Darfresh bloom is new, we have got\u2026 there we do have pilot customers. We've got a [inaudible]. Maxine Spencer really like the environmental aspects as well as the ease of handling and machine ability. [Inaudible], which is another way of displaying fresh cold cuts and cheeses, which has been partnered in North America and Latin America. Those are still being well received. I mean we haven't... I haven't pulled the plug on any of our new product offerings at this point, maybe that's a simple way of saying it, yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great. And then just one other question. Tyson talked the other day about raising prices substantially. Kraft their dairy prices announced this morning were 40% up. Can you talk a little bit about as those companies continue increase pricing and you see pricing in general go up, what's the impact on your business and mix from those higher cost?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Well, to the extent that the Tysons and the Krafts are our customers and you have seen. And it doesn\u2019t surprise anyone that there has been a worldwide increase in food prices, whether it's in North America or China where pork is up 40% or parts of Europe where dairy. And I think the fact that our customers are raising prices improves their profitability, which makes them stronger customers to our offerings.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Mark?", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Hello.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Mark?", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, Bill, it's Mark Wilde. Just when you walked us through all of those segment outlook this morning, with everyone you talked about getting margins up and I wonder if we just look at this supplemental sheet that you've provided us this morning. If you go back to 2003, your EBITDA margins for the company were up around 20.5%. On this last year, you are little over 16, what do you think is a reasonable kind of bogie that we might look for over the next two or three years?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start. I mean one of your colleagues mentioned that there has been a multiyear climb in petrochemical feedstocks and what as... whether they stabilize or whether they decline, I think Mark the vehicle we need is some stability to get those margins back. Right now, we've been chasing the rising prices like many people in our space. And as you heard me say, it doesn\u2019t matter unless the absolute price of the risen than the stability of it. And I still believe that the business has the capability to get to 18% plus. 20% might be a longer-term target as we bring on some new non-petrochemical based components and yet one of our goals is to build our portfolio to longer-term, reduce our dependency on the petrochemical feedstock cycle. But in my view, some stability over a period of time in petrochemical feedstock will give us the ability to get to an 18% kind of plus EBITDA margin.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. This is a follow-on Bill, again the supplemental tables, I noticed that the growth rate in the fourth quarter in Latin America and Asia-Pacific was quite a bit lower than your full year growth rate. Should we make anything of that, is there any deceleration that you're seeing in those parts of the world?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Not really. I mean I haven't seen anything. There is this whole question of whether the US slow down is going to affect some of our major trading partners. And Mexico is one of our larger businesses in Latin America and of course they're very close trading partner to the US. In Asia Pacific, I think you're primarily seeing Australia where essentially their beef export; a lot of their meat exports have been adversely affected by the strengths of their currencies. That is  necessarily a slowdown in the economy, but their currency, the appreciation of their currencies have made them less competitive on the global market. So, they probably lost meat share to other parts of the world including Brazil.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, thanks. Well, that's very helpful.", "Operator", "[inaudible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. Hi, just a little confusion on, you guys always break out this global manufacturing systems and try a strategy and try and explain it as thoroughly as you can. I understand that. But I'm just curious as to how it is supposed to show up in the income statements. You guys talk about $3 million in this quarter being... and then, I'm talking about the excess over CapEx now, what you're charging on the income statement? You claim $3 million in this quarter, but it doesn't show up as a charge. Now we're talking about $30 million this year and I'm just wondering if we're going to see $7 million as a separate line item charge or is it just going to be embedded in the line item. And then my follow on question to that is the number never seems to hit... I always think this $100 million number is a really big number. The number never seems to come close to getting to the numbers that you guys gave in terms of... they're a lot lower which is a positive. But can you explain to me are they really going to get to that number, I mean is it just a very conservative number? So, that was the second question.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I'll ask Dave to respond to that.", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "The total expense we're referring to here, the other cost that go through the P&L, and back in 2006, when we introduced this strategy, we pegged that spending at $90 million to $100 million. The elements that make up that spending are training of the workforce at these new plants, the inefficiency as those plants build capacity up to full utilization, costs of reducing employment or rearranging equipment at existing facilities, and in the case of a plant we closed early in 2007 restructuring and closure cost. So, there are a number of costs that go into the estimated $90 million to $100 million. The number this year was $12 million; we've run about $3 million a quarter on that. It's not significantly out of line; it is actually a little bit less than the spending in 2006. The spending that we're projecting to go through the P&L in 2008 is $30 million. If we didn't think that was the right estimate, we would have provided a lower number. We always caveat that, these decisions underlying the timing of these investments are subject to change and that some of these expenses may move into a future period or may get eliminated altogether. But for modeling purposes today, we are guiding that. Those expenses are going to approximate $30 million.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, thank you Dave. Operator, I am going to take a few questions that came in over the Internet, and I will read the question and then I will answer it.", "First question came in over the Internet says, looking at your Asia-Pacific sales of $600 million, how much of that relates to food packaging versus medical and how would you describe your forward three-year sales goals in that region for food packaging and medical?", "The break down right now in that part of the world, it's about 68% of the sales were in the food business, about 25% of the sales are in the protective business, and the balance which should be about 7% is in the other category, which combines specialty materials and medical. Our expectation for growth in that region and I will separate the region into two parts, because the Asia part and the Pacific part, I think have two different profiles. The Pacific part, which includes our business in Australia and New Zealand are more mature and probably more consistent with the guidance I gave for the mature food packaging business in the 4% to 6% range. I would expect the Asia part of that business, both in food and in medical to continue to grow at double-digit rates for the next three years.", "Second question coming off of the Internet says, the global manufacturing charge of $3 million is included in what particular operating segment?", "The $3 million is, $2.3 million of that is in food packaging, $0.5 million or 500,000 is in protective, and $0.2 million or 200,000 is in other.", "Next question is you have $300 million worth of Senior Notes coming due in April. Do you plan to pay it off with cash or draw in your revolver?", "Dave, would you answer that one?", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "One or the other. It is a dollar denominated issue. So, we will need cash in the US to pay that off. There are tax implications involved in repay trading cash into the US. So, we will be making a determination over the next couple of months as to the most efficient source funds to retire the notes. My best guess right now is it's going to be a mix of some of the cash that we have on the balance sheet and borrowings, both on our committed revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I think just to add positive comment to Dave's reply is that, I do feel very confident that even in the troubled financial markets of today, Sealed Air does have the ability to issue debt.", "Let me take another question from the Internet, if I can. It is a far away from where I am sitting.", "Is Sealed Air currently participating in any Grace related settlement discussions, would you be surprised if a settlement is not announced in the next six months?", "No quarter goes by without one question on that. The answer is no, we are not involved with any settlement discussions with Grace at the present time. We do know there is hearings going on, and I am not close enough to know the outcome or the progress of those, so I think that's better left to people more knowledgeable than I am.", "As far as the likelihood of the settlement, Dave has commented every year for the last six years, it is always at least a year away and I see no reasons to change our view on that. Okay I think we are just about out of time. If I could take one more question from the Internet, because I see on the telephone we are getting repeats.", "Okay, I'm trying. Someone asked about our resin purchases as either a percent of sales or percent a cost of sales. We don't really talk about that, but I just  eyeballed the numbers and it's less than 40% of our cost of sales and that is about as kind of granular that I wanted to go.", "Okay. I think some of the others begin to repeat. Can we go back to the telephone line? I don\u2019t know if we heard from George Staphos yet. George, can I take your question?", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Is my phone on Bill? I would like to get one question in. Hi guys, good morning, congrats on the year. I guess a couple of questions very quickly. It would appear that global manufacturing cost is something on the working capital in the quarter. I jumped on a little bit late in the call, but I did hear some of your discussions Dave. Could you put a number on that or what you think the working capital billed will be involved in implementing global manufacturing and that's hopefully goes reverse in years coming up?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Well, actually George, I think one of the highlights certainly from the CFO seat in the quarter was the $22 million reduction in inventory. Despite the start up of operations in China and sort of the ongoing increase in operating activity in Mexico, there is a...", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "I understand that, but my point is was there some billed even with those good numbers that will ultimately accrue back to you overtime, once the GMS is more fully operational?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I think the answer is yes. In talking about GMS, we've commented that we are currently supplying significant demand in these growing areas of the world with exports from the US and to a lesser extent Western Europe. That's a very long supply chain, when you consider that inventory on transit as well as the additional inventory that we have to warehouse as a safety stock in these markets. As we expand our local production, we can take significant work in process and finished goods inventory out of the system. So, the expectation would be that as production at these sites ramps up, while there will be some additional inventory related to maintain those plans that the overall impact on our working capital will be favorable.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Question on acquisition. Tagging along on an earlier question. Presumably you are always looking at acquisitions as you already said that. I don't know if it's Bill, Mary or Ryan shuttling around going target-by-target, but traditionally you had a pretty low key approach on that type of work, and I guess. I think I know the answer here, but what color can you share in terms of why you decided to  just close that in this quarter? You had some cost associated with transactions that ultimately didn't materialize?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "I am not sure I understood the question George.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Well, you are always looking at acquisition, why this quarter did you decide to reflect on the cost associated with one that didn't across the goal line?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I guess the simple reason is that it was a pretty meaningful number, which would suggest we may have gotten pretty far down the path before we saw it...  ceased the process and that's basically the only reason. Most of the... most of the transactions we look at you can pretty much make a decision relatively early in the process before you've committed a lot of resource to it. In this case that wasn't the case.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "I guess that is also a way of conveying that, whatever process might be ongoing is now formally closed. I guess last thing\u2026 I know you said that we've raised the   settlement and reorganization, you are not close enough to the hearings right now to know what might be occurring, but have you picked up at all from your contact whether there might be any curve balls coming relative to what had been your previously agreed to settlement with the assessment plaintiff. Thanks guys, good luck in the quarter.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "George, as far as the Grace issue, the various plans, even the plaintiff\u2019s plans do recognize our settlement as part of any proposed reorganization, I haven't seen anything other than that.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, thanks very much.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, we just have two left out there. Rosemarie I can't resist taking your second call.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Oh well, that is very sweet of you, I appreciate it. You said something regarding the slower rate of slaughter, and that you were actually\u2026 you know, your red meat sales or sales to red meat packaging were growing faster than the slower rate. Do you think that there is some... I don't know frozen inventories being built up, and at some point you'll will catch up with the slower rate or are you really getting so many more accounts that even in a slower slaughter environment, you can still grow faster than that?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think the short answer Rosemarie is we've been very successful at gaining business in a slower slaughter environment, that's the simple way of saying it. Yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "And if I may follow up on that, if my memory serves me right, the margin on packaging red meat is higher than that of the other proteins, particularly chicken, but I guess it is also slower than for pork. As we go into a slow environment and maybe recession, do you see some kind of change in mix and therefore we would see a lower margin on your Food Packaging?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "We went through 2001, if you remember that tech sort of recession in 2001, and I think I might have made the same comment in 2001, and you'll probably have it in your notes somewhere, is that to the extent people who are consuming less beef we were able to make it up on chicken and poultry, even though you are right. It is a lower margin packaging, because less technology goes into packaging poultry than in beef. I think you've heard me say a number of times, the hierarchy of profitability is beef, pork and chicken. But don't forget ground beef. Ground beef is oftentimes just as accessible and just as desirable as chicken in periods of economic slowdown. And what I've also learned is one of the faster growing foods in economic slowdowns is pizza, be it frozen or chilled pizza. So, if you see people ordering more pizza Rosemarie, hold on to your wallet.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Oh, fine, I will, thanks a lot.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, one more last question from Mark, if you are still there?", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Yeah, I am. I just have been watching all these stories on... you know the pressure on plastic grocery sacks, I guess the Chinese are talking about banning them. Is there something structurally different going on here you think that kind of affects the whole packaging business, particularly the plastic side of the equation or is it just kind of  noise?", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "No, no, I think, no, I think, Mark, I am not sure we've reached the tipping point, but you kind of get there over time, and when it happens, you never know what it was till after it has happened. But having been through a number of environmental cycles over the years, I think this one may have more substance than in the past, which is why we've invested in renewable products. We got two renewable offerings both based on annually renewable crops. One is based on PLAs, which is polylactic acid, which is basically polymerized corn and there is demand for that. We are essentially sold out. We basically can sell everything we can make. Our other is from our new startup, Biosphere where we are continuing to approach the market from kind of a different end with a different technology. The advantage of the Biosphere product is it's not in the food chain. There is longer-term concern about corn-based plastics as being a conflict in the food chain which is yet to be settled out, but that's why I think our second technology, which is based on a non-food chain product may end up also being viable. So, no, we are investing in both of those technologies. In fact we've just invested capital to expand our capacity to make PLA trays. So, we see it as an important component of our business and something we not only need to be sensitive to, but we've got to make it part of our strategy. One of the company's strategic goals in 2007 which we sat down with the managing group a year ago and so we wanted to introduce at least one sustainable product by the end of 2007, we actually have two. So, clearly it's high on our priority list, and we think it will be an important component of our business going forward.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay, that's good. That's the kind of response I was listening for, thanks Bill.", "William V. Hickey - President, Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Operator, I would like to wrap up here and I want to thank all of you for participating in the call today. I'd also like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for your efforts and hard work in 2007. I know it was a challenging year, but everybody remained focused. You all continued to execute our plans and contributed to our success and the momentum that we carry into 2008. We will continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth in the New Year, with leading product innovation. We'll continue to build upon our leadership position globally, by furthering our presence in the BRIC regions as well as the more developed regions of the world. And we will continue to deliver shareholder value as we reduce costs and continue to generate significant cash flow. We have successfully navigated to the challenging conditions before and demonstrated our ability to insolate our business from downturns. We have continued to build upon these strengths, which have served us well during the year and will continue to serve us into 2008. It is for these and many more reasons that I am very happy and proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder. Thank you all for taking your time to listen to us today.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's teleconference.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, we have William V. Hickeyy, President and Chief Executive Officer and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management\u2019s prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator instructions] We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question per caller so that others will have a chance to ask their questions.", "And now at this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I\u2019d like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management\u2019s outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us.", "Our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We have also posted supplemental financial information and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we expect to discuss on our website at sealedair.com in the investor relations information section under Reports & Filings.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Amanda and good morning everyone. I am Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today, in addition to Amanda, we have Dave Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer. As an introduction I will provide a few highlights of of our business for the first quarter of 2008. Dave will then review select details of our financial results. And after Dave\u2019s remarks, we will take your questions.", "As you saw up by our press release issued earlier today, we expected that the first quarter would be challenging, due to rising raw material and energy cost, and continuing sluggish growth in the North American economy. In spite of this, we generated a modest increase in product price and mix, and held volumes steady, with a help of new product sales, and the recent acquisition of the Ethafoam and related product lines. We also achieved double-digit growth in our Vertical Pouch Packaging portfolio in our medical application business and in various emerging regional markets.", "In the first quarter, our diluted earnings per share were $0.35, excluding the special items mentioned in our press release earlier this morning. We accomplished this earnings performance while absorbing raw material cost for the first quarter that was $37 million higher than the first quarter of 2007 and $11 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2007.", "During the quarter, we anticipated continuing weak economic conditions in North America and higher input cost for the duration of the year. As a result, we focused on the following initiatives to mitigate the impact. First, we recently announced the operational exchange at one of our facilities in the U.K., which will improve our performance by moving certain equipment to other locations, while reducing headcount at that location.", "We also announced the closure of a facility in New Jersey, shifting production to other existing facilities in the United States. We have implemented additional price increases in various businesses and regions of the world and we have targeted cost savings opportunities in SG&A and manufacturing for the year.", "Looking ahead into the rest of the year, we plan on mitigating higher cost through a combination of efforts. Focusing on certain items in more detail, first, we are implementing additional price increases. We are on track to complete our conversion on to the SAP platform midyear in North America, which will enhance efficiencies across our global platform. Having brought all of our major European sites live on SAP last year, we will be simplifying our business processes in Europe in an effort to streamline that regions operations to increase efficiencies and support profitable growth.", "We are on track with our global manufacturing investments and are investing in the final expansions of our new facility in Mexico, and the opening of our new facility in Poland later this year. And of course we will continue to stringently control headcount and spending.", "Finally, we are diligently focusing our spending dollars on profitable growth opportunities for 2008.", "Let\u2019s take a look at our performance for the first quarter and review our sales results in more detail. Our first quarter sales increased 8% to set another record of $1.2 billion. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation, our sales growth was largely driven by a combination of the benefits from the recent acquisitions of the Ethafoam product lines and Alga Plastics, both of which are reported in the other category and increases in product price and mix.", "We did see a combined 16% sales increase in the BRIC countries of the world as well as double-digit sales growth in the developing regions overall. Taking a closer look at our reportable segments in the other category; our food packaging business showed steady performance in the first quarter. Net sales grew at 7% or if excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency at 2%. Product price mix had a 1% growth reflecting the benefits of our December 2007 price increase, which were not fully realized in the first quarter.", "Overall, volume growth grew just under 1%. We saw solid volume growth in the United States, Europe and Asia which all performed above slaughter rates. These results were offset by volume declines in Australia and New Zealand and in Latin America. Australia was impacted by unfavorable weather conditions, and Latin America was impacted by the EU embargo on Brazilian meat imports.", "Operationally we continued the ramp-up phase of our new greenfield site in Shanghai, China; and Monterey, Mexico; and added new production lines in Latin America.", "Looking ahead we anticipate continued strength in our European and U.S. food packaging businesses. We expect stronger year-over-year meat production across all meat categories in the United States, and we expect processing to increase in Australia in the second half of the year.", "Additionally, we expect that the recent trade agreement to reopen the full export of U.S. beef to South Korea will have a favorable impact on this segment starting mid-year. We do expect however, the current meat supply constraints in China and Brazil to persist.", "In Food Solutions, we increased our sales by 10% in the first quarter or 3% excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. Product price mix increased by 3% in the quarter due to the benefits again of our December 2007 price increase. Unit volume growth was relatively steady on a year-over-year basis with a 0.4% increase. Although we achieved over 20% volume growth in Asia and mid-single digit volume growth in Latin America and Australia, New Zealand, volume growth was offset by a decline in unit volume in the United States.", "This was due primarily to a decline in the Case-Ready portfolio as one large retailer has opted to use an alternative packaging format for a portion of their fresh meats. We\u2019re participating in this alternate format however the results of those sales are reported in the food packaging segment. Excluding the slowdown in our North America in Case-Ready results, the Case-Ready portfolio grew by over 10% outside the United States in the first quarter.", "Additionally we have made good progress among other large U.S. retailers and are currently piloting the Case-Ready format with a large multi national retailer in Shanghai, as we continue to expand Case-Ready\u2019s presence in the marketplace. Also another retailer in the United States is piloting our newest Case-Ready format Mirabella in the next few weeks.", "The Vertical Pouch Packaging portfolio did continue to grow at double-digit rates during the quarter with particularly strong sales in North America. Lastly, our Ready Meal Solutions continue to expand with simple steps, our microwaveable heat-and-eat system increasing nearly 20% year-over-year.", "Looking ahead, assuming economic conditions continue to soften, we feel well positioned in participating in the packaging of fresh, prepared meal that are accessible to many people at an affordable price.", "Moving on to our protected packaging segment, first quarter net sales were 0.6%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the unfavorable impact from the sale of the small product line, first quarter sales decreased slightly by 2%.", "We experienced moderate growth in product-price mix, again reflecting our recent December 2007 price increases. This was offset by volume declines in all regions except Asia, which had a 7% volume increase. Volume was negatively impacted by the continuing weakness in the North American and European economies.", "Looking ahead, we anticipate continued slow growth rates in both our North American and Europe Protective Packaging business due to regional economic condition, which we expect to partially offset with sales of new products.", "Lastly, our other category increased net sales by 39% or 33% excluding the favorable affect of foreign currency translation. The primary growth driver in the first quarter were the acquisitions of Alga Plastics in medical packaging in August, and the acquisition of Ethafoam Products in November. Volume increased 6% primarily due to strong sales in Europe and Asia in our medical business. This was slightly offset by declining sales volumes in North America in the specialty materials business.", "Looking ahead we will continue to focus on integrating and scaling our recent acquisitions. Our manufacturing teams are focused on establishing the internal manufacturing assets for Ethafoam Product lines, to transition production in house and improving operating margins.", "Before I hand it over to Dave I\u2019d would like to discuss our updated full year 2008 guidance. Based on the market conditions that we see today, as well as the other items I just reviewed we now expect our full year 2008 diluted earnings per common share to be at the lower end of our previously announced range $1.64 to $1.74. This range of course includes charges of approximately $21 million or $0.11 per share, which are expected to be incurred related to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy.", "Excluding these charges we now expect our 2008 earnings to be at the lower end of our previously announced range of $1.75 to $1.85 per share. The change in our guidance will reflect the following updated assumptions.", "We now expect full year average raw material cost to be considerably higher than initially anticipated earlier this year. Addition price increases to recover these higher costs are planned.", "Our consolidated unit volume growth rate in 2008 will be lower than we initially expected, which is consistent with expectations for slow growth in the global economy.", "We\u2019re also assuming a lower full year effective tax rate of 29.6% and we expect to maintain operating expenses of less than 16% of net sales. Combined with being disciplined in our spending, mitigating rising costs in an efficient manner and investing wisely in our growth programs, I expect that our efforts will position Sealed Air as a more efficient, more profitable and more nimble organization as the global economy recovers in late 2008.", "Now, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance. Dave?", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, our sales grew $1,117,000,000 for the quarter, more than 80% of our $83 million of revenue growth where $69 million came from our international operations.", "Stable foreign translation contributed $57 million, while international volume grew 3% to $3 million or five-tenth of a percent. For the quarter, approximately 56% of our revenue came from outside the United States. The net revenue impacts from acquiring this divesting businesses was $14 million or 1.3% for the quarter, two acquired businesses contributed $20 million to 2008 revenue in our other category and we also netted out $6 million of first quarter 2007 contributed by the small protective packaging product line that was sold last year.", "For those participating in the call, who\u2019d like additional detail, tables posted on our website sealedair.com present the percentage of sales by geographic region, the components of the change in net sales by business segment and by geography, and the impact of foreign currency translation on sales by geographic region.", "Moving through our statement of operations, the company\u2019s gross profit was $305 million for the first quarter compared with $314 million in the first quarter of 2007. For the total company, resin costs in the quarter were $37 million higher, compared to the prices paid for resins in the first quarter of 2007. The selling price increases that we announced late last year and then in the first quarter lagged our increased cost for resins and thus the benefits were not fully realized in the first quarter of 2008. Cost related to our global manufacturing strategy did not have a meaningful impact on our first quarter gross profit comparison to 2007.", "Marketing, administrative and development expenses were $186 million compared to $178 million in the first quarter of 2007. As a percent of revenue, these overhead expenses declined to 15.8% compared with 16.3% in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding foreign currency translation of $9 million, marketing, administrative and development expenses were flat, compared to the first quarter of 2007. Cost containment efforts were implemented earlier in the first quarter, as we assessed that economic conditions were likely to compare unfavorably to our earlier outlook for 2008.", "Operating profit was $117 million for the first quarter, a decline of $19 million from the first quarter of 2007. The combination of price and mix contributed $13 million to offset only partially, $37 million of higher resin costs. Operating profit as a percent of sales was 9.9%. Food Packaging operating profit was flat compared to the prior year and Food Solutions reported a modest year-over-year decline in operating profit. Protective Packaging operating profit was $12 million below 2007 due to unfavorable sales volume and resin cost that also impacted gross profit.", "The other category, which includes specialty materials, medical applications and our investments in new ventures, namely NanoPore and Biosphere reported a year-over-year decline of $3 million of operating profit during the quarter. This decline was attributed to the more pronounced impact of resin cost increases on our Specialty Foams business.", "Interest expense was $35 million essentially unchanged from 2007. Other income for the quarter was $200,000 a decrease of $4 million compared to last year. The company expensed an additional $1 million in the quarter for services performed by third parties on a transaction for which work has now ceased. Foreign currency exchange losses were $2 million unfavorable in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 2007.", "Interest income was $4 million this year compared to $5 million in last year\u2019s first quarter, in part, reflecting the movement of funds prepared for the repayment of debt in April. Income tax expense for the quarter was $21 million and resulted in an effective income tax of 25.4%. The lower tax rate for the quarter resulted from a favorable mix of earnings, as well as benefits associated with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings.", "For 2008, our total effective income tax rate is estimated to be 29.6%. This rate is lower than the 31% rate that we guided at the end of January, due primarily to a more favorable mix of earnings, as well as benefits associated with the repatriation of certain foreign earnings.", "Diluted earnings per common share were $0.33 for the quarter compared to $0.67 in the prior year. Excluding those items detailed in our supplement information available on our website, sealedair.com, diluted earnings per share were $0.35, compared to $0.39 for 2007, a decline of 10%. As stated in today\u2019s earnings press release, this EPS is consistent with achieving the low end of the EPS guidance range, we provided in our January press release.", "I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Our combined balance of cash and short-term investments at March 31s, was $431 million. Some noteworthy sources and use for the cash during the quarter were; EBITDA of a $162 million, capital expenditures of $41 million, share buybacks of $27 million, and the dividend payment of $19 million.", "Our quarter end accounts receivable totaled $796 million up a nominal $6 million from December 31st. Compared to March of last year, receivables investment increased $92 million or 13%, while our quarter-over-quarter sales increased $83 million or 8%.", "Customer receivables balances outside North America were up double-digits with foreign currency translation contributing $16 million or 80% to the year-over-year increase. Also representative of our international business, VAT receivables were up $11 million year-over-year.", "Inventory investment at March 31st was $642 million, up $61 million during the quarter. This higher investment is attributed to acquisitions, foreign exchange and normal seasonal increases. Compared to March 31st of last year, inventory investment was up $97 million or 18%.", "Inventories in the U.S. were up only $20 million year-over-year. The increased investment in inventories outside the U.S. was attributable to $50 million of foreign currency translation and $22 million primarily to support our sales growth internationally.", "Total borrowings at the end of March were $1.882 billion, an increase of only $10 million, primarily due to an increased in short term borrowings related to our Greenfield plant startup in China.", "The outstanding balance of $300 million related to a debt issue maturing on April 15th 2008 is reported in current liabilities at March 31st As planned, we used our available committed bond capacity, including both our accounts receivables securitization program and our credit facility to retire these notes when they matured on April 15th.", "Capital expenditures were $41 million for the quarter. Of this spending, $9 million was incurred on projects undertaken as part of our global manufacturing strategy. Looking ahead our guidance continues to be for 2008 capital spending to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million. This outlook includes $70 million necessary to complete the first phase of our global manufacturing strategy.", "In concluding my comments our financial performance, I\u2019d like to summarize the status of our global manufacturing strategy. The expected $70 million of capital investment in 2008 will bring our cumulative capital investment from 2006 through 2008 to $143 million. This will essentially complete the first phase of our global manufacturing strategy within our expected range of $130 million to $150 million.", "We are producing and selling products from our Greenfield plant in China and our new location in Mexico. By this time next year we expect to be producing and selling product from our new site in Poland.", "In addition to our capital investment we have previously estimated that other costs associated with expanding our global manufacturing base, and establishing centers of excellence, would be $30 million in 2008, bringing our total costs\u2026 our total for other costs to $58 million well below our original range of $90 million to $100 million. In summary, we currently are estimating that our benefits from these projects will be approximately $45 million starting in 2009 and increasing to $55 million in 2010.", "Now, I would turn the call back to Bill and your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Yes, sir, our first question today will come from Ghansham Panjabi from Wachovia Securities, Please go ahead.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities", "Hey guys, good morning.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Ghansham", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities", "You know, Bill, you noted in your comments that you expected the first quarter weakness. Are you suggesting that your first quarter earnings were in line with your forecast back from late January or was it some what lower than what you were thinking?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our, actually, the first quarter was a little bit lower than we anticipated. If you remember Ghansham, when we talked about product cost this year, we anticipated, kind of a mirror image of 2007, where essentially, your peak input cost would be the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2007. If you remember the first quarter of 2007 input costs were down quite a bit. We expected the first quarter to peak input cost and then sort of flatten out and decline theoretically on a parallel basis with a lower ethylene prices. That doesn\u2019t look its happening right now. But our view was that the first quarter, even as we expected would be the weakest quarter of the year, it just was a little bit less than we thought it was, Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And in terms your protective packaging, the environment there\u2026 obviously costs have been an issue for a while now but it also looks like demand is an incremental issue as well. So what\u2019s your strategy to, sort of, go out there and raise prices and there is weak top line high cost environment. Is that fair to say that you\u2019re willing to walk way from business if you have to, as you try to push pricing there?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Ghansham, let me, sort of, go back a second to the first part of your question on the protective side, yes. Some of the sort of declines that we\u2019ve seen is our consumer sales, which are those consumer Wrap Bubbles that sell in big box stores, mainly in the first quarter those were down 23%, primarily because a lot of this superstores have been cutting their inventories. In fact one of the office supply store has announced this morning that their sales were down 7% to 12%.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities", "Right.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Product going into the housing industry about 10%, products going into the automotive industry goes down about 5%, products going in to RVs, boats, sports, recreation are about 10% and those that go to the luxury end and you see Bubble Wrap had a lot of luxury products and that\u2019s down about 5%. So, clearly that segment of the economy, the consumer base segment is as weak as I\u2019ve seen it in a long time. The 2001 slowdown was primarily a tech slowdown, this seems to be more consumer based.", "Now, to get back to the second part of your question is, yes, we will put through price increases. We are prepared walk away from low margin business and our view is that with input cost being at the state they\u2019re in, their may not be opportunities for marginal competitors to lower prices and still survive. That is what happens.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And moving on our next question will come from Banc of America securities, George Staphos. You line is open. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks, hi guys. Good morning. Trying to the stay to the one question format here, could you cover it all a bit in more detail, the shift that you saw in Case-Ready, both in terms again what your large customer is doing in terms of their format or material, why that made for a shift in your segments and I didn\u2019t hear this, have you mentioned? Did you actually lose share with this customer where you sold before and now no longer. Thanks.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "George, let me go back to the Case-Ready. First is outside the U.S., the numbers are still extremely positive, 10 plus percent outside the U.S.. As I said down 3% in the U.S., 3.5, that is primarily due to one large retailer taking a certain number of cuts of their case, meat cuts and putting them in to what is called an overwrap package. An overwrap package is a very traditional polystyrene trade with PVC overwrap film, much as of it were done in the back of the store and then those individual packages are put in a large barrier bag and that large barrier bag is then filled with a gas to extend shelf life and then that bag is shipped from the supplier to the distribution center to the retailer. And then the retailer opens that bag. And when the retailer opens that bag essentially they have got 72 hours shelf life.", "So that\u2019s what they\u2019ve gone to, there\u2019s been a change in the merchandised management at this particular retailer. They were looking for a way to drive up their beef sales and may have thought, may be a change back to the original in-store format would work. Kind of the negatives of that, it\u2019s a higher cost format. Its got a, sort of a negative environmental impact in terms of the additional truck loads of meat that have to be delivered. In terms of the PVC film In terms of the spoilage that occurs on the meat because you only a three days shelf life when you open the package.", "I understand that, that retailer has been now open to considering alternatives that may have a better environmental footprint. So there are various studies looking at alternative packaging. And George, if you remember, I\u2019ve said this for a number of years. I think the ultimate Case-Ready format has yet to be developed. I think it\u2019s another step in the process and we are participating in this overwrap bag.", "There may be one or two other people participating in it. There\u2019s not a lot of technology in the overwrap bag. Its basically a large polyethylene type barrier bag. All it has to do is hold the gas for a couple of days. So its not really a high tech format and that\u2019s why we sort of put it in the Food Packaging and we\u2019ll see how it turns up.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities", "Great, thanks. I\u2019ll do that.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll now move on to our next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Good Morning thanks guys.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good Morning.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Could you just talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in emerging markets, its just seem like the core revenue growth in Latin America and Asia was a quite a bit lower than we\u2019ve seen in some time, could you\u2026 I think you touched on some of the trends, but if you could elaborate a little bit more there and what you expect for the balance of the year?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, sure let me give two things on Latin America and the two biggest markets are Brazil and Mexico. Mexico; actually our business along Casa Maca Dor [ph] which is that area right on the border between the U.S. and Mexico, most of that manufacturing ends up going to the United States. And in Mexico, where the growth was hurt in effect was the area where the Maca Dor are where the products are essentially being manufactured in Mexico and sold to the U.S. So, the US slowdown has really affected our protective sales in Mexico.", "The other part of Latin America is Brazil and Brazil the EU has imposed a\u2026 an embargo on Brazilian meat and its basically has to do within our recent EU policy regarding food safety and traceability standards, which essentially requires the Brazilian exporters to have a track and trace system for all of their exports to Europe. And as a result, I think there are 9000 exporters of meat in Brazil and I think at this point 300 of them have been qualified under the new EU rules.", "So the combination of the industrial effect in Mexico on the protective side and EU meat embargo on the Brazilian side where the primary factors in the lower growth in Latin America. The rest of the business in Latin America is pretty healthy and particularly, in Brazil, the Food Solutions business was up, the Protective business was up in Latin America. So overall, there are two impacts in Latin America.", "Coming to Asia, there is a meat supply issue in China. Meat prices are up 40%. Pork prices are up 40% plus. They have had an animal disease, which is a new one on meat called blue-ear. It\u2019s started late last year. It\u2019s resulted in a sizable number of animal deaths, which also has contributed to the higher prices. And again in China, if you look at the other segments of our business, our growth is still quite good. But the meat sector particularly pork has had a negative impact on the business in China.", "Hopefully takes the two pieces together, but overall, I think both Dave and I said in our comments is, we are still pretty upbeat on the BRIC markets, on the emerging markets and so far this year, even including those factors of the pork supply problem in China and the EU exports in Brazil and the negative impact of the U.S. economy on some of the Mexican manufacturing. We still managed to produce 15% plus growth overall in the BRIC countries.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "So was that the higher pork price means lower pork\u2026 I mean as simple as higher pork prices mean lower pork consumption in China or is there something else to understand there?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, but I would say that pork consumption is probably down, interestingly enough one of our U.S. customers has received an order from China for x million pounds, I had the number, I just don\u2019t remember it right off hand, has received an order to export x million pounds of U.S. pork to China to supplement the pork supply. And net-net, that material is going over frozen, so we will not see any really affect of those sales on our business in China, since that pork is coming out of the U.S.", "Ross Gilardi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we will now take our next question from Rosemarie Morbelli from Ingalls & Snyder. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Good morning, Bill. Bill, could you give us some details on the additional cost reduction program that you\u2019re just starting now on both the manufacturing side and the overhead expenses?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I can go through kind of the laundry list. But, yeah, they are the obvious ones, is one, wholly in control of headcount in terms of any open positions; two, doing a better job at managing our travel. The company spends about $80 million a year on travel when you are global organization, that\u2019s a pretty big number. And to the extent, we can say 10% of that that has meaningful impact when it flows to the bottom line.", "On our manufacturing operations, we\u2019re primarily focused on reducing scrap. Despite all the efforts we\u2019ve made, we still regenerate something like 10% of our production ends up being scarp because of changeovers and again taking 1% out of that is a pretty sizable amount to bring right to the bottom line. Those are the biggest items Rosemarie on the list, but Dave Kelsey and I went over the list a couple of days ago, is probably two pages long but 80% of the dollars were in the items I just covered.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "So you have a dollar amount of additional savings coming from this new program, I am\u2026I mean translating this as being an addition to the $45 million savings you generated by the current program underway.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Rosemarie, we do have it. Its in our guidance number, its how we get to the low end of the guidance.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. Okay and what if I may, what would\u2026. what would need to happen in the current environment for you to actually not reach that low end estimate.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "While, we\u2019re doing everything  we can in terms of reaching the low end and that\u2019s based on the assumptions I\u2019ve made, which is considerably higher input cost, the price increases and the cost savings. All of which I think are very achievable. I just want to put a little color on the price increase. Essentially we\u2019re looking to bring down to the bottom line, something in the range of 2% to 3% price increase, to close the gap basically to get to our earnings number. And if you look at the 2005 and 2006 yearend P&L statements, you\u2019ll see that 2% price number is a number we have achieved twice before. So I\u2019m very, very confident that we will achieve the price impact. So I\u2019m at this point comfortable that, we\u2019ve covered as many bases we possible can to get to where we said we\u2019d be this year.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question we will hear from Deutsche Bank\u2019s Mark Wilde. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Good morning, Bill.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Just a question about the protein markets. And I wonder if you can just explain to us how you think about this right now? It sounds to me like this very high feed costs are leading farmers to push a lot more of livestock to market right now, which I think is dampening price, but at some point we are going to see the other side of that, which is less livestock going to market at higher prices. Can you talk about how that is going to affect your business in the short-term and then a couple of quarters down here?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Mark you have hit upon one of the complexities of the protein chain that I have talked about on numerous occasions and here is a time I won\u2019t go through the whole thing. But there\u2019re really three levels in the protein chain and they are all affected very differently by what\u2019s happened.", "For example in the beef business in the U.S., they are basically the cow-calf people, who essentially are those that breed and raise calves. Then there is the feedlot operators, who essentially take them to maturity and fatten them up. Then there are the processors which take the animal and convert it to meat. And our customers are the last of those three. And depending on the leverage in the channel, rising feed prices affect different people. And rising or falling selling prices affect different people.", "So there is not a simple answer to say what the long-term impact is going to be. You are correct in that. There\u2019d be more animals coming to market this year than we had previously anticipated because of the high feed prices. But beef prices had been and they had been high and it just come down a little bit because the herd size has gotten as bad as the operator held cattle off the market to maintain higher prices. The people who are our customers, the processors who buy from the feed lots, are negatively impacted in this entire process because they\u2019re paying higher prices for animals and getting lower prices from consumers.", "So, it\u2019s a continually changing environment but you are right, go back ahead, in the short term, it will result in more cattle coming to market. You may see this following up next year because at some point, they have to hold back some animals to breed, to rebuild the herds for the future and when that occurs, is anyone\u2019s guess.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. But do you think, that in fact could be,  nine to twelve months out yet before we can kind of see the flip side of this?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right, right, yeah. You\u2019re looking at probably at least twelve month out.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah, okay, All right, that\u2019s the answer I was looking for.", "Operator", "And we will now hear our next question from Claudia Houston from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much. Good Morning.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good Morning", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "I appreciate all the color you gave on U.S consumer trends and I was just hoping you can provide little bit more detail on trends in Europe and then may be, more broadly just wondering if trends have started to stabilize at all in either the U.S, or Europe?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me comment in Europe, you\u2019re seeing\u2026 Europe consumer trends are not as negative as the U.S. Some interesting comments in both France and in Italy, we have seen more of a slow down in France and Italy. than we\u2019ve seen in other parts of Europe. Eastern Europe though continues to do well, I mean our business in Russia which is part of our BRIC business is up 28% for the first quarter. So the European consumer appears to be in better condition than the U.S. consumer and as far as consumers outside U.S. and Europe, we haven\u2019t seen any significant change in either the Latin American consumer or the Asian consumer yet.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just in terms of has the trends stabilized at all or if could give us a sense if there is still maybe more room for weakness?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that\u2019s a tough question, because we\u2019re kind of a coincidence indicator so to speak, so we really don\u2019t have a lot of longer term visibility on the market. Usually the packaging end of our customers is a last thing they do. So that the extent that there are any changes going out, we\u2019re generally more coincidence than leading. But our April number seems to be okay, I\u2019ve seen no further deterioration in the month of April from where we have been, so I guess we\u2019ll wait and see, Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Mr. Bob Trout from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks. Good morning guys.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "At the low end of your guidance range, what is your assumption for resin for the second half? Is that consistent with the consultants, and they are expecting like 5% 6% drop in polyethylene?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me answer. Tat has been our earlier estimate in the beginning of the year. In fact I was going to mentioned that when Ghansham asked the first question, where is said our  expectations was that the first quarter would be the highest input cost of the year and that would gradually flatten out beyond that. And ethylene has actually come down and ethylene is one of the components of polyethylene. But what we are seeing and we are seeing now is that and may be your consultants are better than ours, may be I should talk to yours. But we are actually seeing somewhere in the low single digit cents per pound increases going forward from here through at least the third quarter. Whether it falls off in the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t have that in our guidance right now. But you should know that our guidance is based on another several cents increase in input costs through the rest of this year.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Okay, and just a follow-up on resin with the new Middle East capacity for polyethylene and the others that\u2019s supposed to come online. Can you substitute any of your current resin buys for the -- can you substitute some of the resin that\u2019s coming online in the Middle East or what currently buy or is the formula strict enough where the new resin that\u2019s coming out you might not be able to use it anyway?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no, we are able to use anything coming out of the Middle East. We actually do buy resins from different parts of the world. There is capacity in India, in Korea and some coming on in other parts of the world. The Middle East resin capacity expansions have been something we have all been waiting for. They have been delayed now for at least a year. I understand part of that delay is kind of steel shortages and engineering shortages and what had been, 2008 capacity additions are now looking like late 2008, early 2009 and there is a fair amount of capacity coming on stream. And we are able to use it and we look forward to it.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then just lastly on pricing, you said 2% to 3%, I guess is your expectation for the -- or your hope for the rest of the year, is that across every business unit?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That\u2019s company overall.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And actually it breaks out differently by business units depends on what components they have in their particular product mix.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But the number is company overall.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And how much would you take in the first quarter or how much did you announce that may not as fully benefited the result?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "In terms of price increases?", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We had various increases. Again depending on the business, they were 4% to 6% in one business, 6% to 8% in another business and one of our business has higher 10% and there were different dates from late December, January 1st, February 15th, April 15th, there is sort of, each of our businesses has raised prices in different amounts at different times in both the end of \u201807 and early \u201808 in response to the particular input costs in their particular business. And the $13 million that rolled through the first quarter is not all of what we should get based on the announced price increases. So in my earlier comment saying the ability to recover was overall 2% by the end of the year. It\u2019s still the range that we\u2019re looking at and reasonably consistent with our price, our price increases in 2005 and 2006.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks. I have a couple others, then I\u2019ll hop back in the queue.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "All right. And we\u2019ll now hear from Credit Suisse, John McNulty for our next question. Please go ahead.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, good morning. With regard to the food businesses, it does seem like there is lot of puts and takes right now between Europe shutting down Brazil and it looks like South Korea is opening up. When we look at the volumes going forward, should we be\u2026 how should all this net out? Should we be thinking that given the volumes that you put up throughout rest of the year are similar to what you saw this quarter, should they get a better than this? Can you give us a little bit of help on that?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "My overall view John is they will get a bit better later in the year. First of all, the first quarter tends to be the lowest quarter in terms of the food business. It follows all the eating to holidays, all the bulk poultry and beef and pork that are brought to market in the last quarter of the year, the summer sort of barbecue cookout, outdoor eating hasn\u2019t started, it\u2019s generally in a lot of parts of the wallop world this winter. So that it generally is the lowest quarter of the year in terms of meat production and in terms of what we see at out customers and in our own business. So even just seasonally, we will see increases through the second, third and fourth quarter. And as I said in response to an earlier question, we expect more animals to be brought to market this year than we had originally thought because of the high feed costs. So overall, my feeling is that production and our growth in the food packaging side of our business should improve as go through the year.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just one last question, with regard to W. R. Grace now, its now looking like they are going to be coming out of bankruptcy finally. Can you give us just a remainder as to what that means for you in terms of the timing of when you make your payment out, the stock, that type of thing?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, sure John. It was\u2026 I was expecting that question from someone. As everyone knows W. R. Grace announced in early April and it has reached an agreement in principal with the asbestos personal injury claimants committee and the future claimants representatives and the equity holders committee, on terms for present and future asbestos specialist related personal injury claims.", "Grace\u2019s term sheet, which they published after their announcement states that the plan of reorganization will comply with Sealed Air\u2019s settlement agreement and the way the mechanics of the process will work is that at such time as Grace is reorganization plan is submitted to the courts and then approved by the courts.", "When its approved and when Grace comes out of bankruptcy, on that day, Sealed Air will make the payments under a settlement agreement, which is $512.5 million in cash plus accrued interest and 18 million shares of common stock, 9 million prior to the split and we in return will receive all of the indemnities that we bargained for as part of our settlement agreement and we will have all of the benefits of being cleared of any and all liabilities relating to the Grace asbestos liabilities.", "And my feeling is you are still months and months away. I mean, I know there is an agreement in principal, but there is not necessarily, at least I\u2019m not aware of a plan actually having been prepared or submitted and of course approvals are required from a a variety of other parties in the bankruptcy proceedings, including the property damage claimants and zone claimants, as well as committee of unsecured creditors. So by the time that all gets done, we used to say, its at least a year away, now I might change and say its probably under a year but probably not much under a year, I mean, I saw one of the Grace comments they expected to have their plan approved by the end of \u201808 or early \u201809 and that\u2019s probably not bad planning but in my opinion, solely my opinion its likely to drag out a little bit beyond that.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "And one question tied to that. With regard to the 18 million shares, is there some sort of a lockup period for the creditors or the party that\u2019s going to hold them, so that they don\u2019t just come right upto the market or have you?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, they have registration rights. They have registration rights so the shares they get cannot really just come right upto the market and so that they will come\u2026 I expect they will come to us sometime shortly after then and to go through the registration process and would just see how that develops, Sean.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great, thanks for the update.", "Operator", "And now we will hear from [Rahul Agarwal] from Marathon Asset Management. Please go ahead.", "Rahul Agarwal - Marathon Asset Management", "Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s a quick follow up on the previous one actually. In terms of the cash payment, can you give us some ideas as to what the total cash outflow may be as you see them today, and second, how do you plan to fund it?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Dave.  I am going to ask Dave Kelsey answer that.", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The total cash out flow is a combination of the $512 million that Bill just cited plus accrued interest, which by yearend will be approximately $200 million. So we\u2019re looking at roughly $700 million in cash if the settlement were to occur late this year. We have a cash balance on hand, as well as available committed borrowing capacity sufficient to make that payment went it comes to.", "We also expect to have sufficient lead-time to consider a capital markets transaction to raise some of that funding longer term fashion, but that\u2019s decision we\u2019ll make as the date gets little bit closer. I also wanted to elaborate on the revious question on the 18 million shares. For those of you who haven\u2019t followed us throughout this process, to point out that we do include those share in the calculation of our fully diluted EPS.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Dave. Operator, I\u2019m going to take question from the internet, we\u2019ve got a couple here I just want to respond to.", "Operator", "Certainly.", "Unidentified Analyst", "First question coming over the internet says, although the company is a leader in the packaging sector, do you see continued increasing competition effecting medium to long-term growth prospects for Sealed Air.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you for acknowledging our leadership in the packaging sector, I do appreciate that. Competition is a factor but I generally look at competition as stimulus to get better to work harder, to be smarter. I think the impact is less on growth than our ability to continue to achieve the premium valuations we get on our products. But I really do not necessarily see it as an impact on our growth prospects for going forward.", "Next question is from the Internet.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Since 2001, your sales have increased some about $3 billion to $4.7 billion or 54%, but our EBITDA has only grown about 2.5% over the same period resulting in almost an 800 basis points decline in EBITDA margins. Do you think that margins can get back to the 20% level in the long-term or has you cost structure or competitive environment changed permanently?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That\u2019s a good question something we have talked about on a number of occasions. The principal factor in that -- in that 800 basis point decline in EBITDA, the margins is the $300 million plus of input costs, as we watched the oil go from $40 a barrel to $117 a barrel and the impact that has had on all the raw materials that we buy. As I said on numerous occasions, we spent a fair amount of our time chasing price increases to recover those costs and our ability to get back margins will occur when there is a more stable pricing environment. I don\u2019t necessarily say it has to be lower. If we can just have a stable environment, we will work our way back to those higher EBITDA margins. But to clarify, our guidance has been 18% to 20% EBITDA margins. So we may have come off of that a little bit. But I do think 20% is a desirable target. And I think there is nothing fundamental in our business that would prevent us from doing that once we work all of these cost increases over the last several years through the channels and get our margins back up over time.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Third question from the internet sounds like you have decided to retire the April \u201808 notes, whether draw on bank facilities, either a plan to refinance the borrowing with longer return debt issue, what are your thoughts then about issuing something at equity component given where the stock is now?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually we have already paid off the April notes. Those are done. And most of it as Dave indicated in his comment were done with both cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit agreements. We have note plans, know even concept of anything with an equity component at this time. But let me let Dave comment on how we will work through this debt repayment over a little longer term.", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Probably, three things worth commenting on here. First; we do have a convertible debt issuance out there that goes back to 2003, so that is in the market today. For those of who\u2019d like to invest in convertible securities, we have one available. Secondly, the expectation is on the short-term borrowings that we have incurred to retire the note in mid April that cash from operations over the coming year will be sufficient to reduce those borrowings. So there is nothing we are contemplating today as Bill reiterated to go to the capital markets to term out as they say those short-term borrowings. As we get closer to the settlement date on grades and that $700 million cash payment, we will evaluate a number of different funding sources and make the selection based on what we think will be the most effective cost of capital over future period of time. And I will throw in just comment as well that the settlement is tax deductible event for us. We\u2019ve reflected that tax benefits as best we could estimated when we booked the settlement back in 2002. So there will be some netting down of our cash obligation as we close that event through our tax returns.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Dave. Let me take, I\u2019ve got two questions on Internet before I go back to the telephone.", "Unidentified Analyst", "One is, it\u2019s sounds like additional potential PE cost increases are our primary driver for the guidance change rather than specialty resin changes.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I\u2019d just say its overall input cost and more necessarily attributed to either PE or specialty, just say that that applies to our basic petrochemical input costs, both PE and specialty.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Last item on the internet, how would you characterize your appetite with respect to making acquisitions through the remainder of the year?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sealed Air has always been an acquirer. As we said earlier, we acquired the the Ethafoam business from Dow Chemical Company back in November. We acquired Alga Plastics back in August of 2007. So, we\u2019re always interested in the right fit both from a technology standpoint, product standpoint or a market standpoint. And I would think that as market valuations and purchase multiples have come down over the last couple of months that there might be an opportunity sometime in the remainder of the year, but clearly we have nothing in the works at this time. Okay. Operator, can I go back to the telephone questions.", "Operator", "Well, certainly sir. We do have three questions remaining in queue. We will hear from [Jim Stanley] from Merrill Lynch for our next question. Please go ahead.", "Jim Stanley - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, I just had a follow-up on your last comment of.., for one, meaning that you said as response to the internet question, that the updated guidance has a lot to do with all raw material cost I guess going out more than you originally thought. And maybe you already spoke to this and I missed it, but as I look at the first quarter and I am not sure exactly what you\u2019ve said about for the year as far as volumes are concerned. It seems to me that the big disappointment here is more volume related, especially on food packaging side. And so, I was just, was curious as to what maybe your\u2026 this is\u2026 you already said this, but what you are expecting volume-vise through the rest of the year and has that significantly altered versus what you saw a month or two ago?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I did say before I handed the phone over to Dave. I highlighted what our guidance assumptions were at this point in time.", "Jim Stanley - Merrill Lynch", "Okay", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And I\u2019ll just highlight quickly. Our full year average raw material cost to be considerably higher. Additional price increases to recover the higher cost. Consolidated unit volume growth in 2008, lower than we initially expected.", "Jim Stanley - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, I\u2019m sorry.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah and I think our expectations were somewhere in the mid-single digits, and we\u2019re probably in the low single digits in terms of volume growth. So that\u2019s the answer you were looking for.", "Jim Stanley - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Just as a follow on Bill.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "First the freight and logistic issues around the world are getting bigger all the time. Can you just talk about what effect this has on your business both now and in terms of kind of thinking about this global footprint, manufacturing footprint?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, actually the combination of freight cost and container availability has been in the news of late. Our own freight costs are really up in the single digits quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year because we try to manage how we run our freight operations. We do move products across the oceans and we do move products across the hemispheres. We\u2019re finding that we have to schedule more carefully but we have had no really no issues with doing that.", "Costs have gone up but the places where we\u2019re locating our capacity, the places where we are adding investment and equipment and bricks and mortar, are China, Russia and Brazil and when that capacity comes on stream, its actually less freight intensive and less dependent on the shipping channels because in effect we\u2019ll be manufacturing where the markets are growing, right now as I said earlier as we make product in the U.S. and Western Europe and we ship it to Latin America and we ship it to Eastern Europe and we ship it to Asia.", "I\u2019ve said numerous times that we\u2019ve been currently supplying meat business in China from the U.S. and Australia. Now with our plant there we will take X amount of containers out of our network by putting in two new production lines in Latin America. We\u2019ll take Y number of containers out of our network and by expanding production in Poland and Russia, we\u2019ll take X number of truck loads out of our network.", "So I\u2019d like to think that the way we are planting our global footprint is not only where the markets are, but our net reduction in both transportation and logistics cost, as well as environmental footprint, because we\u2019ll be generating less greenhouse gas by moving less material kind of shorter distances. So overall Mark, it\u2019s a great question, I think it positions exactly where we want to be and I think that will be the right place to be in the long-term.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Yeah and then the near term, Bill, you haven\u2019t like raise inventories in some of those emerging markets just to kind of cover yourself.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Dave, talked about inventory a lot, and the answer is yes, the answer is yes, we do. Its interesting but again, the net result of this ought to be lower inventories when this model is put in the place. I just know from our experience that from the time we get a product made in the U.S. to go to a customer in Brazil, it\u2019s a 105 days. To average the 105 days, now x number of those days are inventory on the water or in one of our warehouses. But the extent that and a year from now or six months from now or two years from now, that customer will get product right in Brazil. It will be 15 days or 10 days instead of 105. Inventory will go down. Transportation will go down. We will have a happier customer. I will have a happier CFO and we will all win.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank Securities", "All right. Thanks, Bill.", "Operator", "At this time, we do have one question remaining in the queue and that comes from a follow-up question Goldman Sachs, Bob Trout. Please go ahead, sir.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks again guys.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Bob.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "What\u2019s your assumption for foreign exchange in your full year guidance?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Dave.", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It\u2019s pretty much in line with what we saw in the first quarter. We are not really in the business of projecting where the dollar is going to go versus the euro. That\u2019s clearly the one relationship that has the biggest impact on our translation adjustments. But we do have significant sales in Brazil, in Australia, in the UK. So those currencies versus the dollar also have an impact. For the time being, we tend to take the view that current exchange rates will stay in effect for the balance of the year. I am sure I will be proven wrong, but I am not sure in which direction.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, okay.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "If you have a insight, please tell us Bob.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Unfortunately, I\u2019m not in the business of forecasting that either, but. And then just lastly the follow-up to that earlier question on Protective. I know there is a pretty significant decline in year-over-year volume this quarter and I know you said consumers weak. Are you seeing any indication that people are just trading down for some of the invitation \u2013 the cheaper invitation product, the Bubble Wrap or just different types of installation?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen that Bob, I think, primarily, I\u2019ve seen just declines in consumption. I mean, I have some highlights that have been actually absolutely interesting. For example, one of our big Bubble Wrap customers in Mexico that\u2019s located along the border and they shift to the U.S. I mean, they do blinds for windows, their volume is down 41%, we haven\u2019t watched any share. We haven\u2019t watched the customer, but essentially, this particular customer\u2019s business is down 41%. We have another customer that does automotive lighting whose volume in the first quarter is down 29%. So I don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve lost much in the way of share. You probably always have somebody switching, it\u2019s always a give and take in any industry in any business. But by and large, I would attribute the quarter to perhaps, the sort of weakest consumer economic environment we have seen and probably we as a country have seen in probably the last 10 to 15 years. Someone asked me if I thought it was over yet? Our April number don\u2019t seem to suggest it is. I\u2019m personally optimistic that by the time we get through the third quarter, things will look a lot better. But I\u2019m not going to forecast the economy either.", "But in the meantime, we are going to do the best we can. We\u2019re going to sell as much as we can at the highest price we can. We\u2019re going to keep every customer we can and we are going to find as many new customers as we can. And if I look back over the recessions, if I go back over the recessions, if I look at our Protective business as being the one that\u2019s most exposed to that. The Protective business worst trough that I think I\u2019ve seen in the last 15 plus years has been in the 3.5% to 4% volume range, not really dramatic because we\u2019re so widespread. I think we had what 2.5 or so in the first quarter. So the worst that\u2019s ever been in 15 years is four. I don\u2019t expect this to get there, but we\u2019ll have to see how the economy turns out. Hopefully I\u2019m going to go to spend their rebate checks and we\u2019ll have a good third quarter. But do appreciate the question. Economy is fastening right now because I am listening to different industries. We report quarterly earnings and I guess this is the quarter you want to be commodity producer. This is not the quarter you want to be a manufacturer, hope it turns around next couple of quarters.", "Robert Trout - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks very much.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Are there anymore questions operator?", "Operator", "There are no further questions from the phone audience at this time sir.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I really want to thank everybody for participating in the call. It\u2019s been the challenging quarter, but at least I hope you heard us both of us with prepared comments as well as answering our questions. We\u2019re all focused on the long-term. We\u2019re not going to let the short-term destructions in the economy dramatically change how we want to be. We\u2019re going to stick to our growth initiatives. We\u2019re going to increase our efficiencies. We\u2019re going to reduce our cost, because we truly believe being a global player in the world economy is a place where we want to be. We\u2019ll continue to capitalize on a global footprint and our diverse portfolio. We will drive for lower cost and we will continue to invest in innovation. Long-term, we want to deliver superior results to all of you. You\u2019ve heard me say this before and I will say it again, we have navigated to these challenging environments before and we continue to steadily expand our business. We will continue to build on these strengths, I think they will serve us well through 2008 and beyond. And I am still very happy and proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder. Thank you all very much.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

This call is being recorded.", "Leading the call today we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer, and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management\u2019s prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions].", "And now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Amanda.", "Amanda Butler - Director of Investor Relations", "", "Thank you, Teresa and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management\u2019s outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us, our future performance may be different due to a number factors. And many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, or quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We have also posted supplemental financial information, and reconciliation of non US-GAAP measures, that we expect to discuss, on our website at Sealedair.com in the Investor Information section under Quarterly Results.", "This time, I will now turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "", "Thank you, Amanda and good morning to everyone. I am Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have David Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As an introduction, I will provide a few highlights of our business for the third quarter, and we will discuss our revised guidance. Dave will then review selected financial results. After Dave\u2019s remarks, we will take your questions. As you saw by our performance results released earlier today, we did experience a challenging third quarter. We faced expanding economic slowdowns globally that came largely at the end of the third quarter, and negatively impacted our unit volumes.", "Additionally, we experienced peak resin costs during the quarter. Combined, these factors place pressure on our results, and offset the increasing benefits of our ongoing price increases, our tight control of expenses and end of the quarter resin price reductions. These factors were the chief contributors to the decline in operating profit and in earnings per share for the quarter. Prior to the call, I did reach out to our business folks around the world, and have an update on what is happening around our business globally, and would be happy to provide that in comments at the end of our session.", "However during today\u2019s call, I would like to highlight key areas of our business performance for the quarter, both by market and by geography, and to outline key trends and factors that influenced our results, but did not impact our position in the marketplace.", "I would first like to start with what we did accomplish this quarter. We realized continuing benefits from our ongoing price increases with third quarter price increases in July and September, across many of our businesses and geographies. As I result, we were able to offset about 2/3 of the quarter\u2019s resin price increases, which as you noticed in the press release was roughly $52 million for the quarter. And more than half our resin cost increases for the first nine months of the year. We did implement our previously announced cost reduction and productivity program. We did maintain strong growth in key developing geographies.", "China sales grew by 17%, Russia 12% and Latin America excluding Brazil grew at 15%. We also continued to launch several new products and equipment systems. During the third quarter, we also completed our transition to our enterprise-wide SAP system, with our United States Food business rollout at the beginning of the third quarter.", "During the third quarter we continue to streamline the processes, and move up the learning curve with the new system. I do want to thank all of our employees not only in the US, but help from other parts of the world, who put in a lot of time and effort, in bringing up our new computer system. Although we are proud of these accomplishments, and we know they will yield long-term benefits for our business, they were not fully able to offset the fall in unit volume, due to deteriorating economic conditions, nor the decline we experienced in our gross margins, associated with the peak resin costs which occurred in the quarter. As a result, our third quarter diluted earnings of $0.5 per share, which includes the $0.22 per share charge, related to the cost reduction and productivity programs. Excluding this charge, and others listed in our press release, our third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.28.", "Let\u2019s look at our performance by business area. Our Food Packaging business results for the third quarter reported a 3% decline in volume. Let me point out that in our North American region, we are able to identify that approximately one week of orders were recognized in the second quarter, as customers pre-bought ahead of both the July 1, price increase, and ahead of our SAP system implementation, which also occurred on July 1.", "Looking at the region for the first nine months, which smooths this timing effect, North American volumes were positive, and track very closely to meat processing rates, and benefited from the expanding exports of US bone-in beef products to South Korea. Internationally, the Australian market was stable, as good spring conditions yielded comparable year-over-year cattle production and an increase in milk production.", "Our Latin American business saw double-digit growth in all countries except Venezuela and Brazil. Where Brazil continued to see a shortfall in unit volume, as cattle breeders pursued the much slower than expected certification process necessary to resume beef exports to Europe.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our North American volumes to track regional meat processing rates, which are expected to decline slightly in the period before an anticipated recovery in mid-2009. In Latin America, we expect ongoing growth in all areas except Brazil, which is expected to show continued declining volumes on a comparable basis, as beef exports to Europe are expected to remain slow for the balance of the year.", "In Food Solutions, our business remains solid in most regions of the world. Europe did weaken late in the quarter as the expanding economic challenges in Western Europe, and was flat for the quarter.", "In Europe, we did see some shift in consumer purchasing behavior that favored discount retailers, as a means to adapt to the deteriorating economic environment. As a result of lower consumption rates, we did see a small decline in unit volumes, particularly in the UK, that offset the rise in product price mix in that region, as saying leaving sales overall flat for the quarter. In this environment, we are staying focused on new and proprietary products and systems, like our new Case-Ready format, Mirabella, and Darfresh Bloom, as well as our Slice Pack solution and our new aseptic vertical pouch packaging system. All of these products deliver unique proprietary advantages of merchandising, distribution, and cost savings, very critical for our customers in these highly competitive and uncertain times.", "Within North America, unit volumes continue to show a slight year-over-year decline, due to the previously-announced change in packaging format at one large retailer, which occurred in November of 2007, as well as the same limited pre-buying in the second quarter, prior to our July 1, price increase and SAP system implementation.", "In Latin America, Food Solution sales increased over 25%, with positive growth in all countries driven by all product areas, from growth in pizza promotions to various cook and chill applications and continued ready meal adoptions. Case Ready sales continue to grow at double digit rates outside of North America, and vertical pouch packaging remains strong in all regions, except in Europe as I noted earlier. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect the demand for our Food Solutions products to generally track with third quarter results.", "Moving on to Protective Packaging segment, third quarter sales declined as North America and Europe economic conditions in the industrial sector continue to deteriorate in the quarter, especially in the month of September. Overall, North America and unit volume performance was in line with proxies, such as corrugated box shipments, and reflect the recent headlines expressing multi year lows in manufacturing output and retail sales. In the face of these challenges, we were still able to apply price increases that provided for a moderate growth and product price mix, and also helped to offset a large portion of the peak resin costs experienced in the quarter.", "We expect Protective Packaging for the balance of 2008, again to track third quarter performance due to ongoing weak economic conditions and our expectations for a more modest holiday season.", "And lastly, in our Other category, net sales increased solidly, with most regions experiencing double digit growth rates, driven largely by the addition of Alga Plastics in the medical business, and the acquisition of ETHAFOAM Products in Specialty Materials. As with our other business areas, product price mix increased due to the ongoing benefit of price increases applied throughout the year.", "I would like to take a minute to update you on our cost reduction and productivity program, and to discuss our revised full year 2008 guidance. Last quarter we announced our cost reduction and productivity program, and shared that goal with you on our second quarter conference call. We implemented that program, and expect to complete it by the end of 2008 with expected charges between $50 million and $60 million, largely related to severance costs.", "In the third quarter, we executed the cost reduction program, and did incur a $60 million charge related to the severance costs associated with at phased voluntary and targeted reduction programs. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur additional severance and other personnel and facility closure costs. We do expect that the personnel portion of the program will be fully implemented by the end of this year.", "As we look to 2009, we expect to continue to incur more modest costs, associated with the actual facility closures. We continue to anticipate annual savings from this program of approximately $50 million to $60 million, beginning in 2009.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we conservatively anticipate economic weakness globally, as well as continued uncertainty in the financial markets, and among consumers. As a result, we now expect our unit volumes to slightly decline in the fourth quarter and finish slightly down for the full year. Although we anticipate ongoing decreases in resin costs in the fourth quarter, we do not expect the benefits to fully offset volume weakness. We further expect that a stronger US dollar will negatively effect the translation of our international earnings in the fourth quarter. ", "As a result, we now expect our full year 2008 diluted earnings per share to be $0.35 to $0.45, compared to our previous announced range of $0.55 to $0.65. This range includes charges that were outlined in the press release today, as well as an approximate $25 million annual benefit from our global manufacturing strategy. The change in our guidance reflects these updated assumptions.", "First, we expect full year average raw material costs to be slightly lower than previously anticipated. And I will say that resin costs are a moving target right now. Declining unit volume and a stronger US dollar, which could negatively affect our earnings by as much as 5 to 6%, additionally, we are assuming a new lower full year effective tax rate of approximately 23.7%. Our expectations of operating expenses of approximately 16% or less have not changed.", "Looking ahead to 2009, we expect the declined savings from our ongoing global manufacturing strategy, our recently implemented cost reduction program, lower resin prices and continued positive price mix into next year to total in excess of $116 million in savings in 2009.", "Now I will turn the call over to Dave Kelsey, to review some additional details of our financial performance. Dave?", "David H. Kelsey - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned our sales were $1.219 billion for the quarter. For those participating in the call who would like additional detail, tables posted on our website, sealedair.com, present the components of change in net sales by business segment and by geography, the impact of foreign currency translation on sales by geographic region and the percentage of sales by geographic region.", "As you saw in our financial statements, gross profit decreased $26 million in the third quarter due primarily to resin costs which reached record highs in July before easing slightly in August and September. Overall, resin added $53 million to our cost of goods sold. The combination of favorable price and unfavorable product mix netted $27 million. The $26 million gap between resin costs and price mix recovery explains the year-over-year gross margin erosion. As an aside, with resin prices continuing to decline, we expect the gap between our resin cost and our price mix recovery to close appreciably in the fourth quarter.", "Marketing, administrative and development expenses were essentially flat in the quarter, when foreign exchange is excluded. Our cost containment efforts were implemented early in first quarter, as we assessed that economic conditions were likely to compare unfavorably to our initial outlook for 2008. We have been benefiting from those efforts throughout the year.", "Operating profit was $39 million, or 3.2% of revenue. Adding back restructuring and other charges of $61 million, increases operating profit to 8.2% of revenue. The decline of $34 million from the third quarter of 2007 is explained primarily by higher resin costs being only partly offset by price mix.", "Interest expense decreased $4 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily reflecting the April retirement of our 5.38% [ph] notes. In the third quarter we recorded an additional $4 million pretax charge, to recognize impairment related to a decline in the fair market value, of three of the five auction rate securities we hold. During the quarter, we concluded that the decline in value of these three securities, with a fair value of $20 million, was Other Than Temporary. The original cost of all five of our auction rate securities we hold was $25 million.", "Bill has already commented on our revised earnings per share guidance for 2008, so I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. As previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2008, we sold an undivided ownership interest in $135 million of receivables, under our existing Accounts Receivables securitization program. The proceeds were used to fund the retirement of a portion of our 5.38% notes, accordingly these receivables were removed from our balance sheet. Our Accounts Receivable declined $101 million from December 31, primarily reflecting this sale. Excluding the sale compared to September of last year, customers Receivable balances would increase $23 million or 3%, while our quarter-over-quarter sales increased $58 million or 5%.", "Inventory investment at September 30, declined $19 million during the quarter. This decline is attributable to a decrease in our inventory held outside of the US, primarily due to foreign exchange translation partially offset by higher investment in the US. Compared to September 30 of last year, inventory investment was up $32 million in line with revenue growth. Total borrowings at the end of September were $1.661 billion, unchanged from the end of June. The outstanding balance of $227 million, related to a debt issue maturing in May of 2009, is recorded in current liabilities as of September 30.", "Given the unsettled situation in the capital markets, it seems appropriate the comment on Sealed Air\u2019s liquidity position. We ended September with approximately $275 million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes the net book value of our investments and auction rate securities. Operating cash flow, one of our key metrics as a management team gets close attention. As I stated previously, our Accounts Receivable and inventory balances are in-line with our revenue growth with both investment levels and ageing within acceptable ranges.", "Capital investment will be lower in 2009, as work is completed on our three new plants in emerging markets. We currently expect 2009 capital spending to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million. Moving to the liability side of the balance sheet, in May of next year, we will have to retire $227 million of outstanding 6.95% senior notes, which could be accomplished using available cash and borrowings under our approximately $600 million of committed lines of credit.", "Lastly, in 2009, we will be prepared to fund approximately $700 million that represents the cash portion of the settlement we reached in 2002 in the W.R. Grace bankruptcy. The timing of any such payment remains uncertain, but we are prepared to use a combination of available cash, and either an expansion of our existing committed lines of credit, or a new medium term funding source. These borrowings to fund the settlement should come down, as we receive tax benefits related to the deductible nature of both the cash value and the common share value of the settlement.", "In conclusion, I would like to update you on our global manufacturing strategy. We now expect $60 million of capital investment in 2008, which will bring our cumulative capital investment from 2006 through 2008 to $133 million. This will largely complete the Greenfield construction of our strategy, within our projected range of $130 million to $150 million.", "In addition to our capital investment, we have previously estimated that other costs associated with expanding our global manufacturing base and establishing centers of excellence would be $30 million in 2008, in a total cost of $55 million well below our original range of $90 million to $100 million.", "In summary, consistent with our previous guidance, we are estimating that our benefit from these projects will be approximately $25 million in 2008, increasing $20 million to total benefits of $45 million in 2009, and increasing an additional $10 million to total benefits of $55 million in 2010. As previously noted the timing of our spending and benefits for our global manufacturing strategy, is subject to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the spending or benefits to occur in future periods.", "Now I will turn the call back over to Bill, and to your questions.", "William V. Hickey - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Dave. Operator, can we now open up the call and take questions from the participants?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much. [Operator instructions]. And we\u2019ll go first to George Staphos, Banc of America Securities.", "George Staphos", "Hi everyone. Good morning.", "William V. Hickey", "Hey, George.", "George Staphos", "Hey, may be a couple of quick questions, first on earnings and --", "William V. Hickey", "You are only allowed one, George.", "George Staphos", "I know you said one and a follow up, I understand that.  In terms of price catch up, at one point in and time you said you should be fully caught up on run rate basis by the fourth quarter, it sounds like now with your commentary that well directionally you are move in right way, you might not be fully caught up by the fourth quarter could you help us with a bit more color on that front? And then, in terms of the sequential change 3Q to 4Q we are effectively implying $0.40 or so I guess for the fourth quarter, what actually get better for you sequentially, is it purely spread, and I guess spread within the Food Packaging business? Thanks.", "William V. Hickey", "Sure George. Let me start to get to your first question. I think what we said is we were 75% -- or 70% or 75% recovered on resin by the end of the year and that a run rate in the fourth quarter that essentially got it all back. We\u2019re probably down a little bit from that but I will tell you it\u2019s a moving target even where we are today on resin that numbers probably more 65% for the year with a run rate that\u2019s probably slightly less than a 100% by the fourth quarter kind of 90%. But, on the other hand, I think we\u2019ve mentioned you earlier this year, that we are looking it somewhere around $190 million of higher resin cost in \u201808 than in \u201807. We\u2019re backing after those numbers almost weekly George and it\u2019s been kind of a moving target. So, that right now based on what we see carrying the numbers through where we are now to the end of the year and I will let experts more qualified and me project what is going to happen the resin for the of the year, but are 190s down by 165 million in 2008 over 2007. So, we\u2019ve recovered a fair amount based on changes have occurred in the marketplace since the end of September. The number could be less but at this point we are sort of honing in on the 165 number which would give us about a 65% recovery this year and about a 90% run rate by the end of the year. Okay. And now I went on so long, what was the second part of your question?", "George Staphos", "Well, fourth quarter is it basically spread within the food business, thanks?", "William V. Hickey", "Yeah, well the food business, I think we had a couple of things, one is I think that the third quarter -- I try to give a little bit of color there is one we did have a -- I believe a shift of about a weak source of business between second and third quarter. Our SAP go live had all the traditional startup issues that companies have and that probably adversely effected our service levels during the quarter. We also as you know, lost a -- or I shouldn\u2019t say -- I should say loss the right word, but one of our major retail customer shifted part of their case ready business to a different format and that lapses in the fourth quarter, George. So, your comparables become better. And then, third is we are going to see more price in the fourth quarter and food business in particular you should see widening of margins.", "", "George Staphos", "Thanks Bill.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Ghansham Panjabi, Wachovia.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Yes, good morning.", "William V. Hickey", "Ghansham, I was thinking of you when I said experts on resin. ", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Bill, could you talk about the volume trajectory comment? Give us a little more color there. Where exactly did you see a tail off in the third quarter? Which businesses and also which geographies? Thanks.", "William V. Hickey", "Well the principal business where volume slipped during the quarter was on the Protective side, as you know, which primarily serves the industrial markets. We do have relatively good sized percentage of the Protective business growing in the retail sector, and that actually was off a bit for the first time in a long time. And August is traditionally a slow month in our business. It just happens the way things are. July tends to reasonably busy in the food business, with summer barbecues, and September begins to pick up, with some of customers beginning to buy in for the holiday season. September\u2019s roughly a 21 day shipping month for us, and the way the calendar worked is actually two more days than last, year. So, we were expecting September to come in quite well, and particularly on the Protective side September slipped, and slipped probably more in Europe on the Protective side than it did in North America. The Food business, as I say, if I take the SAP numbers out, you are reasonably flat, and on the Food Solutions business, you have got the issue with a customer shift comparable to prior year.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Just as a follow-up question on the cost savings goal of $150 million plus in \u201809, is that a net number, and is that also a number to be realized in 2009 versus a run rate?", "William V Hickey", "", "Okay. If I do my math and I will let Dave answer it here. Got to add the GMS, the recent cost savings, plus our current look at resin savings. So, Dave, do you want to fill in the numbers for Ghansham?", "David H. Kelsey", "", "Yes, Ghansham, did you say $115 million?", "", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Yeah.", "David H. Kelsey", "", "Okay, that is 35 that I don\u2019t have to come up with. The cost reduction program we are expecting to have $60 million in savings next year. The incremental benefit from the global manufacturing strategy is another $20 million, that will get you to $80 million, and the balance then would be from resin.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Okay. Great, thanks so much.", "William V. Hickey", "And the resin number, Ghansham, as you know, they think it is still a moving target.", "Operator", "", "We will go next to Ross Gilardi of Merrill Lynch.", "Ross Gilardi", "", "Good morning, guys. Just had a couple of questions too. Could you just talk, generally about your confidence, your ability to sustain pricing power as your volumes are quite weak right now?", "William V. Hickey", "Well, let me say, Ross, we basically have announced all of the price increases we are going to announce, and the job we face is to maintain those, and we have traditionally done reasonably well at being sticky, as raw materials start to come down, and as much as they were slow on the way up, they are equally slow on the other side of the cycle, Ross, and even though demand is down, those customers that sort of need the products, the product protection that we provide, continue to buy it.", "Ross Gilardi", "", "Are you seeing any customers push for concessions already, yet?", "William V Hickey", "Actually it is interesting. We actually have customers saying can you find a way to bring our costs down, and the one thing that I keep trying to reinforce to our organization, and actually to you folks too, is that our price is not the same as a customer\u2019s costs. That our price should result in a lower cost to the customer and that is essentially how we go to market, and the main tool we use to hold onto pricing.", "Ross Gilardi", "Got you. And then, just quickly on your voluntary termination program. I am just curious what kind of people are taking the package, and specifically are you seeing any significant departures in your sales force?", "William V. Hickey", "No, actually the number of salespeople has been relatively low. It has tended to be people who are probably within a couple of years of retirement, were the most logical ones, and they seem to come out, and then the other part were just some people who thought they would like to try something new. And just to give you a little bit of flavor on the mix.", "Ross Gilardi", "", "Got you, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Claudia Hueston, JP Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston", "", "Thanks very much. Good morning.", "William V. Hickey", "", "Good morning.", "Claudia Hueston", "", "Just had a follow-up question to the answer you gave on the cost reduction program. As we think about the savings associated with the headcount reduction specifically, should we expect that sort of $60 million, those savings to come in pretty immediately in the first quarter of next year?", "William V. Hickey", "", "Yes, Claudia, they should. Everyone who has been affected by the program has been informed, or just about everyone has been informed, and we will wrap it up by the end of the year, and the costs should begin to flow through in the first quarter. Yes.", "Claudia Hueston", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, obviously you have got the cost savings coming through, and I know you talked at your Investor Day, about 15% to 20% earnings growth. Obviously the markets have changed a lot in a couple of weeks, but are you still pretty comfortable with that sort of earnings growth next year?", "William V. Hickey", "Claudia, my crystal ball isn\u2019t as good as I would like it to be. But we were looking at 15% off of a higher number. And, Dave and I chatted before the call, and we opted to go with the savings of 115, as you can do the math on the EPS effect. Unless there is a dramatic further downturn in the economy, I would say that number is reasonable, if there is an upturn in the economy we should probably do better.", "Claudia Hueston", "Okay. Thank you, very much.", "Operator", "", "We will go next to Richard Skidmore, Goldman Sachs", "Richard Skidmore", "", "I would like to follow-up on the pricing question, and just to clarify, you mentioned the resin would be 65% recovered for the year, and slightly less than 100% in the fourth quarter, and prior you had thought it would be 75, and sort of full. With resin coming down does that imply that your pricing efforts hadn\u2019t materialized as you had anticipated, or that you have seen less pricing?", "William V. Hickey", "I think you\u2019ve got a little bit -- you got two factors going into that. The first is that with the shortfall in volume there is less price to get back, okay. I mean that is just the way the math works is that you are selling fewer products. So, that your contribution on that incremental higher selling price goes away. And, the second is in mix is, as I mentioned during some comments earlier is that you are seeing somewhat of a shift to the discount side of the marketplace. So that for example, one customer who packages products that they usually don\u2019t want to leak, are actually looking at a lower cost bag, that could result in some leaky product. Because they feel they have got to find a way to bring their own costs down. So, it is a combination of the effect of the volume, as well as effect of the mix.", "Richard Skidmore", "Okay. And then just to follow-up on the pricing, you would expect on your announced prices to see the full benefit in the fourth quarter, or in the first part of 2009?", "William V. Hickey", "I am not sure I understand. I think we said that by the fourth quarter, our run rate would be somewhat less than 100% we had expected back in July. There are still price increments to roll through, so I would estimate and I haven\u2019t done the numbers yet, is that the rest of the pickup would probably come in the first quarter.", "Richard Skidmore", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "We will go next to Robert Trout, Goldman Sachs", "Robert Trout", "", "Hey. Good morning, guys. I am wondering if you could help us think about sort of worst case scenario for volumes on the Food Packaging side, because if I look at the 2% decline in this quarter, that looks to be as bad as it has ever been, at least in the last decade or so, and without the whole SAP issue if you take that out, volumes probably would have been flat year-over-year. I am wondering if there is a good corollary that we can look at what, historically the worst this business has been from a volume standpoint?", "William V. Hickey", "I am not sure I have all of that readily at hand, but if you saw, had done some work and see in the 3% number, I don\u2019t have a good surrogate, because the business covers all forms of protein. It covers all parts of the world. So I am not sure there is one surrogate that works, but if you really look at the 2001 to 2006 period, your 3% is probably as weak as it has gotten. And that is for a quarter. I am looking at whole years. If you look at full years, if you look at full years, from 2001 on the lowest it has essentially gone is 0.7%, on an annual basis.", "", "Robert Trout", "Okay. Okay, thank you. Then, just a quick follow-up on the resin outlook for next year. I know you mentioned it is a moving target, but if you take at 100 and you back off the $60 million for cost reduction, and the $20 million for incremental global manufacturing savings, the balance is about 35, and if I understand your cost picture correctly, if resin is about 40 to 45% of your total cost of goods sold, and you think will be about $35 million lower year-over-year, that is probably only, it seems like the underlying expectation for resin pricing next year is that it is only down about a couple of percent, is that right?", "William V. Hickey", "Well, as I said earlier, we are using at this point, rather than try to speculate on your part what resin is, is we are looking at our fourth quarter resin numbers as a reasonable basis to project 2009. I don\u2019t feel qualified to tell you what I think it could go to, but we are basing our numbers on fourth quarter.", "Robert Trout", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will go to a follow-up from George Staphos, Banc of America Securities. ", "George Staphos", "", "Thanks Quick question, Bill, back to liquidity, if we look to next year, is the fair analysis that basically your cash from operations, and your existing revolver, I think you said is $600, million, should allow you to deal with both the one maturity you have coming up, as ,well as potentially the Grace settlement. Would that be fair?", "William V. Hickey", "George, when the two of those together would be in the $950 million. And, since we do like to have a cash cushion on hand, to keep the wheels greased globally, we would anticipate going out, either to our existing bank group, which is still standing and increase the size of that facility or to do a smallish facility with a medium term tenure with a different funding source. So, right now, I would say we would expect to cover two-thirds to three-quarters within our existing cash balances, and liquidity or borrowing capability, and then look to raise $250 million to through other vehicles.", "George Staphos", "As far as timing on that would go, do you have any sense, or I am not sure that you could be in a position?", "David H. Kelsey", "I have a perfect answer on the notes. That $227 million will be in May of next year. I guarantee that. On the Grace settlement, you have been with us for a while we have always said it is a year or more away. I think at this point I can say it is within a year. I don\u2019t think things are likely to move so quickly it is going to be a first quarter event, but second quarter is certainly a possibility, and we will be prepared in the second quarter.", "George Staphos", "Okay thanks, I will turn it over.", "William V. Hickey", "", "Okay, George, operator, let me just take a couple of questions from the Internet here quickly, and a lot of them revolve around what Dave just said, so I will let Dave address it. The comments, the questions from three different people, are one, given you have got a maturity in May of 2009 the fund and requirement for Grace, do we expect any changes in our plan to return value to shareholders? The other is how much do we have left under our Board authorization to buy shares? And can we comment given the current credit crunch on liquidity, to finance the asbestos shares. I think Dave addressed a lot of that, but if you just want to tie that all together, Dave?", "David H. Kelsey", "Yes, see if I can pull those down. In terms of share repurchases, first of all, we don\u2019t announce ahead of time our intention to repurchase shares. Right now, we have a fairly significant amount still available under Board authorization, something on the order of 16 million shares that we can repurchase. In terms of the liquidity questions, I think in my comments to George those were addressed, in terms of the sources of funds, the timing of payment, we are very confident in our ability to be able to fund those when the time arises. In terms, I guess there has been a question about the tax, the timing of the tax attributes associated with the settlement payment. On the assumption that the settlement does get funded in 2009, we would take that into consideration in making our estimated tax payments in 2009. So that would help us avoid something on the order of $40 to $50 million of cash tax payments. When we filed the return, we would expect to recover an additional amount probably in the order of $100 million in mid 2010. And then on a going forward basis, we would have built up, technically an NOL, but it works that way that would offset future taxes in the US on the order of $40 to $50 million a year and that would run out into most likely 2014. That would be governed in part by the taxable income that we generate in the US over that period. So, it\u2019s a fairly significant amount that we would ultimately avoid in cash tax payments. A chunk coming in the 2010, period, and then a tail on it out 3 or 4 years into the future.", "William V Hickey", "", "Okay, thanks, Dave. I have got just two more internet questions, before I go back to the telephone operator. One was, it was on the same basis of the 15% to 20% EPS growth in 2009, I think I covered that in my earlier comments, and as you heard the discussion in one or two questions ago, is if you take the $115 million, in excess of $115 million savings next year, with 60 and 20 with the GMS and cost savings, it leaves you 35 plus on resin, and as I say, absent changes, in the dramatic changes either up or down, that number still seems reasonable. Other question was, is there a way to print the slides before the conference call. I believe the person is referring to the charts on the internet, and I really don\u2019t know, but if you want to check with Amanda, she might be able to help you. Operator, can we go back to next call on the telephone?", "Operator", "Yes, we will go next to Tim Thein, Citigroup.", "Tim Thein", "Thank you. First question Bill, on the last question, on the 15% to 20% EPS growth. Would that imply, I know there\u2019s a ton moving parts here, but would you need any, run rate in terms of economic growth globally that you are seeing now. Would you need to see any improvement from what you see now, in terms of getting to that number, or could you hit that based on what where we are at now?", "William V. Hickey", "I think I will go back to my 115 plus number as savings. Again absent things getting dramatically worse or dramatically better.", "Tim Thein", "Okay. And a lot of talk on your liquidity. What about, are you seeing any impact, there is pretty stretch liquidity. I think they are your customers; some of the big fresh protein manufacturers have hit some difficult straits. Have you seen any difference in terms of ordering patterns or payment terms, from some of the more of the stretched food companies out there?", "William V. Hickey", "On payment terms, we have had for some time, a very effective global organization that tracks our agings and payment terms, gets involved early on with our sales force when issues arise. So, they are clearly very alert right now, but we have not seen market erosion in performance. And there is a recent comment by one large producer, that they have a significant cash balance, that they are looking to spend on consolidation. So, there are clearly firms out there, that are going to be more impacted than others, but in general, I think we are comfortable with our exposure.", "We did actually though increase our reserve for receivables in quarter, just to be sure that we were covered on the particular issue which you have raised. So, we have booked an additional provision in the third quarter numbers, in the range of $2 to $4 million.", "Tim Thein", "", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "William V. Hickey", "There is a question on the internet, asking if we were intending to sell our auction rate securities prior to year-end? The answer, the short answer is no. We think that it is in our best interest to hold those, until a more formal market reopens. There is no pressing need for us to liquefy those positions. Meantime, they all are paying interest currently, and we will continue to look at the mark-to-market requirements a quarterly basis. ", "David H. Kelsey", "The other comment the individual on the internet said, is there are some companies, or say some of the brokerage firms have announced settlements where they are buying auction rate securities, but those are really for individuals and for companies with, I think less than 10, or less than $100 million in sales. We really don\u2019t qualify under those settlement agreements, but we do follow them. I ask our Treasurer about how we are doing with the major bankers. ", "William V. Hickey", "We have time for one more question and operator, I think we have one on the telephone.", "", "Operator", "George Staphos, please go ahead ", "George Staphos", "Thanks, guys. Very quickly what gives you confidence, I realize there are lots of moving parts in terms of the outlook, but what gives you confidence that food volume should recover, if I heard you right, by the second of half of next year? Obviously you have got herd liquidations occurring this year, which has helped the production, but could hurt demand next year. And then, the question always comes up, can you if you need to, Dave, bring in that CapEx number to a lower level, would it risk the ongoing activity you have with any of your initiatives and your programs for next year? Thanks. Good luck in the quarter.", "William V. Hickey", "Let me comment on the food number for next year. I have got a degree of confidence, and I am comfortable because the confidence is in a variety of pockets. One is, as you said herd sizes shrinking, will come back around mid next year. So you have got the sort of herd-size demographics going in our favor. Second, I do think the Brazilian beef export issue will finally resolve itself, I really do. The third is that the Chinese hog issue is getting better, and the Chinese food numbers. We didn\u2019t talk a lot about it but one of the weak spots, despite the growth we are seeing in China in all parts of our business, is the fresh pork is really very slow right now, and is actually down from last year, because you have heard us refer to the hog disease that China has been having, and then the US exports will get better. The Korean market is opening, and will pick up. The combination of Brazil, US, Asia give me a good feeling that the Food business will have a better 2009 than 2008. As far as CapEx, Dave gave you the 125 to 150, I think that has been our kind of normal number, but we have talked internally, that if we don\u2019t see growth in the markets given the build out we have done. Remember, we put in three plants this year, and we have incurred the cost of those three plants, and George, you mentioned that a number of times on your own questions. And, we are clearly running at less than capacity in our new plant startups, so yes, we could wind that number back further.", "David H. Kelsey", "", "Just to put some history on that, George, I think in the past half dozen years, we have gone as low as $100 million, and that was not based on any top down decision that Bill or I made, to constrain capital investment. It is simply in a period of time when we have ample capacity in place, repair and maintenance tends to run at that level, and maybe below that level.", "George Staphos", "", "And in a period where volumes were probably biased to the downside and not the upside, from a macro standpoint that is talking about Sealed Air, and given everything that you have done with global manufacturing, it would seem that perhaps there is probably room to take the CapEx down below trend line over time, but we will watch.", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, and I think if you look at by the time the clock turns on 2008, we will have started up one, two, three, four plants in the last 12 to 18 months, and they are just looking for business, George. They are looking for business.", "George Staphos", "", "I hope they find it.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. I want to thank everyone for participating in the call. Certainly this was a difficult quarter, but I do think we still have the things going in our favor. We have implemented our plans and our initiatives are in place, and I hope we have been able to convey that we do remain confident that the actions we are taking and the plans we have, will better position Sealed Air for the future. We still have a solid financial profile. We do have the leading brand and product portfolios and we have an unparalleled geographic footprint around the world. So, I think that positions us to leverage market opportunities, drive value for our customers, value for our shareholders, and value for our employees. So, I look out to the future excited about our prospects, comfortable and confident with our competitive position, and feel really good about the underlying growth drivers that offer tremendous opportunity. And, for these and all of the reasons I say every quarter, I am still happy and proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder. So, thank you, very much.", "Operator", "", "And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on to form 10-K or quarterly report on form 10-Q.", "We have also posted supplemental financial information and reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures that we expect to discuss on our website at sealedair.com in the investor information section under quarterly results. At this time, I will turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO.", "William Hickey ", "Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. I am Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have Dave Kelsey our Chief Financial Officer. As an introduction, I will provide a few highlights of our business for the fourth quarter and full year 2008 as well as discuss our 2009 guidance. Dave will then review select details of our financial results. After Dave\u2019s remarks, we will take your questions.", "2008 was clearly a challenging and unpredictable year. Despite the volatility in commodity prices, weakening economic conditions, shifting buyer behavior, and de-stocking among industrial customers, we finished the year with earnings within our updated guidance and also continued to generate cash.", "By the fourth quarter, our margins reflected the benefits of the proactive actions we took earlier in the year to counter the challenges we tried to anticipate. These actions included our pricing initiatives, which we held through the fourth quarter and allowed us to recover approximately 95% of our incremental resin costs for the year, but they also included our cost savings programs and our expanded focus on operational efficiency.", "Here we completed our transition to the SAP enterprise system worldwide. We completed a three-year construction phase of our global manufacturing strategy. We applied stringent cost controls that reduced our full year operating expense ratio, and we implemented a broader cost reduction and productivity program in the third quarter. ", "Despite these positive actions, unit volume sales declined as economic conditions weakened through the end of the year. With the greatest decline occurring in the fourth quarter and largely within our North American Protective Packaging business. This decline was due to lower manufacturing and retail activity as well as inventory de-stocking, not a shift in our market position.", "Overall, our 3% increase in product price mix or $120 million of incremental revenue drove the majority of our revenue growth in both the full year and the fourth quarter. This price mix growth was primarily in our food business in the Americas and in Europe. Looking at the business geographically for the full year 2008, if we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, all regions posted positive revenue growth and in developing regions we achieved double-digit revenue growth in Russia 13%, China 14%, and 9% growth in Latin America, excluding Brazil.", "As economic conditions weakened late in the year, the growth rate slowed and by the fourth quarter, we saw flat year-over-year growth in North America and slight year-over-year decline in Europe and Latin America.", "Moving onto EPS, in the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.39 excluding the special items mentioned in our press release earlier this morning. For the full year, our diluted earnings per share were $1.40, again excluding the charges mentioned earlier which was within our October outlook. Looking at performance by business area, our food packaging business finished the year with positive revenue growth excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange.", "Within the fourth quarter, unit volume growth rates declined to negative 3% driven largely by reduced processing rates in Brazil. Our North American volumes declined by 1% in the quarter, which was slightly better than the regional meat processing rates, which also declined in the quarter reflecting the strength of our own applications and positions in the market.", "On a bright note, the business saw solid equipment placements worldwide through the fourth quarter as customers showed strong demand for automation and improved sanitation in their processes. As an example, we started our biggest equipment installation in Eastern Europe, which will yield volume growth over the next five years, and we are in the process of signing an equipment agreement with one of the largest meat processors in Europe.", "Also, the business continued to manage pricing through the fourth quarter as seen by the $60 million in price mix we generated for the full year. This largely reflected price mix growth in North and South America. Additionally, we saw benefit as the business strategically pruned products and accounts to protect margins and manage regional currency devaluations.", "Looking ahead to the first half of 2009, we anticipate North American volumes to track meat processing rates, which are expected to decline slightly in the period before an anticipated mild recovery in mid-2009.", "In Latin America, we anticipate growth in all areas except Brazil. Although the majority of Brazilian cattle breeders have now complied with European trade regulations, European demand has now slumped due to economic conditions in that region.", "And finally, in Australia we expect a flat to slight decrease in volume growth for the year based on their estimated processing rates. Moving onto food solutions, the business remained relatively solid through the year in all regions excluding Europe and the North American volume decline, which was related to one retailer who switched their packaging format in late 2007.", "In fact, the business showed strength through the fourth quarter across all products in the United States in Case-Ready in Australia and even the Pizza segment in Europe. Additionally, product price mix was positive for the full year contributing $30 million primarily from North America and showed exceptional strength in the fourth quarter reflective of the various pricing initiatives and strategic product and customer pruning applied through the year.", "In the United States, we\u2019re continuing to see more meat move to Case-Ready rather than back of the store for packaging due to the cost savings opportunities that Case-Ready offers. Additionally, in this economic environment, the demand for ground meats increases and this meat category is largely packaged in Case-Ready format.", "These trends combine with ongoing product development and successful regional launches of new formats like Mirabella, increased Case-Ready\u2019s full year revenue to approximately $480 million.", "Additionally, as consumers choose to eat at home and quick-service restaurants in this recessionary period, demand for vertical pouch packaging solutions has benefited. Revenues have grown at a double-digit rate of over 13% to $145 million for the full year 2008.", "The weakness we experienced in food solutions occurred late in the third and fourth quarter and was largely in Southern Europe. Here, revenue was unfavorably impacted by a decline in fresh red meat consumption and consumer buying trends shifted to discount retailers who have limited use of Case-Ready formats.", "Additionally, we saw a slowdown in our growth rates in developing regions of the world as recessionary conditions spread and customer\u2019s access to credit slowed new customer adoptions. Anticipating 2009 trends is challenging in this segment, as consumer buying behavior has been unpredictable and has created caution among our customers. Nonetheless, we\u2019re anticipating business trends to be solid in North America and Australia based on current processing conditions and our position within these regional markets.", "In these regions, we anticipate moderate growth in our ready meals, Case-Ready, and new tray, display tray formats in the year ahead and expect potential for flat to slight decline in equipment placements as customers conserve cash in the near term.", "Moving onto the Protective Packaging segment, this segment reflects the sharp downturn in economic conditions. Revenues slowed considerably in the fourth quarter across all product lines and geographies, as unit volumes declined due to customers reducing their manufacturing output, experiencing lower retail activity, or aggressively reducing their inventory.", "The business was successful with managing price for the end of the year, and we strategically managed volume loss from more price sensitive accounts. This resulted in $21 million of product price mix for the full year with approximately a little over half of that from North America.", "The first half of 2009 is anticipated to be challenging in this segment, as a result of market conditions. Our North America region [investment] and equipment demand will be relatively stable. However, we do anticipate a year-over-year decline in unit volumes of our packaging materials. Lastly, our other category finished the year with double-digit growth in both specialty materials and the medical applications business primarily attributable to our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of 2007.", "Looking at the fourth quarter of 2008, however, unit volume growth declined significantly in our specialty materials business, as demand was unfavorably impacted by economic conditions most notably in Europe and North America. This volume decline in the quarter was partially offset by strong double-digit product price mix growth in those same regions, as well as a 6% volume growth in our medical applications business, which still saw areas of strength despite some slowing in Asia due to regional economic weakness.", "One additional item I would like to mention received a commitment for a total of $300 million of senior notes in a private placement. As you know, the regular credit markets have essentially been closed for all but a few borrowers with no clear sign as to when conditions will improve.", "Based on our financial obligations over the next year, we considered it prudent to provide financing for these obligations earlier and to provide certainty to the availability of funds in the event that traditional financial markets continue to be closed to most borrowers. ", "Before I hand it over to Dave, I would like to touch upon 2009 and our guidance. We would like to believe that 2008 was our most challenging year. However, as I\u2019ve already mentioned, we remain cautious about the recessionary conditions and unpredictable demand that we expect to face in the year ahead, at least through the first half of 2009.", "As a result, we expect our full year 2009 diluted earnings per common share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.37, which includes charges of $20 million net of taxes or $0.08 per share expected to be incurred related to our global manufacturing strategy. Excluding these charges, we expect our 2009 earnings to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.45 per common share, which includes the incremental expense on the $300 million financing commitment that I mentioned earlier.", "Looking at our guidance in more detail, we have assumed that our full year average raw material costs will decrease compared with 2008 and we expect it to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half.", "As a basis for resin price assumptions, we assume the full year average price of oil at $57, and we are anticipating oil prices to be above that average in the second half of the year.", "We have also assumed a low single-digit percent decline in our unit volume growth rates in 2009, which is in line with our expectations for trends and customer demand. We have also assumed ongoing positive product price mix as we continue to manage costs recovery and return to a consolidated 30% gross margin over time.", "We have estimated operating expenses of approximately 16% or less of sales and a full year effective tax rate of 27.7%. Our capital expenditures range is now $100 million to $125 million. As for foreign exchange, we have assumed a stronger U.S. dollar will reduce the revenue and earnings contribution of our international operations. We\u2019re estimating a full year average U.S. dollar to euro foreign exchange rate of $1.29 versus an average of $1.47 for the full year 2008.", "During our third quarter earnings call, we discussed our expectation of generating $115 million of benefit in 2009 from a combination of benefits from our cost reduction and productivity program, our global manufacturing strategy, lower resin prices, and favorable price mix.", "We expect to generate those benefits in 2009, despite being substantially offset by unit volume declines and unfavorable foreign exchange. These benefits will enable us to hold and potentially improve our earnings in the face of another challenging year and certainly, if conditions continue to deteriorate, we have contingencies in place to respond. ", "As a result, we are anticipating 2009 conditions to remain challenging and we remain cautious, but we will continue to manage our business for continued margin recovery that we expect from our ongoing cost control measures, favorable product price mix, supply chain initiatives, and we will focus on continued cash flow generation.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and liquidity position.", "David Kelsey", "As Bill mentioned, our sales were $11,168,000,000 for the quarter. For those participating in the call who would like additional details, tables posted on our website sealedair.com present the components of the change in net sales by business segment and by geography, the impact of foreign currency translation on sales, by geographic region and the percentage of sales by geographic region.", "As you saw in our financial statements, gross profit decreased $36 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Our lower sales volume, particularly in the Protective Packaging segment was the primary contributing factor. A second factor responsible for approximately one-third of the decrease was foreign currency translation.", "Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased $25 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Approximately one-third of the decrease was attributable to foreign currency translation. Lower accruals from incentive compensation, lower travel expense, and some initial savings from our cost reduction and productivity program also contributed to the year-over-year decrease in spending.", "Bad debt expense, which gets recorded in this section was approximately $5 million for the quarter, higher than in prior periods, but still manageable. Operating profit was $114 million or 9.8% of revenue, adding back restructuring and other charges of $21 million increases operating profit to 11.6% of revenue. The decline of $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2007 is explained primarily by lower unit sales volumes in our Protective Packaging segment.", "Interest expense decreased $3 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily reflecting the April retirement of our 5 and 3/8% notes. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an additional $20 million pre-tax charge to recognize the impairment related to a decline in the fair market value of all five option rate securities we hold. Three of the five option rate securities are directly or indirectly impacted by the credit worthiness of Ambac and accounted for the majority of the impairment. Our current net book value is $11 million compared to our original cost of $45 million.", "I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Our accounts receivable declined $107 million from December 31, 2007, primarily reflecting the sale of $80 million of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization facility. Excluding this sale, compared to December of last year, customer receivables balances would have decreased $27 million or 3%. On a constant dollar basis, after adding back the impact of the sale of receivables, accounts receivable would have increased approximately 4% compared to December of last year.", "We consider ourselves to be well prepared to manage our receivables balances in the current economic climate. Over the past two years, we have strengthened our organization, and we consider our current customer credit metrics to be within historic parameters.", "Inventory investment at December 31st declined to $71 million during the quarter. This decline is attributable to a decrease in inventory held outside the United States primarily due to foreign currency translation. Further contributing to the decline since the start of the fourth quarter has been a successful effort to reduce inventories in the United States, food segments, subsequent to the July 1st go-live of SAP in those businesses. Compared to December 31st of last year, inventory investment was down $17 million but up $24 million after adjusting for foreign currency translation.", "Total borrowings including the funds received from the sale of securities at December 31st were $1,559,000,000 billion down $237 million from the end of September or $182 million after adjusting for the sale of receivables in both periods.", "In April, we retired $300 million of 5 and 3/8% notes when they matured in. In December, we retired $91 million of 6.95% notes due May 15, 2009 as a result of our tender offer. We expect to retire the remaining 6.95% notes when they come due in May using available cash.", "Given the unsettled situation in the credit markets, it seems appropriate to comment on Sealed Air\u2019s liquidity position. We have access to over $600 million of committed borrowing capacity. We ended December with approximately $129 million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes the net book value of our investments in auction rate securities.", "Operating cash flow, one of our key metrics as a management team gets close attention. As I stated previously, our accounts receivable in inventory investment levels are within historic ranges. Capital investment will be lower in 2009 as work is completed on our three new plants in emerging markets.", "As Bill already commented, we currently expect 2009 capital spending to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million. This will return capital investment to the levels that we made annually in the earlier part of this decade. Prior to commencing investments for our global manufacturing strategy and represent a combination of maintenance and growth projects.", "Our cash flow projections suggests that we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations and the Grace settlement should have become payable later this year. However, as Bill mentioned, we nonetheless have opted to raise $300 million in a private placement of five-year notes that while adding to our interest expense will provide added flexibility to address our future funding needs in an uncertain time for global Capital Markets. Now, I will turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William Hickey", "Thank you, Dave. Operator, we would now like to open up the call to any questions from the participants.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first questions comes from Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Capital. ", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Capital ", "In terms of your volume assumptions for \u201809, looking at \u201808 looks like volumes were down a couple percent, but the fourth quarter was down 7%. Why is it realistic to assume volumes will be down low single digits in 2009 when the global economy seems to be getting worse, not better?", "William Hickey", "Well, Ghansham, we sort of have taken two shots, maybe three shots at our budget and we\u2019ve essentially brought some of the numbers down earlier to where we are now. Our assumption on low single-digit declines in 2009 are based on continued slowing through the first half of \u201809 with a gradual but tepid recovery beginning in the second half of \u201809. ", "Looking at the volume for the fourth quarter, I think I mentioned it twice during my prepared comments, and Dave may have covered just briefly is that, we have sensed fair amount of de-stocking on the part of customers as they\u2019ve reduced their inventories.", "We\u2019ve actually seen inventory replacements at some of our customers not dramatically, but clearly the channel had gotten very low on inventory as they ended 2008.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Wachovia Capital ", "Okay. And just as a follow-up question, looking at your U.S. business versus the international business and just the phase of the business cycle if you will, where do you think we are internationally including Europe, but referring more specifically to Asia-Pacific and Latin America?", "William Hickey", "I will give you sort of the quick summary is that the U.S. is still declining. In Europe, I actually bifurcate England and the rest of Europe. England, I actually think is sliding faster than the U.S. Europe is catching up to the U.S. pretty quickly, pretty dramatically.", "In Asia, you are seeing spill over from the U.S. You\u2019re seeing spill over in Latin America. The numbers for the year in both China and Latin America as you heard me say except for Brazil and Latin America were still up, and their numbers through the fourth quarter were still positive, but not by much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos - Banc of America Securities.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "I just wanted to piggyback on Ghansham\u2019s question regarding volume trends. What assumption do you have built into North American red meat consumption for 2009, Bill? It would seem from some of the data we have seen that there is a bit of a slowing here and with the consumer perhaps pinched more than they were even in 2008 that we might see something worse than a low single-digit decline within red meat within North America as a follow-on?", "William Hickey", "George, the projections for the first part of \u201809 are looking at slaughter down depending on who you look at. I have seen numbers 1%, 3%, down 5% for the first half of 2009, flattening and maybe a slight up tick in the latter half of \u201809. Pretty much the same with in terms of pork we saw pork flat in \u201809 versus \u201808, so you got to remember our mix is not just beef. You got the pork component and you\u2019ve got the poultry component, and our food business represents the composite of all three of those, but if I look at the mix, the beef will be down more, pork will be more flat, and probably poultry will be pretty close to flat. So that\u2019s sort of how we get to the food numbers, George, for \u201809.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "Okay. And as far as we\u2019ll call it the Berkshire notes go, do you have an ability to prepay those notes early should you find that ultimately you didn\u2019t need the capital for whatever reason, and is the operating assumption that the convertible notes for 2010 that you won\u2019t get any further financing because your operating cash flow will be able to handle that? ", "William Hickey", "I will ask Dave to take that one, George.", "David Kelsey", "George, the notes have a five-year term to them, and there is no ability to prepay them. So, we are entering into a five-year agreement with the lenders. Regarding the outlook sort of into the dark depths of our crystal ball in June of 2010, we think that with this $300 million borrowing that we have a reasonable liquidity projection both from operations and borrowing sources to address that when it comes to, but there are a number of other options as well that we\u2019re currently working on and we\u2019ll continue to work on for the balance of this year to make sure that liquidity, which is not an issue for us today does not become an issue for us in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "Could you give us a little more detail on the positive price mix in both categories and is it more price? Is it more mix? Is it bit of more or less balance version of both of them, and then as a follow-up, how confident are you that you will be able to hold onto the price increases and will not have to give them up in 2009, particularly as your raw material costs starts coming down?", "William Hickey", "Rosemary, let me go back and say that most of the price mix is price consistent with the comments we have made on our last couple of quarterly calls that we have been raising prices to offset and to try to get ahead of the volatile increases we saw in resin prices in 2008.", "We expect to retain most of those price increases. If you look at the pattern Sealed Air has over various other cycles, there is a [catch up] on the upside, and the recovery on the downside essentially the results in margin expansion, which we are beginning to see now.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "Regardless of what happens to the volume you still expect your operating margin to improve \u201809 versus \u201808?", "William Hickey", "I think if you do the numbers in my guidance for the year, you will reach a similar conclusion.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "Even at the $1.25?", "William Hickey", "Yeah. I am not going to go granular on the range, Rosemary. You will have to do that yourself.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs ", "Just to follow-up a little bit on the 2009 guidance a little bit versus 2008. Just trying to bridge between the two \u201808 to \u201809 and just to make sure I understood correctly, it sounds like you have 50 to 60 million of cost saves and benefit from GMS offset by currency, and you\u2019re going to benefit from price and mix. Is the negative delta then just primarily related to volume and the volume impact is going to be something like $50 million or $60 million negative in 2009?", "William Hickey", "You have done a good job. The biggest impact is probably FX. If you look at the range in foreign exchange, I think in our guidance in the press release we used $300 million to $400 million impact on the top line, and the remainder is volume, and of course the FX is just our assumption now. I am not willing to tell you what the euro will actually be at the end of \u201808-\u201909.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan", "I thought the result in food solutions was a little bit better than I expected, the operating margin in particular was a lot stronger than we had forecasted, and I wondered if you could just talk a little about what drove that and how sustainable you think this kind of operating margin is?", "William Hickey", "Yeah Claudia on just food solutions. That\u2019s a business that primarily focuses on away from home eating, it is sort of our away from home version, and I think what the business has done is focus on QSRs, focus on ready meals, and it really has had some good improvement in Case-Ready, which is also part of that business. I didn\u2019t mention a number exactly, but despite the loss of over $50 million in volume at one retailer in 2007, we did end up positive in case ready at 7.4%.", "As that business reduces its dependence on outsourced trays, which has been a factor in that business. If you recall, several hundred million dollars of the volume in food solutions is outsourced products on which we obtain only a small margin. As we leverage the rest of the business, primarily manufactured products, we should continue to see stability and perhaps improvement over the longer term in food solutions margins.", "Claudia Hueston - J.P. Morgan ", "That\u2019s very helpful. A quick question on the protective side of the business. I just wondered if you could comment a little bit about demand trends over the course of the fourth quarter and if you have any information just on the first couple of weeks of January. Are things getting materially worse in that business, particularly North America or is it sort of stabilized?", "William Hickey", "Let me sort of go and say that fourth quarter was sort of up down, and up kind of thing. You could tell by watching the channel that customers were carefully managing their inventory. The one thing which we typically see in holiday seasons is you will see a re-buy, generally you will get a re-buy between the fifth and the tenth of December for those that didn\u2019t buy enough material for their holiday packing and holiday shipping. There is a one last look, particularly for the online retailers. That didn\u2019t happen this year. That didn\u2019t happen, so the normal pick-up in December consistent happen, but we saw continued inventory shrinking. I\u2019d rather not comment on the first week in January yet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Reik Read - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Reik Read - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "I wanted to see if you guys could comment a little bit more on the operating expense side of things. When I look at things sequentially, revenue was down a little bit, but the operating expenses exceeded that pretty nicely. Can you talk about how much of that was one-time in nature, i.e. just good cost discipline in a difficult environment, and how much of that is sustainable based on the things that you have been doing?", "David Kelsey", "As Bill mentioned, we are expecting for the total year 2009 that expenses will be no greater than 16%, so it is not expected that we\u2019re going to sustain the fourth quarter spending levels as a percent of revenue of below 15%. We are starting to see some benefit in the fourth quarter from the cost reduction program that we announced back in July.", "We also had some benefit from foreign exchange as we translate the expenses of our overseas operations back into U.S. dollars, and then we had other savings that we have put into the belt-tightening category, particularly as it relates to travel and meetings and we would expect those to be sustainable into the New Year. So, I wouldn\u2019t say there are any big one-time charges with the one exception of annual incentive compensation, we tend to true that up as we go through the year, and given the fall-off in the performance of the business in the second half, we did reduce our accruals in the second half of the year, so that did have some impact on the fourth quarter expenses.", "Reik Read - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay. And then, Dave, can you just comment on what you think as you get into the 2009 timeframe, expectations for working capital?", "David Kelsey", "As I mentioned in my comments, the inventory and receivables balances we think have tracked well with the performance of the business. We don\u2019t see any adverse performance developing in those areas. As foreign currency has an impact there, something in the order of $300 million or $400 million potentially on our top line, that will get reflected in the reported balances of inventory and receivables on our books, but it is tough for me to say that translates into cash flow, because it is just a translation impact.", "The cash flow from operations, we think as a percent of sales will continue to track well. We have reduced costs as Bill mentioned. We expect margins to continue to be respectable in 2009, so no big issues in terms of the company being able to continue to live up to its reputation as a reliable generator of cash in good times and bad.", "Reik Read - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "And would you expect the first half though to be a little bit more positive just given the slowing you\u2019re talking about in terms of cash flow from working capital?", "David Kelsey", "Certainly on the working capital side we would expect impact in the first half of the year and cash from operations does tend to be more loaded into the second and third quarters of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Rushmire - Barclays Capital.", "Peter Rushmire - Barclays Capital.", "I was hoping you could help us to quantify the resin inflation that you faced for all of \u201808 and if oil is in fact $57 in \u201809, what does that imply the resin costs relief is for \u201809?", "William Hickey", "Let me comment on your number. I think we have said through the year 2008 as we went through quarter-by-quarter. The impact for the year was something over $120 million as additional costs in 2008 over 2007. And if you then take that back the other way in terms of 2008 to 2009, we\u2019re looking at something in the $100 million range.", "Peter Rushmire - Barclays Capital.", "On a related point, if we were to look at the annualized run rate from the fourth quarter given the stickiness of some of the resins, how much would the run rate be down already from the fourth quarter versus how much is still ahead of us?", "William Hickey", "I am not sure I understand or prepared to answer that right now. Our assumption I will tell you is that we\u2019re using the fourth quarter as a going-in point to 2009. We\u2019re looking at that being in that sort of general range through the second quarter, and then the likelihood that there will be an up tick in the second half of the year ending up where our 57 average, and the oil is now averaging under 50 for the first three weeks of January. So, obviously our assumption of 57 takes us to some number over 60 by the end of the year.", "Peter Rushmire - Barclays Capital.", "If I could ask just a quick financial question, maybe for Dave. Is it possible to comment on the performance of the pension in \u201808, your outlook for the funding status, whether you plan to contribute or not, and whether you can provide guidance on the non-cash pension impact on the income statement?", "David Kelsey", "Pension is a very modest liability for us. Frankly, it is so modest it is not the kind of question we prepare for these earnings calls. We\u2019re talking about a funding requirement that\u2019s significantly less than $20 million, maybe less than $10 million a year. Most of the programs we have except for ones that is are government mandated are frozen. So, as we look at 2009, sources and uses of cash, pension is nothing more than a footnote.", "William Hickey", "Operator, let me just take a couple of questions that have come in from the Internet, which I will just take right now. The first question that came in on the call is; what is the approximate amount of Sealed Air\u2019s equipment sales in 2008 and how does this compare to 2007 replacement cycle and years? Equipment has always been less than 10% of our business. We have always liked to characterize our model as razor and razor blade, and the 90% business is the consumable which is used over and over again. Equipment placements are up slightly in 2008 over 2007 and as I believe I said during my prepared comments, most of that was in the first three quarters of the year. The equipment life cycle, it is very different depending on the business we\u2019re in.", "On the protective side, some of the packaging systems we place at customers generally run three to four years. Some of the more expensive food packaging equipment runs kind of seven to ten years. So there is a mix and the price tag on those ranges anywhere from $1,500 to close to $1 million again depending on the type of equipment. So, I can\u2019t put it into a simple couple of points, but it is a relatively small part of the business, but it does drive use of consumables.", "Next question quickly off the Internet. 2009 will be clearly reflected by the economy, longer term, we are still committed to the business segment performance that we outlined earlier in 2008, and I won\u2019t predict how quickly we\u2019ll get back to that because the best economists in the world have yet to figure out how we\u2019re going to get out of the slump we\u2019re in right now, but our expectations have not changed.", "There is a comment about, will we expanded the liquidity from $300 million note. We think we purchased shares in 2009 versus 2008, I just will not comment on that right now. Let me move down here. What percentage of our 2008 European sales are in the U.K. versus continental Europe? Europe is about 26% to 28% of our overall business, and the U.K. is probably less than 10% of our total business, so I didn\u2019t do the math, but the U.K. had something less than a third of the European part of the business.", "Next question is, is there any equity component to the $300 million notes issued to Davis and Berkshire? No. It is straight debt as Dave said, five-year no call straight debt. And another question on the Internet. What is management\u2019s assumption for resin price reductions for Sealed Air in 2008 excluding volume declines? I think I mentioned that answering the past call is something in the $100 million range, probably just under that number. Let me go back to the next call on the telephone, operator.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joseph Naya - UBS.", "Joseph Naya - UBS ", "When you were talking about volume trends you saw through 2008, you mentioned that part of it was kind of customer de-stocking and part of it was weaker demand. I know it is tough to quantify, but I was just wondering if you could offer any color as to kind of how you saw the break-up between those two components and if you see the de-stocking gaining as you go forward.", "William Hickey", "Joseph, that\u2019s a tough call. I really can\u2019t give you any color because different customers have different issues, but I will say credit markets have focused customers. Our customers on their inventory levels so they\u2019re both a factor. I just wouldn\u2019t venture to say how much was de-stocking versus how much was ultimate measure customer demand.", "Joseph Naya - UBS ", "The one large customer switch that you had, are we past that at this point? Is it anniversaries or will we see continued issues in the comparison going forward?", "William Hickey", "It anniversaried at the end of November, so Case-Ready will not have that drag going forward into 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McNulty - Credit Suisse.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse ", "Two quick questions; the first one with regard to the softer economy, have you seen your customers start to downshift yet toward slightly lower value say protective products or even on the food side or is that something that you don\u2019t expect quite as much of this time around given that they may have already done it when resin prices were spiking and really pinching them in the first place?", "William Hickey ", "We haven\u2019t seen much on that. I will say I know of two customers in Europe who are actually looking at switching down, but that\u2019s the only quantitative reference I had. I think your point is a lot of customers have already done that as we went through the price increases of 2008.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse ", "And then just the other question on the working capital side just to dig in maybe a little bit deeper, looking back to the past two recessions, Sealed Air has seen pretty significant increases or seen their working capital as a real source of cash for them in the past couple of recessions. With that in mind, and the idea that you finally got the SAP systems fully implemented and you\u2019ve got raw materials dropping off the way that you have. Should we be expecting similar type improvements in working capital in \u201809 as we have seen in the past recessions?", "David Kelsey", "John, I think it is reasonable to conclude that working capital given our assumptions for 2009 is going to be a source of funds and not a use of funds. I am going to leave it up to your own modeling capabilities to decide exactly how large a source of funds it will be, but you\u2019re headed in the right direction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Fritz Boncart - Sage Asset Management.", "Fritz Boncart - Sage Asset Management ", "My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from George Staphos - Banc of America Securities.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "Bill, can you give us a bit more detail on the equipment installation that\u2019s occurring in Eastern Europe? I think you said it was for a food customer, but I wanted to verify that and if that was the case what type of product, what type of customer, and I had a follow-up question on that.", "William Hickey", "It is a food packaging customer. It is a food packaging customer that is processing pork.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "", "And what kind of revenue increment could this wind up being say middle of the five-year program?", "William Hickey", "I am not sure I can kind of go there, but they will be processing roughly 10 million plus barrier bags.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "Okay. So not a lot of effect early on. ", "William Hickey", "No.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities Fair enough.", "Fair enough. Back to CapEx, in the environment that we have going into 2009, Dave, why would you spend anything on growth CapEx right now?", "David Kelsey", "Well, as Bill tried to give you in his flavor, there are in fact parts of the business that are growing. As customers focus on those solutions that we have that add value for them, we see growth opportunities in ready meals and our vertical pouch packaging business to name a couple. There are opportunities potentially in the medical area that would also warrant additional spending, but that\u2019s the budget or the forecast if you will or the guidance. It is not anything that we have committed to spend. There is in that 120 to 125 some roll over of growth projects that were approved in the last two years, so if you\u2026", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "100 to 125, right?", "David Kelsey", "Yes. So the maintenance I think we have said has tended to run in the $70 million range, so it is not a lot in there for growth, but we do expect there to be some opportunities that have good paybacks that we will do to support some of the growth areas of the business.", "George Staphos - Banc of America Securities ", "I think that last point you made if customers are coming to you in an uncertain environment to put capital into the business, hopefully they\u2019re willing to pay a sufficiently higher return and price for that given the environment. Anyway I will turn it over.", "William Hickey", "Let me take another question here from the Internet. I have a question, is the revolving credit facility secured? How much security is available? Let me just sort of go right to the answer here, is that all of Sealed Air\u2019s borrowings are unsecured. Let me move onto the next question. A question about of the 300 million commitment what\u2019s the commitment amount of Davis Berkshire. I\u2019m not prepared to disclose that. I think that\u2019s all we have on the Internet. Do we have any questions left on the telephone, operator?", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "In the other category you are now doing the production and distribution of Ethafoam internally. I would have presumed that that would have impacted your margins positively. Why is it part of the negative factors on the other? This is how I read the press release?", "William Hickey", "Let me just go through the chronology with you. When we bought the Ethafoam business on November 16, 2007, it came with essentially the product line, customer list; it did not include any manufacturing facilities. For all of 2008 or just about all of 2008, we bought all of the product that we sold as Ethafoam from the seller of the business who is the Dow Chemical Company.", "We immediately began to build a factory in Louisville, Kentucky, and one in [Ostrava], Poland where we will self-manufacture the Ethafoam product line. Between getting the buildings up, getting the equipment ordered, getting everything installed and started up. We really are only beginning to self-manufacture within weeks, so the impact year-over-year in the fourth quarter where you essentially had no Ethafoam sales except for December which was not a very big month versus 2008 where we bought the full quarter\u2019s supply at a transfer price, which really gave Sealed Air a relatively modest margin for selling the product. In 2009, we will be manufacturing it ourselves, but through 2008 including the fourth quarter we were not.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "In 2009, the margin should actually improve as it has to be more efficient for you to do it than buy it via someone else?", "William Hickey", "Absolutely Rosemary, absolutely. Okay. Operator, I think that wraps up our questions. I really want to thank everyone for participating in the call today. For those of you who do not know it, today is the Ninth Annual Celebration of Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day. It is that time the middle of winter when we commemorate and we celebrate the favorite pop of people around the world. So if you haven\u2019t sent out your Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day cards, there is still some time.", "I would also like to thank all of our employees and partners around the world for all of your effort and hard work in a very, very difficult year. As a team, we continue to believing and remain committed to our long-term growth strategies that capitalize on our strong global footprint, diverse product portfolio, and strong customer service levels.", "We will stay the course on innovation. We will continue to capitalize on growth opportunities in emerging markets. We will invest wisely in our core businesses, and we will improve efficiency and productivity to optimize our cost structure and most importantly, we will stay focused on our customers, combined with maintaining a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows, and a solid liquidity position to meet our financial obligations. We are well-positioned for growth once market conditions improve. Thank you all for taking the time to listen to us today.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We would like to thank everyone for their participation and wish everyone a great day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NYSE:SEE) Q2 2009 Earnings Call July 29, 2009 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Amanda Butler - Director of IR", "Bill Hickey - President and CEO", "Dave Kelsey - SVP and CFO", "Analysts", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research Equities", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Operator", "Good morning everyone and welcome to the Sealed Air conference call discussing the company's second quarter 2009 results. This call is being recorded. Leading the call today we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Office. (Operator Instructions).", "Now at this time I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us.", "Our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. We have also posted supplemental financial information and reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP measures that we expect to discuss on our website at sealedair.com, in the investor information section, under quarterly results. And now I will turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "Bill Hickey", "", "Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. I'm Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today, in addition to Amanda, we have David Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.", "During today's call, I would like to highlight our business performance and touch upon our 2009 full year guidance. Dave, will then discuss details of our financial results. After Dave's remarks, we will take your questions; both from the telephone lines and from text submitted on our webcast.", "Earlier today, we reported our second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.34 which was in line with consensus expectations for the second quarter. This excludes the $0.01 charge for our global manufacturing strategy or GMS. I believe that our performance reinforces the effectiveness of our ongoing expense control efforts. It also reflects the benefits of our GMS program and the cost reduction in productivity programs which combined delivered approximately $20 million of benefits in the quarter or approximately $40 million year-to-date.", "The quarter also highlighted our ability to remain disciplined on price which was evident in our $23 million price mix contribution in the quarter. Also the quarter reflected a $60 million reduction in the resin spread versus 2008 or flat resin prices sequentially.", "There are three additional factors that held back potential gross margin expansion in Q2. First, we continue to move forward with our plant startups in Louisville, Kentucky, and Poland. Although, this negatively impacted the quarter, we continue to believe that these new facilities along with other new facilities in China and Mexico will be positive contributors to profit when the economy does turnaround.", "Second, we reduced inventory by approximately $50 million which actually had the effective of increasing costs of good by approximately $5 million in the quarter. ", "Lastly, due to the slow economy, we were still selling the remaining inventory purchase from Dow Chemical as part of the Ethafoam acquisition at last December's resin prices. These costs are clearly part of our ongoing business, while as you work comparisons it is helpful to understand some of the details behind the reported numbers.", "Overall, our results reflected a 220 basis point increase in our gross profit margin and a 160 basis point increase in our operating margin to 11.5% year-over-year. This is also a 2% increase on our operating profit excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.", "I should point out that our food businesses achieved a significant increase in operating margins. These business combined achieved 13% increase in their operating profit in the quarter or a 23% increase in operating profit if you exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. ", "Looking at our top line performance, our sales declined 11% excluding the impact of currency translation. Our unit volumes declined 12% on year-over-year basis or essentially flat sequentially. This reinforces our view that our end-markets have stabilized which is a reassuring step towards an expected slow recovery in the latter part of the year.", "During this challenging quarter our team continued to work to deliver these results in a weak demand environment. I also feel that our results are noteworthy, considering that our business has a higher industrial component and a more diverse international footprint then many companies in our sector.", "Looking at our business geographically or in a tour of the world approach, we saw that our North American sales declined approximately 14% year-over-year driven primarily by the decline in industrial production and retail sales which negatively impacted our Protective Packaging and Specialty Materials business. To a lesser extent, the modest decline in fresh meat production in the United States also contributed to the decrease.", "In Latin America, we saw sales increase 6% excluding the impact of currency translation. In fact, if you exclude Brazil, organic sales in the region increased 11% in the quarter. I should note that although Brazilian sales declined, the rate of decline was in the low single digit percent range reflecting an improvement in the market conditions in Brazil since the first quarter.", "In Europe, our overall sales declined 12% excluding the impact of currency translation. We continue to see a year-over-year decline in sales in Western Europe, primarily due to a decline in meat consumption and a decline in industrial output.", "However, the Eastern and Central European part of our business had a sales increase of 9% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The driver behind this growth was primarily our Food Business which continued to generate high single digit percent growth rates in attractive markets such as Russia and Poland.", "And finally the Asia-Pacific region saw a total sales decline 8% excluding the impact of currency translation. ", "Our Australian business saw local currency sales decline 3%, a reflection of flat slaughter rates and a weak meat export market due to the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar. ", "The balance of the region was negatively impacted by the decline in exports from Asia which are off 30% to 40% around the region. ", "Looking specifically at our developing region sales as a whole, sales decline 1% excluding the impact of currency translation. This performance really reflects the impact of our Brazilian business whose own performance improved sequentially which I previously mentioned. ", "Looking, at our business by reportable segments, I would like to highlight that in our Food Packaging business all region volumes track to local animal processing rates. I should note that our U.S. volume results were impacted by last year's accelerated buying by our customers in the second quarter. This was ahead of our transition to a new enterprise software system on July 1, 2008.", "When looking at our food packaging sales performance, excluding this event and the impact of currency translations, our sales are relatively flat versus prior year. Although unit volumes decline, they were in range with what was forecasted due to contracting herd sizes, the ongoing weakness in Brazilian beef exports to Europe and the slowdown in meat consumption in Europe which we have seen for several quarters now. ", "We continue to expect a seasonal volume uptick in the third quarter with summer and the vacation season now in full swing. Also our forecast indicate a pick up in fresh meat production in North America in the second half with June already showing record high production rates in beef.", "Our Food Solutions business continues to reflect the recessionary environment. Case-ready business saw its sales decline by approximately 2% excluding the impact of currency translation. Volumes were relatively flat versus the prior year which strengthens our ground meat segment, pizza solutions and the successful launch of a new deli packed product at two large retailers in the United States.", "I am also pleased to report that our sales team has done a great job in establishing the new case-ready format Mirabella, in Europe. We have strong product presence in France, Benelux and now in the U.K. where the large English retailer is signing a new contract for the Mirabella product during the second quarter.", "Our ready meals sales declined in the quarter as consumers opted for more economical frozen products and prospective customers have slowed their adoption of new products due to the recession. Despite this, we did expand our business with our largest ready meals customer providing them with a unique and differentiated film for use on an aluminum tray application.", "In our vertical pouch business, our sales declined approximately 10% excluding the impact of currency translation. In the second quarter which saw a 28 year low in U.S. restaurant food traffic, our business continued to fair reasonably well and we believe that some of the decline is attributable to the timing of orders. Related to this factor in Europe, we signed a three-year contract with a large multinational food processor, reflecting the ongoing attractiveness and volume that are solution offers. ", "Moving on to the Protective Packaging segment, this segment's performance continues to reflect the difficult recessionary environment and the global decline in manufacturing output and retail sales. Our sales, excluding the impact of currency translation, declined approximately 20%, as did our volumes. However, volumes were relatively flat sequentially and in line with proxies such as intermodal shipping rates and international air cargo shipments. They are also in line with declining export rates out of countries like China, Taiwan and Mexico where many of our protective packaging products are used. ", "Our business reported no loss of market share and in fact some slight gains in this challenging environment. What we are seeing, in the markets there are customers who have destocked, running their business on very lean inventories, almost just-in-time approach and are remaining cautious about new investments. ", "On a reassuring note however, we are no longer seeing that sense of panic and downright pessimism in our end-markets which really characterize much of the previous two quarters. ", "Our protective packaging team worked very diligently this quarter to remain disciplined on price. As you can see by our results, we did report a decline of approximately $5 million in product price mix. This decline reflects some customer shifts to more economical choices and some price concessions on our more mature products such as our traditional Bubble Wrap product and thin foams. ", "We were and continue to be very successful in our placements of our new solutions such as Pack-Tiger, lightweight new air packaging and even with our priority pack placements being ahead of last year's levels. ", "Finally, our other category sales performance declined 29%, largely reflecting the same recessionary pressures that we are experiencing in our Protective Packaging business.", "On a final note which crosses all of our business segments, we have noted that our equipment sales, which as you know represent approximately 10% of our business, are down 35% to 40% depending on the business segment due to the reluctance of customers to invest in new capital items.", "Before I hand the call over to Dave, I would like to touch upon on our full year 2009 earnings guidance. As you saw in our press release today, we are continuing to hold on to our original guidance range of $1.17 to $1.37 or $1.25 to $1.45 on an adjusted basis. After reviewing our year-to-date performance, we feel that we are still on track to perform within these ranges.", "We are also maintaining our earlier assumptions regarding raw material prices and expectations for full year benefits from our various cost savings initiatives. Because the range is wide, I'd like to comment on our assumption is that if the economy's recovery is delayed or is a tepid recovery, we will anticipate being at the lower end of the range. However, if the economy benefits from a stronger recovery and stimulus effects begin to be seen, we would expect to be at the higher end of our range.", "Now I'm going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey, to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?", "Dave Kelsey", "Thank you, Bill. As Bill stated our sales were $1.28 billion for the quarter. For those of you participating in the call who would like additional detail, tables posted on our website, sealedair.com present the components of the change in net sales by business segment and by geography, the impact of currency translation on sales by geographic region, and the percentage of sales by geographic region. ", "Moving down the P&L statement, gross profit was $288 million, a decrease of $42 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Excluding foreign currency translation of $27 million, gross profit would have been $315 million, lower than last year by approximately $15 million.", "Our lower sales volume particularly in the Protective Packaging segment was the primary contributing factor, which as Bill mentioned, is more sensitive to the recessionary environment and the global decline in manufacturing output and retail sales. ", "Marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased to $34 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. On a constant dollar basis operating expenses were $185 million, lower by $18 million or a decrease of 9% as compared to the prior year.", "Approximately one-third of the year-over-year improvement is attributable to our cost reduction in productivity program. Also travel and entertainment expense has been managed down approximately $3 million from the prior year as we have made greater use of teleconferencing and required less travel for GMS and SAP related projects. ", "Operating profit decreased $8 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year. Excluding the effects of currency translation, operating profit for the second quarter would have been $128 million or 2% higher than the prior year, reflecting the benefits from our various cost initiatives in an otherwise weaker demand environment.", "Interest expense increased by $8 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily reflecting the interest on our 12% notes issued in February of this year. In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded charges of $3 million largely in cost of sales related to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. We still expect to realize incremental benefits of $20 million in 2009 bringing our cumulative benefits to $45 million and increasing to $55 million in 2010 and thereafter.", "Summarizing the cost reduction and productivity program we announced in July of 2008, we have reduced employment by approximately 900 personnel or 5% of our workforce from June 30th, 2008. We've realized approximately $13 million of savings in the second quarter and approximately $26 million of savings year-to-date. These savings were split almost equally between costs of sales and operating expenses.", "From a cash flow perspective, we've made cash payments of approximately $10 million in the second quarter and approximately $25 million year-to-date for termination benefits. The majority of the remaining $18 million in payments will be made during the balance of this year with approximately $5 million falling into 2010.", "I'll conclude with some key balance sheet and cash flow items. Our accounts receivable increased $5 million on a constant dollar basis from March 31, 2009. Also on a constant dollar basis and excluding the utilization of our receivables program in June of 2008, accounts receivable would have decreased approximately 12% compared to June of last year.", "In this year's second quarter, we did not sell any receivables under our accounts receivable securitization facility. We are well prepared to manage our receivables balances in the current economic climate. Our day sales outstanding were lower at June 30, 2009 than at June of 2008. Credit collection is one of our many noteworthy efforts in the current economy. ", "Inventory investment at June 30th, declined $20 million from March 31, 2009. On a constant dollar basis inventories decreased $48 million. This decline is attributable to a decrease in inventory primarily in Europe and in North America. Part of the decline in North America is attributed to the successful efforts to reduce inventories in our U.S. food segments subsequent to the July 1, 2008 go-live of SAP.", "Our Protective Packaging segment inventory declined due to the decline in the sales volumes. Compared to June 30 of last year, inventory investment was down $127 million or $74 million after adjusting for currency translation. A coordinated effort, involving sales, supply chain and customer service with support from finance and information systems, has driven this exceptional performance. We expect continued improvement in our inventory investment in the second half of 2009.", "Total net borrowings at June 30 were $1.259 billion, down $171 million from the end of December. This decrease is attributable to the free cash flow we generated in the first half of 2009. Also as mentioned in our earnings release on July 20, we redeemed all $431 million of our 3% convertible notes which had an initial put date of June 2010. We used the net proceeds from our 7 7/8 % senior notes issuance and available cash to fund this redemption which has benefited our balance sheet and effectively extended our next debt maturity to 2013. ", "The February and June senior note issuances and the May and July senior note redemptions will result in a net additional $36 million of interest expense for the full year 2009 as compared to the prior year. This replaces earlier guidance of a net additional $25 million increase in interest expense for the full year. ", "I will conclude by providing some details on Sealed Air's liquidity position. First, on June 30th, we had slightly less than $800 million in cash and cash equivalents before redeeming our 3% convertible notes on July 20. In addition we have access to nearly $700 million of committed borrowing capacity. Today, our total available liquidity exceeds $1 billion. ", "Free cash flow, one of our key metrics of the management team, gets close attention. As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, free cash flow for the six months ended June 2009 was a source of $228 million compared to a use of $6 million last year. As I stated previously, our accounts receivable and inventory investment levels were a source of free cash flow year-to-date. ", "Capital investment is lower in 2009 as well as work is largely completed on our three new plants in emerging markets. Our range for total capital spending continues to be $100 million to $125 million, to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects. Our current liquidity position and our projected free cash flow position us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W. R. Grace settlement should it become payable within the next 12 months. Please note though that there is still no date certain for the funding of this settlement.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "Bill Hickey", "Thank you, Dave. Operator, I would now like to open the call up to any questions from the participants and we will follow-up with any questions from our webcast participants as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We'll go first to George Staphos, with Bank of America.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Couple of quick questions to start, number one, was there any appreciable effect on volume do you think, Dave or Bill form H1N1? And then the related follow-on, can you give us a bit more color on trends within case-ready by geography, have you seen a pick up in North America after some of the volume loss that's occurred in the last couple of years? Thanks", "Bill Hickey", "George, on HINI, our numbers in may show; pork was really down 27% in May, but that's the total market in terms of information we have. That's not our sales. But the total pork and pork meats from the U.S. government report show down 27%. We did have slightly down numbers in pork in the second quarter. Our numbers were down more, 3% to 5% range in North America. In Mexico, we did see an effect in pork meat and that was again over a very hectic three week period. So the answer to your question is yes, but it was short lived. It was mainly in May.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "It could have been a point or two in your food volume [significant].", "Bill Hickey", "I don't think it was a point or two.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right. Trying to help you out there\u2026", "Bill Hickey", "Okay. Yes\u2026", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "So for case-ready\u2026", "Bill Hickey", "On case-ready, case-ready volumes are reasonably consistent around the world. The numbers I have is down 11% for the quarter year-over-year, and that's equally spread between North America and Europe. Latin America, I think, was more pretty stable in case-ready and Asia was actually also stable in case-ready.", "There is no particular trend, Europe is actually doing a little better in case-ready because of Mirabella they've been an early adopter of Mirabella in case-ready where the U.S. has been a little bit slow on that. That's sort of a quick outlook on it. And what was your sort of third piece?", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "No, you've generally hit it there. Just maybe a quick aside, why is Europe adopting Mirabella quicker? Thanks. ", "Bill Hickey", "Yeah, I guess you see a lot of the food innovations come out of Europe. But Europe tends to be more open to making reasonably quick changes in their packaging formats, and that's the only reason I can attribute it to.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Hey, Bill, as it relates to your guidance, volumes do fail to recover in the second half of the year. It seems like you are pointing towards the low end of the range. Does that also assume that resin stays flat from current levels or are you assuming a decline in the fourth quarter in resin? Thanks.", "Bill Hickey", "I think the resin number, we are essentially saying, our guidance suggested perhaps a slight uptick, but that's kind of still in the cards, there are announced price increases out there. There are announced price increases. But we haven't seen them at this point, Ghansham and a lot of it depends on what you see for coming on stream in the Middle East.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Okay and then just given what you have announced from a restructuring standpoint but putting into context with the volumes declines you are seeing. Are there plans to expand the scope of your restructuring plans? Thanks.", "Bill Hickey", "Dave, you want to address that?", "Dave Kelsey", "I'm sorry, Ghansham I didn't catch that restructuring plan? You are referring to the plan that we announced in June of last year?", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Yes.", "Dave Kelsey", "Okay. Right now we are still seeing benefit as we mentioned $13 million in the second quarter. I think any further actions will depend on what happens in the economy in the second half of the year. As Bill indicated, we think we are very well positioned to address increased volume when the economy comes back and I will emphasize when and not if. So we want to make sure that we have that readiness to serve capacity in place.", "Operator", "We will go next to Claudia Hueston with JP Morgan.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Just following up on the question on the guidance, I just want to be clear that has your outlook for EBIT changed? Did your guidance before take into account the incremental interest expense and the increase in that share count that you'll see for the rest of the year? Is the operating profit outlook better now versus last quarter?", "Bill Hickey", "I'll let Dave answer but share count actually goes down Claudia.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Yeah, down, sorry.", "Dave Kelsey", "The guidance we gave back at the start of the year which is the $1.25 to $1.45. So we have been consistent with that since January, did assume the 12% notes that we issued in the first quarter. The more recent financing we did in June does have about a $0.03 dilutive effect for the balance of the year but we are absorbing that into the guidance range rather than change our guidance.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "What's the timing for the startup of the new facilities? In other words, when should those costs that have been hurting your results a little bit, start to go away?", "Bill Hickey", "Actually, the third quarter, Louisville is on-stream. Poland actually came on-stream end of the second quarter. So they will be flowing through normal operations, both of them, in the third quarter. But unfortunately they will be underutilized, Claudia, because of the lower volumes in the economy, but they will be running as part of normal operations.", "Claudia Hueston - JP Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will go next to Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research Equities", "I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on price trends throughout the quarter and what you saw there in competitive activity.", "Bill Hickey", "I will just comment generally that there continues to be reasonable price pressure due to lower resin prices. Although you see if you look at the price volume mix numbers which are posted on the website, actually for the quarter price continued to be positive in the protective business, little softer on the food business, and primarily because the number of contracts that we do have with certain large customers do ratchet down automatically based on index cost.", "So you will see that on the food side little bit of a ratcheting down in costs, little up in protective through the second quarter. Competitive activity continues to be primarily price based. There is a number of people in our space, both on the food and protective side that continue to try to seek share by lowering prices. We were countering the best way we know how is to work on the value of our offer and continue to show the benefits of the in-use cost of our products versus the purchase price of the competitors. ", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research Equities", "And then to follow up on that, can you just comment on kind of exiting the quarter what price trends look like. And then also recent volume trends have you seen any kind of a pick up more recently in volume trends? Thank you.", "Bill Hickey", "I will answer the second part of your question first because I just looked at that yesterday afternoon. Volume trends continues stable. Volume trends continues stable in terms of no appreciable pick up in terms of what we are looking at either in orders per day or sales per week. They are tracking pretty consistently.", "So, we have not experienced an upturn in the economy at this point yet. On the look forward on price, we are probably looking at flat pricing through the food side of the business to the second half of the year and perhaps an additional 3% or so concessions on the protective side.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research Equities", "Great, thanks a lot and good luck in the quarter.", "Dave Kelsey", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Richard Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Kind of just a follow up on that volume question Bill, can you talk a little bit more about protective and what you are seeing in the protective business specifically on volumes? Why you think you have not yet seen any meaningful or at least some slight improvement on the protective side?", "Bill Hickey", "Well, protective volumes have been reasonably flat since probably February. If you look at a kind of a graph of sales from February through, even through early in the third quarter, it's essentially a reasonably flat line, and it's reasonably consistent in U.S., North America which are two biggest markets.", "I had the benefit of being in Asia back in May, the end of May, and went to some of our protective customers in May and a number of companies in China whose principal business is to export to the U.S. and Europe were running at less than 50% of capacity and that's as recently as May and a number of them were feeling that they wouldn't see turnarounds until probably third quarter when they hope that the U.S. customers will begin to look for holiday orders which generally hit Asia in the August-September period. ", "Now, Protective is more of a coincident indicator, so I wouldn't look at Protective as being a leading indicator because I know most of the media and most analysts are saying that leading indicators are looking more positive. If you actually look at the production cycle, we are usually the last product to be ordered.", "A lot of our manufacturing customers will order their raw materials, go through the production cycle and since most of our Protective products are one to three days lead time, we are generally at the end of the cycle, so by the time the products are ordered from us, the early signs of recovery are starting to happen. So if I look at the last couple of recessions whether it was 2001 in the tech or '91 we tended to be more coincident with the market and I wouldn't expect it to be any different at this time.", "Richard Skidmore - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Just to follow-up, the geographic mix then, it sounds like maybe North America is down similar to what may be corrugated packaging is down kind of the 10% or 12% in the quarter, and Asia and Europe are down something larger than the 20% volume decline that you posted for this segment. Is that correct?", "Bill Hickey", "Yes, that's fairly right. Europe is a little bit lower than North America but not down as low as Asia.", "Dave Kelsey", "The other thing that we've tracked, I think we mentioned it back on our first quarter call, is the experience that 3M has had in their industrial and transportation sector and their electronics and communication sector, both of which match up against a lot of the end markets globally that we sell into in Protective. Looking at the 3M earnings release last week, they were down 21% in volume in their industrial businesses and 27% in their electronics business. We feel very comfortable. We are tracking exactly what's going on in the economy.", "Operator", "We will go to Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital.", "I wanted to follow up with your comments, Bill, on equipment sales being down 35%, 40% and whether those kinds of numbers are sustainable? How soon might the customers need to replenish almost regardless of the economic outlook or is it something that could remain weak? Do you have much visibility over the next couple of quarters on those equipment sales coming back?", "Bill Hickey", "Let me answer your question. I am of the view that probably like a lot of people is, at some point people are going to have, have to replace equipment, have to replace inventory. To me it's a matter of time. I know our prospect list is good. We were able to place even in this environment a million dollar piece of equipment at a customer in Europe.", "So, the prospect list is good. It hasn't converted to orders yet. Our visibility in equipment generally goes out only generally five to six weeks. So, I can't see it on the horizon yet at this point.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital.", "Okay. That's helpful. And I was also hoping you could elaborate, I didn't quite follow your commentary initially, Bill, on passing the legacy higher resin costs through the higher cost from December, following that logic I would think you would start to be passing through the lower resin costs from 1Q, 2Q which I would think will be showing up as a benefit in 3Q, 4Q?", "Bill Hickey", "Yes, let me try to keep this simple. At the end of December, we canceled a supply agreement that we had with Dow Chemical, when we bought the Ethafoam business; we bought the product line but not the manufacturing facility. So, we entered into a supply agreement which ran for an 18 month period where Dow Chemical would supply us with Ethafoam product while we built the capacity to manufacture that product ourselves.", "We wanted to cancel that agreement at the end of December. However, we knew our new plants would not be up and running until early 2009. So, we ordered several months worth of inventory from Dow Chemical which we received in December at a transfer price per the acquisition agreement that we anticipated we would sell through the first quarter.", "Because of the slowdown in the economy, a fair amount of that inventory carried over into the second quarter. We actually sold almost all of it with the balance at the end of the second quarter being only several million dollars. So, we were selling December inventory in both the first and the second quarter and that is the impact that flows through cost.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital.", "That is helpful. And just not to belabor the point but is the cash flow benefit noteworthy in terms of your cash production costs of making that product relative to your purchase prices? Is that a noteworthy item of flux as we look at 3Q versus what you have experienced in the first half?", "Bill Hickey", "I think we said last year sometime that on an annual basis the difference between making the product ourselves and buying it under the supply agreement could be as much as $0.04 to $0.05 per share.", "Operator", "We will go next to Mark Wilde, with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Just curious, is there a point here whereof the volumes don't pickup or don't pickup appreciably that you will think about more capacity rationalization?", "Bill Hickey", "", "That's one has to always think about and to say, not only in capacity rationalization but we just put in four new plants in the last 18 months, four new state-of-the-art plants that have actually added to our capacity over the last 18 months. To come right to your question, yes, we are looking at it and we do look at it, and if need be, we will take the necessary action.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Then just as a follow on. Dave Kelsey, can you just talk about what you're doing to kind of watch potential credit losses? I guess I am thinking particularly of potential problems with some of the big meat packers, if one of the big poultry companies go out of business earlier this year?", "Dave Kelsey", "The best way to do that is to try our best to see into the future. We do have longstanding relationships with most of our customers. So we have various early warning systems in terms of looking at their order trends. We have people with very good industry knowledge that are regularly collecting information from the market, so that we have historically done a very good job in avoiding balance run-ups prior to a customer getting into a serious trouble.", "Our ability to recover on the back-end has also been very good, because as long as that customer stays in business in a restructuring mode, it needs to continue to package its end product. If we are the preferred supplier as they get into trouble we are usually the preferred supplier as they restructure which has tended to work to our benefit.", "I think even more important in terms of our focus in the domestic situation is the global situation in the emerging markets and we have people on the ground in those markets that have the same close customer contact that we have with our customers in North America and Europe. And so it is a time of certainly of high diligence in this environment. But so far we are very pleased with the performance relative to our accounts receivable.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank", "Okay thanks, Dave. That's helpful.", "Bill Hickey", "I just want to remind you if you listen to Dave's comment earlier he basically said are actually days sales outstanding are better. In fact, yesterday afternoon I just went through a list of our credit exposures and I will tell you the group's done a very, very good job on keeping tight reins on potentially problem accounts. Next, operator?", "Operator", "And we will go next to Rosemarie Morbelli with Ingalls & Snyder.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "", "Bill, could you give us a little more detail on the consumer interest and the pilot test that you refer to in your press release, in which categories are they and what could be the potential size and timing of those new products?", "Bill Hickey", "Well, I think the one we talked about is in case-ready Mirabella which I think you may have seen the product, we did show it in Atlanta when we had some people down the platform. It is a tray with a much lower profile than the earlier versions of case-ready and because of the technology the top film can actually touch the meat in the tray without changing the color of the meat, keeping the meat red, so it looks much more like store packed meat.", "The other item which is in my quote earlier in the press release is in the Business Week article there was a collage of our Marinade on Demand, which allows the consumer to buy a fresh piece of meat with a marinade package right next to it in the same overall wrap with a frangible seal. That is being introduced by one of our customers in the north central part of the country. The third is the deli packed product. So, those are the three new items that we referred to in our communications and press release.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "Nothing on the Protective Packaging side?", "Bill Hickey", "We have got automation continuing to drive in Protective Package. The thing that we are bringing to the market in Protective Packaging is more automated systems. You heard me say in my prepared comments priority pack which is probably, to answer an earlier question, is different trend than the equipment trend overall.", "Priority pack which is actually our highest price protective packaging system piece of equipment actually had a sales increase because the customer benefits in terms of labor savings and productivity far, far outweigh what the customers were doing before. They are willing to step-up to that investment with a very, very short payback.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder ", "Thanks. That is very helpful. If you could talk about any sign or [like the roles] of pick up on the e-commerce side, is it as bad as the rest of Protective or do you see a little light at that end?", "Bill Hickey", "If I look at the numbers and I'm just drawing kind of take a couple of accounts that I know if you look the Protective being down close to 20%. Some of the e-commerce are more down in the 12% to 13% on the e-commerce side, while the retail piece which is the over-the-counter sales of Bubble Wrap is probably down more than 20%. But those that go through e-commerce fulfillment which is not the consumer segment, but it's a different segment for us on e-commerce is more 13% to 15%.", "Operator", "And we will go next to George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "A couple of questions, bigger picture to wrap-up, at least from my side. Bill, first off, what do you think the impact if any, will there be from some of the recent consolidation that we have seen within the flexible packaging sector? Could it make for more competition or do you think perhaps it might bring more focus on returns within this sector? How do you think about that? Then I have a follow on.", "Bill Hickey", "Sure. Any answer I have will be speculation.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "I understand.", "Bill Hickey", "If you look at other industries, consolidation has generally led to more discipline in the marketplace. So, I see that more likely than not, but I'm not going to predict behaviors of other companies and other organizations. But in other industries I have looked at and you can see it over time that has generally been the trend.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "And I guess just to finish the thought you are not as concerned perhaps then about any kind of pick up from competition then?", "Bill Hickey", "Well, it's interesting. I don't think the competition kind of changes. They just form different parts of different organizations. Basically they are still there.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "The other question I had and I will turn it over, you know, the implication in your guidance, some of the earlier comments, is that ultimately when the economy recovers obviously your volumes are going to pick up and you would expect to see an improvement in earnings progressions and cash flow and alike and that's understandable. But I will go back and look at some of the longer term trends, in periods where volumes have been strong for you in prior years, there has been margin pressure.", "When you get some margin relief like we have had this year, volumes have been under pressure because of the economy and your EBITDA while it's been stable, and that's not bad, it's been between, call it $650 million and $750 million, over the last 10 years. So, as we look out to the future, what do you think the reasons are, that going forward as the economy picks up, you will actually be able to see that leverage in your margins and ultimately in your earnings per share? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.", "Bill Hickey", "Okay, thank you. Let me answer your question, but let me also go back and be sure that I gave you the right answer on case-ready. I think I gave you the sales number and I get the impression you asked for the volume number. The volume number is essentially flat in North America and slightly negative in Europe on a case-ready unit volume. ", "Bill Hickey", "Okay.", "", "Bill Hickey", "The number I gave you for down 11% is a sales number globally for case-ready which includes some of the pricing and mix issues. Volumes are flat, slightly down in Europe and the sales number the 11% I gave you was the sales number. Okay?", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for that.", "Bill Hickey", "Now coming back to what's different this time, well, I think that the global manufacturing strategy has redesigned [for] so the manufacturing footprint for the company. We have lowered our break even cost. We've lowered our ongoing cost structure and we can still crank out the same amount of sales.", "The leverage on the upside is substantially more than it had been five years ago. I consider that really a positive for the longer term. The second is when you go through the really turndown in the economy and I know earlier in the year, late last year, a number of people asked numerous times about how does Sealed Air usually perform in an economic downturn? The references we looked at, we looked at 2001, we looked at 1991, we looked at 1982 and in all of those downturns, the Protective business never declined more than single digits. ", "Clearly, as we are all finding out the dramatic downturn in the economy this time around has exceeded those three recessions. Numbers I look at and I'm sure you see the same thing is that, this downturn is perhaps the worst since the great downturn of the '30s. The numbers we felt earlier about trying to weather our way through and low single-digit downturns in Protective clearly didn't turn out to be the case. But it has forced us to really look at how we go to market. How we produce and how we sell? And we will learn and take the benefit of that learning through the upturn. I mean, we are as lean as we ever been and are smarter than we've ever been.", "We have really gone through a detailed analysis of what it costs to serve all of our customers. What it costs to produce and deliver all of our products, and the information availability on a global basis through the new technology we have in the SAP system. It's amazing how much more we know and how quickly, so the combination of taking costs out of the business that we cannot allow to creep back in and using the information technology we have to manage products and customers. I think that we will be able to be more profitable on the upturn this time around than we had been in '82 and '91 and 2001.", "George Staphos - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. We will turn it over and we will pick it up next time. Good luck in the quarter.", "Bill Hickey", "We got a couple of quick questions on the Internet I'd like to go through. Some of them have probably been covered. One person asked, what do we mean by currency translation? Is that another way of saying a stronger U.S. dollar?", "That's correct. As the dollar is stronger, our earnings in other parts of the world have been less and that's what I mean by currency translation. ", "Someone asked me to refresh, new capacities come on-stream in emerging markets. Over the last 18 months, we have brought on a new factory in China. We brought on a new factory in Poland. We brought on a new factory in Mexico. And we brought on a new factory in Louisville, Kentucky, in the U.S.", "Those factories, three of them serve the food business and three of them serve a combination of the Protective business and the Specialty Materials business. And our footprint there is a lot of growth in the future is going to come out of those markets and we wanted to produce in places where our costs are much lower than the manufacturing production we previously had to serve those markets in the U.S. and Western Europe. ", "Someone asked have we finished raising cash to fund the Grace settlement. Let me ask Dave to address that quickly.", "Dave Kelsey", "As I mentioned in my scripted remarks, we have a $1 billion plus liquidity in July. The Grace obligation today is about $725 million. So, we are well set to fund that Grace settlement when it comes due.", "Bill Hickey", "Okay and the very last question from the Internet is comment that last quarter we mentioned that the sales personnel we are really calling and are calling for price increases that we are starting to gain new customers. This is happening. We are signing up new business, particularly in some of the newer products.", "Obviously the economy has had a factor on that. But as we look at our business, we have not lost any significant customers, at customers where we had long term relationships; we definitely see volumes are down. But we are continuing to place new systems in the Protective side, particularly with Pack-Tiger and our new high speed inflatable Bubble material. We are actually for the first time, we had a customer ask us to slow it down because it was so fast.", "With that, I would like to wrap up the call here. Before we leave today, I would like to recognize all of Sealed Air people around the world who help drive innovation which is a real source of pride and our long term success. During the quarter, our innovation gained recognition in a number of places, including our Marinade on Demand product which was showcased in the Business Week review of the grocery store of the future.", "Additionally our Renew-a-Pak bake ware product from our Biosphere venture won the DuPont Award for packaging innovation in the area of sustainability. We are proud of our accomplishments which give us great momentum for the second half of the year when we will be launching several new products into the market.", "Lastly, thank you for participating in the call. We are looking ahead to the second year, focused on expense control, recognizing the benefits of our various costs and productivity initiatives and delivering measurable value for our customers and our shareholders, while navigating through one of the most challenging economies in our lifetimes. Thank you very much for taking the time to listen.", "Operator", "Once again that does conclude today's conference.

This call is being recorded.  Leading the call today William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  After managements\u2019 prepared comments they will be taking questions.  (Operator Instructions)  Now, at this time I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations.", "Amanda Butler", "", "Before we begin our call today I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating managements\u2019 outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements.  These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us.  Our future performance may be different due to a number of factors.  Many of these factors are listed in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10Q which you can find on our website at www.SealedAir.com.  ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill Hickey, our CEO.", "William V. Hickey ", "Welcome to what is coincidentally the celebration of bubble wrap appreciation day.  I\u2019m Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation.  With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have David Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.  During today\u2019s call I would like to highlight our business performance for the year, provide highlights for the quarter and touch upon our 2010 guidance.  Dave will then discuss details of our financial results.  After Dave\u2019s remarks we will take your questions both from the phone lines and via text on our webcast.", "This morning we reported our full year 2009 adjusted earnings per share of $1.44.  This figure excludes a number of items which we highlighted in our press release.  This modest growth in 2009 profit in a very challenging economic environment was a result of stabilizing input costs and benefits generated from the tremendous work and sacrifice by our employees worldwide.  Looking back at the year we initially laid out a number of strategic and operational goals which allowed us to maintain a balanced approach through the recession.", "These included staying focused on the customer, making sure we keep the innovation pipeline flowing, capitalizing on growth in the emerging markets, investing in our core and driving efficiency and productivity.  I am pleased to report that we exceeded our targets in many areas. For example, we broaden our customer base this year as we expanded our solutions in to new regions.  We also continued to expand our presence in existing applications with the strong value propositions and solutions we offer.  ", "We launched over 25 new solutions this year including our first integrated packaging software solution branded PakFormance which allows customers to track yield and productivity on their packaging equipment, our new CT301 shrink film which represents a breakthrough manufacturing technology that produces measurably thinner films that offer the same, if not better performance than thicker films thereby providing a positive environmental story to our customers.  ", "We also expanded our portfolio with products using recycled content including our new Ethafoam HRC which contains a minimum of 65% recycled plastic with little change in the performance characteristics which we are making especially for one computer customer in the Southwest.  ", "Looking to developing regions, we believe that our platform investments position us well to capture the higher rate of recovery coming from these regions in 2010 and beyond.  We saw this in the fourth quarter in particular where we experienced a 12% constant dollar sales increase in the brick countries of the world.  We also saw a 7% constant dollar sales increase in the developing regions overall.  This growth expanded our developing region sales to 17% of our consolidated revenue mix for the full year up from 16% last year.  This continues the long term expansion of our international sales mix which we expect to continue to outpace advanced regions in the years ahead.", "Our global footprint is expected to be a meaningful contributor to our growth and profitability going forward.  As the US and European economies experience below average growth as they gradually recover from the recession and adjust for lower consumer spending as a percentage of GDP, the emerging markets and developing economies of the world will grow faster and our global presence in those markets will be a benefit to our growth. ", "In conjunction with our GMS programs which contributed $20 million of incremental benefit this year we continued to invest in the growth of our core business by upgrading key technologies and expanding product lines in higher growth regions.  We also saw $40 million in benefit from our 2008 cost reduction and productivity program and continued to gain new efficiencies from the deployment of our global SAP system which will drive benefits for us in the years ahead.  All of these efforts contributed to a 320 basis point increase in gross margin to 28.7% and a 340 basis point increase in our operating margin to 11.6% in the year and getting close to that 30% gross profit in the fourth quarter.  Dave will speak to these in more detail in a few minutes.", "Our margin growth especially stands out when looking at this year\u2019s top line sales performance.  Sales declined 7% on a constant dollar basis which primarily reflects an 8% decline in volumes and relatively flat pricing.  As we have highlighted all year, volumes were most impacted in our industrial business while our positions in food and medical held relatively steady.  Looking at price mix we were able to maintain a $21 million price mix spread for the year as food packaging prices offset some selective price declines in our protective packaging business.", "As I believe that our fourth quarter momentum is setting the pace for us in 2010, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items in our largest segments before I discuss our 2010 guidance.  In the quarter we saw a 4% sequential sales increase which excludes foreign exchange.  This increase was led by food packaging with a 6% increase and protective packaging with a 4% increase.  Both of these increases reflect seasonal upticks although the seasonal increase in protective packaging was lower than what we would normally see outside of the recession environment.  This growth combined with the benefits of our various programs and stable input costs helped expand margins in the quarter and we reported a $0.40 adjusted EPS.  ", "Looking at our food packaging business, although we did see strong sequential sales in the quarter, we did experience a 3% volume decline on a year-over-year basis.  This volume decline was largely due to ongoing weak equipment sales due to the economy and primarily in Europe.  On a strong note we saw solid sales growth in our product serving beef and pork applications and we were able to broaden our customer relationships in the Americas and Europe.  ", "In Latin America, strong domestic consumption of beef in Brazil and in Argentina drove solid sales growth in that region.  This effectively jump started double digit sales growth in Brazil and in Argentina, that country saw their highest beef per capita consumption rate in the last 15 years.  ", "Lastly, we launched a number of new products in the fourth quarter.  These included two new automated loaders and our new deli snap tray which is on leading retailer shelves today and we expect more retail debuts to occur in 2010.  We\u2019re expecting these same product trends to continue in 2010 and we expect our efforts will be supported by steady fresh red meat production and growing export levels.  ", "Food solution sales continue to track sequentially flat in the fourth quarter although we did see 5% lower volumes on a year-over-year basis.  This decline is primarily due to lower sales to the food service sector which continues to see record low traffic in restaurants and record lower sales in 2009.  On a positive note, we are pleased with the momentum we\u2019ve started to build in North America with retailers around our new Mirabella case ready format, our Darfresh solution and new versions of our Simple Steps ready meal products. ", "In Europe we are pleased with the acceleration of our case ready sales in Russia and the new placements of our Darfresh solution, both good signs of positive momentum going in to 2010.  As we\u2019re also anticipating a slightly recovery in the restaurant and food service sector in the second half of 2010 we expect to start seeing an increased interest in equipment placements in that segment as well.  ", "Finally, the protective packaging segment experienced its best year-over-year 2009 performance in the fourth quarter with volumes down a modest 3% lower in the quarter.  We still have yet to lap last year\u2019s sales but we do see our performance tracking to proxies and feel that our modest 4% sequential uptick due to seasonality may also be in line.  In the quarter we did see a pace of recovery in the brick regions that was equal or higher than in North America validating our reasons for the global footprint that the company has.", "This was especially true in our shrink film business which saw positive year-over-year growth in Asia in the quarter due to both a pickup of export activity but also to the successful launch of our new CT-301 technology.  The success of CT-301 was also seen in Mexico where that product has quickly grown.", "During the quarter we had a very strong launch of five new protective products at the Pack Expo Show in October.  These solutions have been very well received and we are enthusiastic about the potential for these systems to positively impact our business over the next few years.  As such, we\u2019re expecting an ongoing modest rate of recovery to continue in 2010 with stronger recoveries occurring in our regions outside of the United States and Western Europe.  ", "With the success in the businesses, we entered 2010 with good momentum, strong focus, leaner cost structure and a positive attitude ready to capture the opportunities that arrive from the economic recovery.  As such, we are guiding a full year EPS range of $1.48 to $1.68 or $1.50 to $1.70 if adjusted to exclude the $0.02 we expect to incur relating to the final stages of our GMS program in 2010.", "As we stated in our press release we are assuming a modest recovery with constant dollar sales growth between 4% and 6%.  We are also assuming that we may face an average mid single digit increase in resin prices during the year.  For foreign currency translations we have assumed the US dollar averages $1.43 per euro for the full year.  We have outlined a number of more mechanical assumptions that tie to our guidance range in our press release which I will not repeat here out of interest for time.", "I would like to remind everyone that in 2010 our fully diluted share count is expected to be 176.2 million shares.  Additionally, our current guidance does not factor in the payment of the W.R. Grace settlement as the exact timing of the settlement is still unknown.  However, the interest expense associated with the principle payment currently equates to approximately $0.01 per share of EPS on monthly basis.   As such, we will update our guidance once we have more definitive information on the Grace settlement.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details on our financial performance and our liquidity situation.", "David H. Kelsey ", "As our financial statements present, sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion.  Gross profit for the quarter increased 8% or $26 million to $334 million.  Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $12 million, gross profit would have increased 5%.  Our food packaging and protective packaging segments both increased gross profit $13 million compared to last year.  This improvement was despite lower sales volume as we benefited approximately $20 million from lower resin costs and benefitted approximately $10 million from our global manufacturing strategy or GMS and from our 2008 cost reduction program.", "Fourth quarter marketing, administrative and development expenses for the first time this year were higher than the comparable quarter in 2008.  This $32 million increase was largely due to a $30 million increase in incentive compensation.  Approximately one half of this amount was in the form of non-cash long term stock-based compensation related to the achievement of 2009 performance goals.  Our 2009 proxy statement explains in detail how these performance based awards are structured.  ", "Operating expenses were also impacted by $7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations.  Partially offsetting these amounts were benefits of approximately $5 million from our 2008 cost reduction program and from lower travel and entertainment expenses.  Operating profit was $128 million or 11.2% of revenue after adjusting for $5 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $9 million of GMS restructuring and non-recurring items.  ", "Another useful metric to measure operating performance is adjusted EBITDA which was 17% of net sales in the quarter compared to 15% last year.  Our calculation is shown in the supplementary information furnished with our financial statements.  We were able to achieve this increased level of adjusted EBITDA despite lower sales, the cost of the benefits from lower resin prices and the cost savings accomplished in 2009.  ", "Interest expense increased by $9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting additional interest of $16 million in the fourth quarter on two first half note issuances.  The 12% notes issued in February 2009 and the 7 7/8ths note issued in June 2009.  Partially offsetting the additional interest expense was a reduction of $8 million resulting from the maturity of our 6.95% note in May 2009 and the redemption of our 3% convertible notes in July 2009.  ", "Looking ahead to 2010, we are expecting interest expense to be approximately $160 million.  This amount reflects a full year of accrued interest on the W.R. Grace settlement.  There is still no date certain for the funding of the settlement however, if we were to fund the settlement on June 30th we would expect our interest expense to be approximately $20 million less or $140 million for the full year.  ", "Other income increased by $13 million in 2009 as compared to 2008.  This increase is primarily attributable to a foreign currency exchange gain related to the repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2009.  Next, I\u2019d like to summarize the cost and benefits of two of our key programs.  First, the cost reduction in productivity program we announced in July 2008, reduced employment by approximately 900 positions or 5% of our workforce from the June 30, 2008 levels.  We realized approximately $40 million of incremental savings in 2009 and $55 million overall from this program.  These savings were split almost equally between cost of sales and operating expenses.  ", "From a cash flow perspective we made cash payments of approximately $37 million in 2009 primarily for termination benefits.  We expect to make the remaining payments totaling $7 million by the end of the second quarter of 2010.  Substantially all of the 2009 and 2010 payments were charged to earnings in 2008.", "Second, we recorded charges of $16 million in 2009 related to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy.  These charges were split almost equally between our cost of sales and restructuring charges.  Our incremental benefit for the full year was approximately $20 million and we remain on track to realize additional incremental benefit of $10 million in 2010.  This would bring our cumulative benefit to $55 million in 2010 and thereafter in line with our expectations when we introduced this program in 2006 with its focus on adding capacity in emerging markets.", "I\u2019ll conclude with some key balance sheet and cash flow items.  Our receivables declined $16 million from December 31, 2008.  Excluding $25 million of foreign currency translation and excluding the repurchase of $80 million of receivables included in our receivables securitization facility in December 2008, receivables would have decreased $121 million or 16%.  We did not utilize our accounts receivable securitization facility in the fourth quarter of 2009.  ", "We continue to be focused on our credit and collection efforts in the current economic environment and to date we have not experienced any material deterioration in our accounts receivable portfolio.  As evidence of the diligence of our collection team, our days sales outstanding were five days lower at December 31, 2009 than at December 31, 2008.", "Inventory investment at December 31st declined $95 million during the year.  Excluding $22 million of foreign currency translation, inventory would have declined $117 million on a constant dollar basis during the year.  This continues to be a coordinated effort involving sales, supply chain and customer service with support from finance and information systems.  Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents at December 31st was $966 million down $382 million or 28% from the end of December 2008.  This decrease is attributable to the record free cash flow we generated this year.", "At December 31st we had $695 million in cash and cash equivalents.  In addition, we continued to have access to nearly $700 million of committed borrowing capacity.  Free cash flow, one of our key metrics as a management team gets close attention.  As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated a record $500 million of free cash flow in 2009 compared to $253 million last year.  On a constant dollar basis reduced investment in both accounts receivable and inventory contributed to our impressive year-to-date free cash flow performance.", "Capital investment in 2009 was lower than in recent years as work was largely completed on the three new plants we opened in emerging markets as part of our GMS program.  Our total capital investment in 2010 as Bill indicated is expected to be in the range of $80 to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects.  This level of investment is consistent with our spending before commencing our GMS investments in 2006. ", "Finally, our current available liquidity and projected free cash flow positions us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W.R. Grace settlement should it become payable in the next 12 months.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William V. Hickey ", "Operator can we now open up the call to questions from the participants and we\u2019ll follow up with any text questions from our webcast participants as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Bill, I wanted to ask you as we look out to 2010 you\u2019ve given us some broad parameters, we appreciate that, how do you see the mix of your business changing by product line?  You\u2019ve given us obviously the geographic mix it will be growing more quickly in emerging markets but how do you see the mix of business changing perhaps relative to 2009?  And, are there currently within your business any product lines that are diverging from what is the current normal trend within any one of the geographies that we should be aware of?", "William V. Hickey ", "Let me look.  I would expect that in 2010 we will see some recovery in our protective business.  You can see that protective really declined relative to food in the 2009 period primarily due to the impact of the economy on the industrial sector.  As 2010 recovers even though it may be a gradual recovery, as I said during my prepared comments, we\u2019re continuing to see sequential growth in the protective side of the business.  The CT-301 which also serves the industrial sector has got a great cost benefit environmental study so I do see protective coming back up to more its historical percentage of the company.", "As I said also that geographically I fully expect that the US economy will painfully adjust to consumer spending dropping from 70% of GDP down to something in the high 60s and that will result in I think faster growth outside the US which we\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter.  The fourth quarter numbers I felt were very impressive outside of the US with double digit growth in the emerging markets.  ", "If I look at products within the groups that may diverge regionally or in total I\u2019d say the CT-301 is probably a positive one because it\u2019s got a cost benefit environmental green story and it is also a new patented technology which should give us a leading position for a fair amount of time.  The other one is the Ethafoam business which really is depending on more the tech sector and the computer sector and that probably will not come back as quickly although I\u2019m hopeful.  I do think the Ethafoam HRC to the extent that we can over a 65% plus recycled product with both the performance of Ethafoam type products with the cost and environmental benefits of being made from high recycled content, I\u2019m optimistic that will turn upward a little more than we may have in our plan.", "The other one that\u2019s running a little differently is the food service sector which is really in our food solutions business.  That one has challenges in consumers eating out, getting back to the habits of eating out.  I watched the news this morning at the gym how one family was preparing their dinner meals for eight years ahead of time so they could manage their budget and eat out less but that would be the only product that may diverge from my overall outlook.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Ghansham Panjabi \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Can you comment on the pricing pressure on the protective packaging business?  Is there a specific set of products that maybe you\u2019re seeing outside pricing pressure and does it vary by geography?", "William V. Hickey ", "It varies by geography absolutely.  There\u2019s different competitive profiles in the protective business around the world and the different technologies.  But the place you\u2019ll probably see the most competitive environment is really where there is excess capacity on a global basis is what I\u2019ll call thin foams which is a very thin white foam sheets that are used to wrap materials, you\u2019ll see it sometimes wrapped around furniture.  That suffers from two factors, one is the capacity in the marketplace and the other is a lot of the end use markets are under pressure so that\u2019s the combination.", "You do see a little bit of pressure on the mailer side but some of the things we are doing there to offset that are quite attractive.  That\u2019s overall and I\u2019d say it depends probably Europe is the most competitive, US is probably second and the rest of the world probably tails off after that.", "Ghansham Panjabi \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Just as a follow question Bill, the Ethafoam product that uses up to a minimum of 65% recycled materials, how does the manufacturing cost compare to the product using virgin raw materials?", "William V. Hickey ", "I don\u2019t want to do the math for you but you know the price of virgin and you can configure the price of recycled and it\u2019s a good deal for the customer and for us.  It\u2019s really a technological breakthrough that our process engineers have developed to enable us to put that high of recycled content in a foam product and have the performance characteristics that you need to protect the fragile electronic items.  But, I\u2019d rather not go in to the details Ghansham.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Claudia Shank Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan Securities.", "Claudia Shank Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "I was hoping you could just comment quickly on the range of guidance for the full year of 2010 and maybe what\u2019s driving the variance between the low end and the high end, is it mostly volume or other things that would drive coming in at the low end versus coming in at the high end?", "William V. Hickey ", "It\u2019s mostly volume.  We\u2019ve actually talked about whether it\u2019s the US, it\u2019s how confident are we in the strength of the US recovery.  If it\u2019s a very tepid recovery we\u2019re probably at the lower end of the range, if it\u2019s a reasonable recovery, it doesn\u2019t have to be a robust recovery it just has to be a reasonable recovery and I think that would move us along to the upper end of the range.  So really forecasting the outlook for the US economy, I\u2019m more confident about economies outside the US but the US economy is still 45% of our business so that\u2019s probably the principle factor.", "Claudia Shank Hueston \u2013 JP Morgan Securities", "Then just as a follow up, what\u2019s your level of confidence around sort of developed Europe markets?  Obviously, you\u2019ve seen good strength in the emerging markets but what about the developed European markets?", "William V. Hickey ", "The developed European market is a challenge.

", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I wondered Bill if you could help us understand this weakness that you mentioned in the food packaging equipment sales over in Europe, how big a drop this was kind of either year-over-year or sequentially?  Then, whether this drop off is going to alter growth rates in Europe over the next few years?", "William V. Hickey ", "Well, the drop off has been in the 20% type range.  Customer investments in food packaging equipment it\u2019s an economic cycle issue.  The countries where we have seen relatively large investments are basically Spain has been a big investor over the years and has dropped off quite significantly as unemployment in Spain has hit 18%.  But, it\u2019s a little bit better in the fourth quarter it was down about 12% and I think as confidence returns customers will be more inclined to invest.  I think the equipment cycle and our food customer bases have very similar equipment cycle in most industries.  In good economies people are confident to invest, in bad economies people are cautious.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Then just as a follow on with food packaging, there\u2019s been more talk about BPA the last two or three months, is there anything in the Sealed Air portfolio food packaging that has BPA content?", "William V.

Then the opposite was true of our expectations for D&A was a little lower than we thought and so I am just trying to extrapolate in to 2010 if there\u2019s anything unusual about the quarter that should be extrapolated to the year?", "David H. Kelsey ", "Peter, I\u2019ll try to expand on the press release and the comments in our script and I\u2019ll do the D&A part first.  There are two things in depreciation and amortization, there\u2019s the traditional depreciation of our plant and equipment which I think was around $155 million in \u201909 and we expect to climb to about $160 million in 2010.  The other item that gets reported there is the amortization of our stock awards which are non-cash award so it doesn\u2019t get treated in the normal expense categories but rather gets treated as an amortization amount and we have split that out separately in the supplementary information to our financial statements.  ", "The number in 2009 I believe was around $38 million and we\u2019ve rounded that off to $40 million in thinking about what it might be next year.  So we don\u2019t see a big change up or down in that expense next year.  That is really what is driving the fourth quarter increase in our SG&A spending because that D&A line is consolidated in to our total SG&A spend.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie Capital.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Just a question on the 2010 outlook, you mentioned resin prices the expectation up mid single digits this year.  I guess that sounds like it has the potential to be a decent headwind.  In terms of pricing where are you at there?  Is this a potential at the current pricing levels to be a pretty big headwind starting in the first quarter?  Can you just comment on that?", "William V. Hickey ", "Well, if you go back two years, double digit increases quarterly were kind of the norm if you remember and mid single digit is probably more easy to adjust but we\u2019re looking at $0.04 on average out of a resin spend of fairly sizeable amount.  It would be a little bit of a headwind but I think we\u2019ve gotten our tools sharpened from the experience we had in the 2007/2008 period as we watched petrochemical feed stocks follow oil up to $140 a barrel.  So oil in the $70 range I think becomes a manageable exercise.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "So is your outlook then assuming flat price versus cost?  Knowing that resin is going up are you baking in a headwind?  Can you just help us on what your outlook is calling for relative to where current resin prices are? ", "William V.

Hickey ", "We are not baking in a headwind.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Then last on the 2010 outlook the follow up is as you mention the emerging markets growing faster than the developed markets with the GMS strategy pretty much put in place, are there differentials and margins at this point between the emerging markets and the developed markets that we need to think about?", "David H. Kelsey ", "There is certainly a differential as we build those facilities up to full capacity so we\u2019re not at even our 2010 projections going to be at full capacity that we have stretched across all the emerging markets so there is more potential there to leverage our fixed investment.  But I will add on an overall basis that our expectations for incremental operating income coming in large part from emerging markets compared to our incremental revenue is an expansion on the operating income margins we achieved in 2009.

Can you eliminate some costs, some plans, some capacity?  Can you touch on what you can do there?", "William V.

I do think that the European cost structure in general tends to be higher and you\u2019re absolutely right there are things we can do.  For example, one of the GMS programs which we announced in the fourth quarter was reducing production at one of our facilities in Germany where we\u2019re able now to produce that product for other parts of the world at a lower cost.  So we are doing that.", "I think also Dave may have mentioned earlier in 2009 that we had a European optimization program.  We were looking at the various components of our cost structure in Europe particularly a term we call cost to serve.  That is in progress on its way and that will bring our European cost structure more in line.  You do have the ongoing challenges, there are 14 countries and each has their own accounting system and tax system so you do have to work your way around what is perhaps maybe a less efficient system in other parts of the world where you can reach large population groups with one structure.

We have over the course of the GMS program announced the closure of two facilities namely our Canadian facility, part of which we moved in to our Rochester facility and last year a facility in Cedar Rapids Iowa.

There\u2019s an ongoing project there but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see anything like that and in fact we could see some growth in support of our top line growth.  The same thing in accounts receivable, we had significant efforts to bring that investment down and we at this point view ourselves as leveling out.", "So if you look at cash coming from operations less our capital spending I think you would get in to that low to mid $300 million range if you assume we\u2019re not going to get any incremental improvement from working capital which was well over $100 million in 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Naya \u2013 UBS.", "Joseph Naya \u2013 UBS", "I was just wondering if you could offer any comments about what is going on in export markets in particular kind of from Latin America to Europe?  Have there been any developments or changes there?", "William V. Hickey ", "Was that export markets of any particular products or in general just so I can put the right perspective on it?", "Joseph Naya \u2013 UBS", "Well I was thinking protein markets specifically but just kind of generally what you\u2019re seeing out there in the marketplace?", "William V. Hickey ", "Well I do think in Brazil the exports are kind of down but my own hope is that they will come back up.  The reason they\u2019ve been down is because of the strength of the Real in Brazil has really given Brazil a little bit of a competitive disadvantage than what they\u2019ve had before.  We\u2019re still hopeful that protein exports from the US will go up particularly to Asia.  I know there are negotiations ongoing now with the Japanese about raising the age limit from 19 months to 21 months.  So overall increases from other countries particular to Asia and decrease in Brazil primarily due to currency.", "Joseph Naya \u2013 UBS", "Then I guess taking a step back can you offer any comments in terms of what you\u2019ve been seeing in your overall volume trends so far in 2010?", "William V. Hickey ", "In 2010?", "Joseph Naya \u2013 UBS", "Yes.", "William V. Hickey ", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve said anything about it and I really don\u2019t have anything to say right now.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Analyst for John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Analyst for John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I just wanted to see if you could comment on what you expect the magnitude of the Venezuela impact to be in 2010?  You mentioned that in your guidance?", "David H. Kelsey ", "It\u2019s a bit of a moving target as I think those who have been following the situation down there that developed down there earlier this month as to what the actual exchange rate will be relative to converting our profits in Venezuela back in to US dollars.  But, worst case scenario we\u2019re talking about something that will be no greater than $10 million and right now we\u2019re not sure there will be an effect of more than $1 or $2 million.  So it is still an open issue for us but it is not nearly the material impact that you\u2019ve seen from some other companies that have come out recently with press statements.", "William V. Hickey ", "Operator before we go back to second round on the telephone I have a couple of questions that have come in from the webcast and let me sort of go through those quickly.  The first question is in the press release we note there is a $200 million reduction in resin costs in 2009, is this total year-over-year decline or the effect of cost decline due to lower prices?  If the former, how much resin cost reduction is due to price versus volume?  ", "I\u2019ll try to be as simplistic as I can here.  The $200 million is on a price per pound basis and that is assuming constant volumes so that would be the price per pound, that would be the price variance.  Actually offsetting that was about $140 million impact due to lower volumes so essentially lower volumes absorbed a fair amount of the price impact on resin.  ", "Let me go to the next question, in 2009 Sealed Air achieved a 12% adjusted operating margin.  Do I see the company being able to achieve 15% target?  It is our target, it is our management target and we definitely are committed to achieving it and 2012 is a reasonable number if modest economic growth prevails over this period would be the caveat.  ", "The last question on the Internet is can I discuss our medical strategy at this time and comment on our progress and outlook for the growth of this business in China and the Far East specifically?  Our medical business is progressing well.  We are in the process of renewing our import license in China.  We are reasonably confident that we\u2019ll get that approval.  We know it could be a disruption in our supply chain should there be any delays in that but we are hopeful and we should know something there by the end of the first quarter early second quarter.", "We have actually seen 21% growth in our medical business in Asia in the fourth quarter.  The Far East specifically, we\u2019re beginning to reach customers in India and other parts of Asia so we are really looking to grow where the healthcare systems are improving and as people\u2019s standards of living improve there\u2019s more focus on healthcare.  That\u2019s kind of a quick summary of what our strategy is on Asia for the medical business.", "Let\u2019s go back we have two more questions on the telephone.  Let\u2019s try to cover those quickly and conclude our call thereafter.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Bill, two questions one triggered off of your answer to one of the text questions.   I think you mentioned that the effect of volume in 2009 was something like $140 million and if I do some rough math on what you said the volume change was in \u201909 that would suggest a decremental margin of at least 30% perhaps closer to 40%.  This year as we look out to 2010 and look at the implied guidance, it seems like you\u2019re using more like a 20% perhaps even lower amount of incremental margin off your core revenue forecast.  Are the international regions that much lower margin wise in terms of incremental?  Because if all you are doing is eating in to excess capacity I would think that frankly the margin would be higher.  ", "That\u2019s question one and question two, currently we are going through a process here in the states with US red meat consumption being flat to down.  It is to be expected at some point we would hope that that will recover.  Do you think that the fact that herd sizes are still declining might affect a recovery in consumption in red meat any time in the next couple of years or do you think that will be a secondary consideration?", "William V. Hickey ", "Let me ask Dave to take the first part of it just to follow the math.  ", "David H. Kelsey ", "George, to be honest I\u2019m not sure I can follow the math that you were describing for 2009.  I guess for starters are you talking about gross profit margin or operating income margin?", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "My sense is operating income because that is what I thought you referring to.  I don\u2019t want to get you too much in to the weeds here on the call but I think you said 7% or 8% volume decline this year so if I apply that to last year\u2019s revenue base that would give me a denominator and I\u2019ve got $140 million number that you threw out just before on the question so that would equate to a greater percentage than again by my math with the incremental margin would be this year.", "David H. Kelsey ", "We may need to take that offline with Amanda because I think if you make all the adjustments including for foreign exchange our reported operating margin increased barely substantially.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "But Dave there should be no foreign exchange effect because you gave it on a constant currency base when you\u2019re referring to volume.  But we can come back to it.  My guess is internationally if you\u2019re absorbing excess capacity that should be fairly profitable incremental margin, no?", "David H. Kelsey ", "Yes and on a going forward basis, and again this is where we need to compare calculations, if I look at the incremental revenue and incremental operating income for 2010 it\u2019s significantly above the run rate that we had in operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2009.  So I think we need to work through this in more detail because our takeaway is we are actually going to be improving our year-over-year margins through adding revenue back in to the system and getting operating leverage.  That is definitely part of the operating plan we have for 2010.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "What about in terms of red meat consumption relative to herd sizes, what do you think?", "William V. Hickey ", "George it is about a 2% decline depending on the forecast that you look at for 2010.  The number we actually look at more than just herd size is the feed lot because essentially to use the term that\u2019s the feeder to our business as opposed to the herd size and that number is probably down a little less than 2% but again, to the extent that we\u2019re sort of factoring in an increase of export out of the US that should keep US numbers for our business reasonable level or slightly down which we have factored in to our outlook.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just a couple of follow ups on margins, Bill can you talk a little bit about margin compression that we saw in food solutions in the quarter and whether you think those margins have stabilized now or whether you have a real opportunity to return them to kind of double digit levels next year?", "William V. Hickey ", "There are two factors that hit food solutions actually the quarter versus the year but one in the year there was a particular customer claim for several million on that hit to food solutions business for segment reporting.  That\u2019s in the full year\u2019s number.  The second item is that when we made the delta between the 2008 and 2009 incentive compensation food solutions was one of the businesses that was affected by that compared to the other businesses.  They were allocated to all of the businesses but particularly it\u2019s a component of that one. ", "The third is that the food solutions business has got several hundred million dollars of outsourced trades that go in to our case ready business and that\u2019s always a catch up since we\u2019re buying product and the price formulas there tend to lack a quarter.  So food solutions overall though less I paint too rosy of a picture, I think it\u2019s got a very, very positive outlook but it really is focused on the restaurant trade and the food service trade which has been disproportionally impacted by the consumer\u2019s not eating out as much and scaling back their consumption of kind of convenient and easy to eat and purchased foods for eating outside the home.  So the outside the home component is probably as much of an impact as anything else.", "Mark Wilde \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Then finally, in terms of the bigger picture operating margins, that 300 bips that you talked about picking up by 2012 should we understand that to be really just a volume question more than anything else?", "William V. Hickey ", "It is primarily a volume question, yes.  There\u2019s a fair amount of leverage in our P&L if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the couple of years and with the GMS program and the cost reduction program in the 2008/2009 period.  So with the investments in place, the capacity is there to leverage quite a bit.  It is cranking up the volume story which I think our team is really ready to do.  We\u2019re really ready to do.  We spent a couple of years getting the house in order and now we\u2019re out on the field and we\u2019re going to put some scores up on the score board.", "At this point we\u2019ve run slightly over time.  The questions were good but I\u2019d like to thank you for participating in our call today.  I hope you will all join us the rest of the day in celebrating the 10th annual bubble wrap appreciation day.  We\u2019re proud to have the golden opportunity to celebrate the 50th birthday of Sealed Air brand cushioning and it was the product that launched Sealed Air.  Additionally, we\u2019ll be celebrating Sealed Air\u2019s 50th anniversary as a company on February 25th, the date of our incorporation.  ", "Before we leave here I want to thank our customers, our partners, our shareholders and especially our employees.  Their hard work and sacrifice to rise to the challenges of the difficult economic environment in 2009 ultimately delivered the results and positioned us well to capture the opportunities that lay ahead.  As we look out to 2010 we look forward to building on our momentum, the results and the relationships that we\u2019ve established.

This call is being recorded. ", "Leading the call today William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After managements\u2019 prepared comments, they will be taking questions. (Operator Instructions)", "And now, at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating managements\u2019 outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. Our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-K which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. ", "And now, I will turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill.", "William Hickey", "", "Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. I am Bill Hickey, President and CEO of Sealed Air Corporation. With me on the call today in addition to Amanda, we have Dave Kelsey, our Chief Financial Officer.", "During today\u2019s call, I will be highlighting our business performance for the first quarter. Dave will then discuss details of our financial results. After Dave\u2019s remarks, we will take your questions both from the phone lines and via text on our webcast.", "This morning, we reported a 9% increase in our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.36. This figure excludes a $0.01 charge related to our global manufacturing strategy program, which we highlighted in our press release this morning. ", "We are pleased with our earnings growth as we recognize that we are in the early stages of an economic recovery and we are managing through higher resin prices both on a prior year and a sequential basis.", "Additionally, we generated comparable gross and operating profit margin versus last year. We achieved this to the benefits of not only favorable foreign exchange translation, but of higher volumes in new and existing products, strong growth in developing regions, stringent controls on operating expenses, and productivity improvements, which offset both on favorable resin costs and price mix.", "Looking at the top line, first quarter sales increased 1% on a constant dollar basis. However, volume growth was a major contributor which increased 4% overall, largely driven by 8% increase in our protective packaging segment in North America, a 4% increase in our food packaging segment in North America, and a 10% increase in Latin America in food packaging as well.", "Across all of our businesses, volume growth improved through the course of the quarter ending with solid March results. For example, using our protective packaging business, our sales in January were 99.6% of January 2009 as we still had not crossed the breakeven line in our recovery of the decline in sales from last year. February sales were a 103% of the comparable month into 2009 and March sales were 109% of comparable sales in March 2009. ", "We announced a price increase to be effective April 1st, so we didn\u2019t wonder whether some of the March increase resulted from the price increase. And we look at our April sales month to date and we are tracking a 108% of April 2009. And I am pleased to say that we were expecting this type of trending to continue for the rest of the year.", "Looking at volume trends in more detail, food packaging volumes increased 2%, largely driven by the 4% increase in North America and a 10% increase in Latin America that I previously mentioned. Our performance in both of these regions was above local animal production rates due to incremental volumes from new and existing customers and from new product expansion.", "In North America, most products benefited from positive volume growth. And interestingly, the primary volume driver was a 43% increase in equipment as customers started to reinvest in replacement equipment during the first quarter.", "Western European volumes remained weak due to prolonged economic weakness and very low consumer confidence levels. But on a bright note, we did see ongoing growth in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia, where we achieved double-digit volume increases.", "Food solutions had similar regional results led by a 6% increase in North America due to strong poultry case ready sales and ongoing product expansion, including a new star fresh film for fresh fish which was launched at a large multinational retailer in the first quarter.", "Additionally, food solutions had an 18% increase in the Asia-Pacific region due largely to growth in case ready and ready meals. Like our food packaging business, the food solutions team deserved the onset of recovery in all the regions, except Western Europe, where conditions remained weak. We did see strength in developing regions, again with very solid sales growth of greater than 50% in Russia due to strong case ready program in that country.", "Our vertical pouch packaging sales increased 2% which included 4% of favorable foreign exchange. On a constant dollar basis, vertical pouch packaging sales held relatively flat in North America and Latin America as we expanded into bakery and deli applications, while the restaurant industry starts to stabilize and recover.", "Before I touch upon our protected packaging results, I would like to mention that our food businesses continue to be recognized for their innovation that targets measurable value for customers and consumers.", "In the quarter, the 2010 Flexible Packaging Association Achievement Award recognized our marinated on-demand package with the highest achievement award and the Gold Flexible Packaging Achievement Award for Technical Innovation. This marks the second consecutive year that our Cryovac brand has received this award.", "Additionally, the team earned the Food Processing Magazine Readers\u2019 highest accolade for the seventh consecutive year and they were awarded the Readers\u2019 Choice Award as the Gold Supplier of Packaging Materials.", "Moving onto the protective packaging segment, this business drew more than half of the volume growth in the quarter, largely benefiting from improving economic conditions. When looking at their 8% volume growth versus the prior year, I am pleased to report that volumes were up in all regions, including 8% in North America, 3% in Europe, and double-digit increases in the developing regions with 10% growth in Latin America and 25% growth in Asia Pacific, where the modest recovery of export market and the manufacturing sector in countries like Mexico contributed to the increase.", "Volumes were also driven by good buy-in of our new products including the new CT-301 Shrink Film and our new paper base PackTiger Solution, FasFil. I should also note that although it\u2019s anecdotal, one our Midwest sales reps mentioned to me that he has noticed fuller parking lots at some manufacturing customers in the Midwest. He is having a harder time finding a parking space which indicates a real sense of pickup in that region which is also very encouraging for the economy.", "And in maintaining the pace for continued growth to protect the packaging launched Recycled Content Bubble Wrap, which uses a minimum of 50% pre-consumer recycle content. This product now offers the highest minimum recycle content for air, cellular cushioning products on the market. ", "Although, we usually don't talk about equipments separately, investors usually ask us about equipment trends as an indicator of future outlook and of customer confidence. Our numbers for the first quarter are good. Equipment sales are up approximately 14% in the first quarter over a very low first quarter 2009. Also, equipment backlog that is orders for equipment not yet built and shipped is up 90% from the depths of the recession at the end of the first quarter of 2009.", "Looking at consolidated price mix, we did see a $27 million or 3% decline in the quarter versus the prior year, which impacted all reportable areas. As we mentioned in our press release, price mix reflected the lag timing of food packaging contract price adjustments and a challenging year-over-year comparison.", "In most of our businesses the first quarter 2010 selling prices reflected lower late 2009 resin cost. This compares to first quarter 2009 selling prices which were higher reflected late 2008 peak risen prices. As resin prices rose again in the first quarter of 2010, our businesses quickly responded by announcing various price increases in North America and Europe, as well as targeted price increases in other parts of the world. These price increases focused on recovering the additional resin cost that we incurred and varied from 4% to 9% depending on the product and the region.", "Most of these price increases generally went into effect on April 1st and we expect to start seeing the benefits by the end of the second quarter 2010. ", "To wrap up before I hand the call to Dave, I would like to reaffirm our EPS guidance for the full year, which is $1.48 to $1.68 per share on a reported basis or $1.50 a share to $1.70 a share if adjusted to exclude a $0.02 charge related to our global manufacturing strategy program.", "As we navigate through the second quarter, we are continuing to show goods sales momentum and are benefiting from volume gains and a leaner cost structure. Combined with the expected future benefit of resin cost recovery, seasonality, the ongoing adoption of new products by our customers, the incremental volume that we have recently signed on, and our investments in growth, we continue to feel positively about the year ahead.", "As such, we continue to expect the full-year average constant dollar sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% of which volume will be the primary driver. Our release outlines our updated assumptions for resin cost increases. But as we noted, we feel that we are able to offset these increases with the benefits I noted a moment ago. Of course, volume and raw material price fluctuations are the primary factors that will influence how we perform within our range. ", "And now, I am going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?", "David Kelsey", "Thank you, Bill. As presented in the financial statements that accompanied our press release, sales were $1.100 billion for the quarter. Gross profit for the quarter increased 5% or $14 million to $300 million. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $14 million, gross profit would have been flat compared with 2009. ", "In the quarter, we experienced the positive impact of a $42 million increase in volumes across all of our reporting segments along with an estimated $15 million of benefits from supply chain productivity improvements including $2 million of incremental benefit from GMS like sourcing volumes from lower cost facilities in our developing regions. The offsets were in approximate $30 million increase in resin costs and an unfavorable price mix of $27 million. As Bill just noted, we faced a challenging year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. Both list price increases and formula price adjustments are amongst the actions to offset these higher resin costs. ", "First quarter marketing, administrative and development expenses increased to 6% or $9 million to $176 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $7 million, the expenses would have increased $2 million and remained flat as a percent of sales.", "Operating profit was $124 million or 11.7% of revenue. After adjusting for $7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, operating profit would have been relatively flat compared with 2009. On a reportable segment basis, our protective packaging segment reported a 16% increase in operating profit as compared to prior year, which was offset by a combined 5% decline in operating profit in our food businesses.", "Interest expense increased by $6 million in the quarter compared to 2009, reflecting additional interest of $11 million on two first half of 2009 note issuances. The 7-7/8% notes issued note issued in June 2009, which contributed to $8 million to the increase and the 12% notes issued in February 2009, which contributed $3 million. Partially offsetting this additional interest expense was the reduction of $6 million resulting from the redemption of our 3% convertible notes in July 2009, which contributed $4 million and the maturity of the 6.95% notes in May 2009, which contributed $2 million.", "As mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we are expecting interest expense to be approximately $160 million for the year. This amount reflects a full year of accrued interest related to the W. R. Grace Settlement. There is still no date certain for the funding of the settlement. However, if we were to fund the Grace Settlement on June 30th, we would expect our interest expense to be approximately $20 million less or an adjusted a $140 million for the full year.", "Other income increased by $7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase includes net foreign currency exchange gains of $6 million, primarily resulting from the favorable impact of the strengthening of some foreign currencies when we remeasured our intra-company loans in our intra-company receivables and payables. As a reminder, the US dollar was very strong a year-ago attributable to the flight-to-safety in global currency markets. ", "I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents declined $67 million in the first quarter to $628 million at March 31st. During the quarter, we repaid amounts outstanding on our European credit facility, paid our accrued 2009 annual incentive compensation, made an annual cash contribution to our profit sharing, and paid $19 million in dividend.", "Our receivables declined to $25 million from December 31st, 2009. Excluding $3 million of foreign currency translation, receivables would have decreased $22 million or 16%. This decline was largely in Europe and North America primarily due to our normal first quarter sales seasonality. As the economy recovers, we are continuing to focus on our credit and collections efforts and have successfully maintained the quality of our global accounts receivable portfolio.", "Inventory investment increased $33 million during the quarter with little impact of foreign currency translation. In the quarter, inventory levels were higher in North America and Europe mainly in our food businesses reflecting a buildup of inventories in anticipation of normal second quarter seasonality. Yet, net of cash and cash equivalents at March 31st was $955 million, down slightly from December 31st, 2009. Also at March 31st, we had no amounts outstanding under our global or European credit facilities or our accounts receivable securitization program. Our annual committed borrowing capacity was $750 million at March 31st. ", "As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated $97 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2010. This compares with a $160 million last year. The $63 million decline in free cash flow was primarily due to a decline in cash flow generated from working capital items. We still anticipate free cash flow to exceed $300 million this year.", "Capital investment in the first quarter was $9 million lower than 2009 as work is largely completed on our three new plants opened in developing regions as part of our GMS program.", "In today's press release, we did announce the investment in a new facility in Brazil for expanded capacity in that developing market. Approximately, $11 million for this investment will be included in our second quarter of 2010 capital investment. We anticipate additional modest investments next year and in 2012 related to this facility.", "Our total capital investments for 2010 is still expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million to be used for a combination of maintenance and growth projects. This range includes our recent investment in Brazil and is consistent with our annual investment before commencing our GMS projects in 2006.", "Our current available liquidity and our rejected free cash flow positions us to fund both our day-to-day operations and the W. R. Grace Settlement should have become payable in the next 12 months. ", "And now, I will turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William Hickey", "Great, thank you Dave. Operator, I would now like to open up the call to any questions from the participants and we will follow-up with any text questions that come in from our webcast participants as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions). Once again, as a reminder, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief related to follow-up question, so that more questions can be taken during the call today. And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks. Hi everyone, good morning. A couple of questions on food. First of all, can you give us the latest update Bill on herd sizes and how that might trend over the next two years and what it might mean for your demand within Cryovac? And the related question would be \u2013 and maybe you mentioned it earlier in the call, I had missed it, I was jumping on a couple of different calls, what\u2019s the latest trend in case-ready, specifically within North America and then more broadly around the world.

Dividends paid, I think Dave mentioned that is $19 million for the quarter. So that was one question from the webcast.", "Second question from the webcast is given the price increases in place to recover resin, when do you expect to be back to a normalized raw material spread assuming resins stay stable with April levels?", "I think that I sort of addressed that a little bit earlier on one of the earlier calls. We would expect a lot of that to roll through by most of it by the end of the second quarter. There will be a carryover into the third quarter.

And if you look at the Sealed Air business 20 years ago, 100% of the business depended on industrial packaging. And part of the moves we made in the 90s were to begin to reduce our reliable on industrial packaging as we went through some of the earlier recessions, knowing the impact that the industrial business is much more affected by the industrial. ", "So it was a couple of decisions we made is one was to diversify the end markets and two is become more global with being at the markets around the world, create opportunities in other segments. We recognized food early on as a diversification opportunity, starting with our interesting acquisition in the 80s where we obtained dry-lock absorbent pad for meat trays which really gave us a flavor of what happened in the food business, followed it up in the 90s with the acquisition of Trigon, which got us into the protein packaging business primarily in Asia Pacific and Europe, followed with Cryovac in 1998. And as we look for further end market opportunities, again using core technologies and core manufacturing capabilities, we see kind of the diversification into the medical business as being another logical step for couple of reasons. One being the aging population and the increase in demand for healthcare by older population, and two the more emphasis on healthcare in the emerging markets.", "So we see that as a growth opportunity and the opportunity has really been focused from our core competencies and basically Polymer Science and extrusion and the manufacturing. We may have a lot of end markets but a lot of the inputs and processes are similar. We continue to look about whether there is something else beyond industrial, food and medical, but right now we are focusing on the portfolio we have but thanks for asking the question.", "Okay, operator, I think we are about wrapped up. So I would like to thank everyone for your participation of the call today. As we continue to perform through the second quarter, we remain optimistic that the modest recovery we saw last quarter will continue to provide growth opportunities for us in the year ahead. This recovery combined with our growth strategies, our lean and expansive international network ongoing innovations and expanding customers relationships position us to accelerate our growth rates, expand margins and continue to deliver measurable value for our customers and stockholders. ", "And again, I would like to say I am really proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder and thank you for taking the time to listen to us today. ", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After managements' prepared comments, they will be taking questions. (Operator Instructions)", "And now at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us and our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com.", "We also discuss financial measure that do not confirm to US GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to US GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.", "And now I will turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill.", "William Hickey", "Thank you Amanda and good morning everyone. During today's call I will be highlighting our business performance for the third quarter and Dave will discuss details of our financial results. After Dave's remarks, we will take your questions both from the phone lines and from webcast participants using text-in questions.", "Earlier today we reported a 26% increase in our reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.43 and on an adjusted basis we achieved a 13% increase. Our third quarter sales showed ongoing improvement in end market demand and new business gained with our solutions across various applications and regions.", "Our consolidated sales increased 5% to $1.1 billion, with 5% higher volumes and 1% higher price mix. These gains were partially offset by 1% unfavorable foreign exchange. Volume performance improved in the quarter even as year-to-year comparisons were slightly more challenging.", "Our Protective Packaging segment led the growth with a 9% or $28 million increase, which represented over half of our volume growth in the quarter. Another bright spot was in our food business, where volumes rose 3%, largely driven by 5% increase in our food packaging business in North America and a 7% increase in that segments Latin American region. I should also note that equipment sales remained strong in all businesses, increasing 10% on a consolidated basis, but with a slightly note lower margin contribution. ", "Total company price mix turned the corner and was positive in the quarter, as earlier pricing actions and favorable contract adjustments yielded $11 million of benefits in the third quarter. Price mix was largely driven by a $14 million or a 3% increase in North America from our food businesses. These benefits were slightly muted by relatively flat price mix performance in the Protective packaging segment as that business has not yet received the favorable contribution from all of their pricing actions on a consolidated basis.", "Developing regions sales remained strong with an 8% growth, which included 3% favorable foreign exchange. This growth reflected an 11% increase in sales and our food packaging business and an 18% increase in Protective packaging sales, each of which include 3% favorable foreign exchange.", "Our reported developing region growth rate was muted by pre-buying that occurred in the first quarter as our medical customers in Asia built inventory ahead of our license renewal. Excluding our Asian medical sales to eliminate the pre-buying effect, our developing region sales would have increased 12%, which also includes a 3% favorable foreign exchange. Developing regions represented 16% of our third quarter revenue and we expect continued growth in these markets going into next year. ", "As for our medical business in Asia, I am please to report that we are granted a new license in mid September and our currently supplying exciting customers and our expanding our presences in that market today. Input cost remains substantially high in the quarter and were remissest of 2008 levels, as our average resin price was only lower by 2% sequentially, compared to the prior year period we recorded $25 million of higher resin cost in the quarter. ", "As price mix was positive in the quarter, we began the resin cost recovery in the third quarter and in combination with it, generated approximately $10 million of benefits from productivity improvements from our global manufacturing strategy and various cost savings and efficiency initiatives. We came close to achieving cost price priority in the third quarter. So we are definitely moving in the right direction and except to continue to recover resin cost in the fourth quarter and next year.", "Now I\u2019d like to walk you through some of the key highlights by business area. Food packaging businesses constant dollar sales growth of 4% reflected the growth factors that we outlined last quarter. North American beef production rose by approximately 3% in the quarter as compared to negative 2% production rates in the first half of the year.", "Additionally we benefited from increased demand for our equipment systems as customers continue to automate their operations; an on going success for piloting and commercializing the solutions in easy open and cook-in shrink bags globally. For example in Brazil, we continue to expand our market presence through merchandising programs targeted at the local Brazilian consumers.", "Price mix performance was also a favorable in food packaging, reflecting the benefits of both prior price increases and contract adjustments. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are anticipating ongoing growth due to expectations for solid holiday meat demand and increase in customer production rates in several regions of the world and a steady growth in US beef export demand, which is actually up 22% for the third quarter.", "As resin cost recovery remains a priority, the business has also announced targeted price increases, that some of which we implemented in the third quarter and reminder of which will be implemented in the fourth quarter. We also expect to continue to benefit from favorable contract price adjustments through year end.", "The food solutions business continued to experience improvement in the quarter with a 4% increase in price mix associated with benefits from prior price increases and contract adjustments. Additionally, the business achieved a solid 3% volume increase. North America also achieved solid growth driven largely by case-ready and vertical pouch packaging and I am pleased to say that all regions achieved volume growth in the quarter, as our solutions showed strong penetration in developing regions, although of a small sales base. ", "Looking at our key product families, our case-ready business sales were relatively flat this quarter overall. However, we saw a solid growth in North America, where sales increased over 15% as we continue to expand our market presences with new customers and new applications.", "For example, both our Mirabella lidstock and Tray Package and our Darfresh Vacuum Skin Package have been adopted by a number of retailers in the United States and Canada, and they\u2019re helping to withstand our case-ready presence in the market and across a variety of meat types.", "In Europe case-ready sales remained below last years levels, but showed sequential improvement with strength in Freshpizza and whole poultry applications. Additionally Mirabella sales are accelerating in the region as we have expanded our pilot test into large retailers and in growth application such as sea food.", "Our both liquid packaging sales led by our vertical pouch packaging portfolio increased 13% in the quarter, which included 70% favorable foreign exchange. We achieved the largest growth in North America, where sales grew over 15% due to strong equipment demand and improving food service industry conditions.", "We also had good success in other regions. In Europe we doubled our aseptic pouch sales in the quarter and are continuing to expand that products presence into Eastern Europe. I should also note that our ready meals portfolio, while smaller in comparison, continues to be rolled out at various retailers as food processors adopt our packaging solutions for their expanding ready-to-eat offerings.", "So in sum, through the balance of the year we continue to expect similar favorable volume and price mix trends in food solutions, as additional targeted price announcements in the third quarter will start to benefit the business in the fourth quarter.", "As you saw in our financials, the Protective Packaging segment continued to be the standout segment as the business provided over half of our increased volume. Its 9% volume growth was largely driven by 9% growth in North America and 8% growth in Europe, and I should also note that developing region volumes were up at the double-digit levels. ", "Second quarter trends held through the third quarter, where demand increased across all industries in North America, driven from both real demand and some restocking. The European market remained characterized by uneven recovery rates, while the Northern European countries represented the strongest rates of recovery and growth for us, with sales growing at double-digit rates to meet demand associated with higher industrial output and improved consumer confidence.", "As previously noted, price mix was relatively flat in this segment. With resin prices remaining high, the business has already announced targeted price increases, some of which were implemented in the third quarter and balance implemented in the fourth quarter in an effort to continue to recover resin cost.", "Shifting to our EPS guidance, we have narrowed our range from 20% range to a $0.06 range, is now $1.54 to $1.60 on a reported basis or $1.56 to $1.62 on an adjusted basis. This compares to our full year EPS guidance which was $1.48 to $1.60 on a reported basis. ", "Additionally we raised our effective income tax rate guidance to 28% from 27% as our regional guidance anticipated an extension of the U.S. R&D income tax credit that expired in 2009. If congress does pass and retroactively applied these tax credits, which are approximately $0.03 per share, then we expect to be in the upper end of our EPS range.", "Before I pass the call to Dave, I would like to re-affirm that we continue to anticipate ongoing recovery in our end markets in 2011 and are staying focused on innovation and bringing differentiated solutions and technologies to the market.", "Our upcoming participations in the Pack Expo International Exhibit next week in Chicago will showcase several new products in our pipeline, including the launch of Cryovac 360, which is an innovative multi-layered shrink sleeve solution for primary or multi-packed labeling; for example, around beverage bottles. We are excited about this solution as it allows us to expand into new markets with a higher performing and more sustainable solution than one that\u2019s available on the market today. ", "Additionally we will be launching our smart life initiative, which is an organization wide approach designed to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable packaging. We will also be highlighting how we are advancing our sustainability mission to our business strategy across our solutions and we will be updating our five year sustainability goals. ", "And now I am going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave.", "Dave Kelsey", "Thank you, Bill. Bill has already commented on the components of our sales growth. Given the year-over-year volatility of exchange rates, I would like to provide some further detail on foreign currency exchange. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, our sales were unfavorably impacted by $10 million from foreign currency translation as the Euro weakened against the U.S. dollar by approximately 11%.", "Our Euro denominated sales were in the high teens as a percent of total company sales. Year-over-year the unfavorable impact of the Euro was partly offset by the strengthening of our diversified basket of other currencies such as the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. ", "Gross profit for the quarter increased 3% or $9 million to $321 million. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of $3 million, gross profit would have been $12 million or 4% higher than 2009. Gross profit growth was largely driven by volume growth in our industrial businesses. ", "Also contributing to our higher gross profit were $11 million in favorable product price mix from our previously announced pricing actions in contract pricing adjustments, benefits realized from our supply chain productivity improvements and benefits from producing products in our new low cost facilities in developing region. These benefits were partially offset by approximately $25 million of increased resin cost compared to last year.", "Third quarter marketing administrative and development expenses decreased 4% or $7 million to $173 million. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $2 million, these expenses would have decreased $5 million. This decrease was due to lower provisions for variable incentive compensation expenses, as our year-to-date results were not achieving our compensation program targets fully.", "We continue to invest in new product developments and these costs are higher year-over-year. For the full year operating expenses are expected to be approximately 16% net sales at the lower end of our January guidance. Operating profit was $147 million or 13% of revenue on a reported and constant dollar basis. There was no year-over-year impact from foreign currency translation.", "On a sequential basis from the second to third quarter of 2010, operating profit increased to 12%. This growth was largely driven by 21% increase in operating profit in our food businesses due to the benefits mentioned earlier. You may have noticed in our financials that our tax provision increased to 28% from 24% last year. As Bill indicated, this was mostly due to the benefit of the utilization of some U.S. income tax credits, namely the R&D tax credit in 2009, but which expired and have not yet been renewed for 2010.", "I will conclude with some key cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash and cash equivalents increased $100 million in the third quarter to $762 million at September 30. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $21 million and used $20 million for capital expenditures for maintenance, sales growth and productivity improvements. ", "Our 12 year capital investment is still expected to be in the range of $80 million to $100 million. This range includes our second quarter investment and an additional manufacturing facility in Brazil and is consistent with our annual capital spending before commencing our GMS projects in 2006.", "Our receivables increased $49 million from June 30, 2010 on a reported U.S. dollar basis. Excluding foreign currency translation of $32 million which reflects a strengthening Euro in the quarter, our receivables increased $17 million, in line with our increased sales volumes. Based on an analysis of day sales outstanding and past due aging balances, the quality of our receivables remains good.", "Inventory investment increased $27 million during the quarter, excluding foreign currency translation of $22 million, also mainly due to the strengthening Euro in the quarter. Inventories increased $5 million, reflecting our seasonal trend in inventories, where we buildup inventory ahead of peak fourth quarter demand.", "Debt: Net of cash and cash equivalents at September 30 was $826 million down $96 million from June 30, 2010, mainly due to the accumulation of cash and cash equivalents in the quarter. Also at September 30 we had no amounts outstanding under our global or European credit facilities or our accounts receivable securitization program. Our available committed borrowing capacity was over $750 million at September 30.", "As shown in the supplementary information furnished with the financial statements, we generated $206 million of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year. This reflects an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on our working capital items of approximately $20 million. Historically, our first and fourth quarters are the strongest quarters for generating free cash flow. We continue to expect free cash flow to exceed $300 million in 2010.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William Hickey", "Thank you, Dave. Operator we now like to open up the call to any questions from the participants and we'll follow-up with any text questions from our webcast participants as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please proceed sir.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks. Hi everyone, good morning.", "William Hickey", "Good morning George.", "George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America", "I guess my first question is around pricing. As I recall from earlier in the year and even last year, the company I think stated that it would be a bit more aggressive and timely in raising prices to offset inflation in input costs. ", "We talk about global manufacturing, we talk about new products, we talked about emerging markets, but at the end of the day it seems to me that getting resin pass-through still winds up being the biggest thing that we talk about or that you talk about in your press releases. So from here on now, why should we expect that you will be more aggressive in passing through resin when you have very little that we could see in protective packaging in the third quarter?", "William Hickey", "There are a couple of things in protective George just to point out. One is, the European price increase went into effect on September 1 and Europe actually had a resin increased earlier than kind of North America. North America had their resin price increases and resin price increases actually didn\u2019t occur until really the last month of the quarter. So we are out there within 30 to 45 days of the increase with all price increases, kind of the second and the numbers aren\u2019t clear here, because we have this item called price mix.", "And on the protective business, one of the largest single growth products was the inflatable product line, which grew about 16.9%, and that does have a lower margin than the rest of the protective business. So that is appearing in the price mix column. It\u2019s appearing as you are attributing it to price, but it\u2019s actually a mixed component of it. If you take that out the number\u2019s essentially flat. So it does have an impact when you folks look at price mix.", "And I think the third item was there were some rebate adjustments in the quarter and that occurs when customers hit certain volumes, they hit certain rebate levels. So you put all of those together, I think getting our price increases out quicker is something we have done. The price mix, the mix component of it, obviously we\u2019ve got to find a better way to communicate that to you and kind of rebates just happens during the year.", "So those were essentially the three components, and you will see with Europe, that Europe actually had only one month of price increase, the U.S. really didn\u2019t have any months of it, but again the U.S. price increase, cost increases were occurred at the very end of the quarter. So the answer is we are more aggressive. I think 30 to 45 days is pretty reasonable, which is a lot faster than Sealed Air had historically done and it will always be a 30 to 45 day lag George.", "George Staphos - Bank of America ", "Okay. Bill, I appreciate that. I guess the follow-on I had, you had mentioned that you will effectively offset this, that\u2019s my wording not yours, but I thought that\u2019s what you were saying, by the fourth quarter, but you also said into 2011; so again around the same theme. Why would it take into 2011 to offset the input cost pressures you\u2019ve seen? Thank you.", "William Hickey", "I will just say, it\u2019s about to be conservative there. I mean, the price increases kind of roll through, and I sure like to target it all through the end of this year, but we just gave ourselves a little way.", "George Staphos - Bank of America ", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Matt Wooten \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Good morning. It\u2019s actually Matt Wooten sitting in for Ghansham. How would global beef price increases and changes in consumption effecting the volume distribution across your food business?", "William Hickey", "We haven\u2019t seen that much of an effect. I mean interestingly enough, beef is actually up in the third quarter versus the first half, even though prices are up somewhat. U.S. exports are up, primarily on actually the strength of the Australian dollar, which actually has opened up markets to U.S. beef competitively that Australia had previously supplied and if you ask the questions about Australia, Australia beef exports are actually down.", "But as far as your question on beef consumption related to prices, we haven\u2019t seen much of an impact in overall consumption. We\u2019ve seen it shift around the world. Brazil because of the strength of currency is actually consuming more beef at home than export, but that\u2019s probably the best I can give you right now as flavor of things around the world.", "Matt Wooten \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then a follow-on if I could. There\u2019s been quite a lot of M&A activity in the plastic packaging niche over the last 18 to 24 months. Has there been any impact until there and do you guys expect to be more aggressive on M&A in 2011?", "William Hickey", "We\u2019ve always been in net of acquiring in this industry and we continue to look for the right asset. So we\u2019ll see what happens.", "Matt Wooten", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls & Snyder. Please proceed.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Ingalls & Snyder", "Good morning all.", "William Hickey", "Good morning.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Ingalls & Snyder", "Bill, the reason for your guidance, I understand you are narrowing the ranch, but what was in your assumptions that would have gotten you either to $1.70 and have changed, which will only get toward the high end, to $1.62?", "William Hickey ", "Well, I think a lot of it was more stable resins. I mean, if you look earlier in the year, most projections were flat resin through the balance of 2010. The increases that occurred at the end of the third quarter, the $25 million that Dave referred to in his comments was not there when we did the earlier guidance in the year, Rosemarie and we\u2019ve been pretty good on the outlook for volume, but a higher volume would have given us at the upper end, but I\u2019d say that the most significant piece has been the higher input cost that occurred that were not in the original outlook.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay, that is helpful, and if I may, at 14.5% your food packaging margin is at its highest point. How high do you think it can grow as volume increases? What is some kind of a long-term goal on\u2026?", "William Hickey", "No, I think we\u2019ve said on numerous occasions that our goal for the company, and it would include each of the businesses were to get back to a 15% operating margin. So, that\u2019s our intermediate goal, that\u2019s what we are working towards and that\u2019s what we are aiming for.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Philip Ng -Jefferies", "Good morning guys. Just a quick question on the protective packs and business volumes have been really strong, but comps start to get a little tougher now in Q4 and next year. So I just wanted to get a feel for what kind of outlook you have in the volume from for Q4. I mean as we look at 2011 what\u2019s the normalized run rate going forward?", "William Hickey", "Well, we are still looking for I\u2019d say mid to high single digits as you look forward. That\u2019s sort of where we see that business over kind of the intermediate term, and the economy\u2019s been holding up. I know there\u2019s always been a concern about the possibility of a slowdown later in the year or double-dip, but right now the numbers we see don\u2019t show a double-dip, and if there is a slowing down from the 9%, we are saying from the mid to high single digit.", "Philip Ng -Jefferies", "Okay. And I guess bigger picture just from. When you look at your portfolio products longer term, are there any areas that you wanted to get bigger in or you think there is a Board from a technology standpoint or material from a geographic perspective?", "William Hickey", "I can get bigger everything. Yes, but I do think we will increase our presence in medical. I do think, one of the things you\u2019ve heard me say a number of times is more the business will continue to be outside the U.S. The Asian business if you look at the components, I mean, in protective business and China was up 23% and the food business in China was up 31%. So those are the parts of the world that will get a bigger share of our attention and our sales growth.", "Philip Ng -Jefferies", "Okay. Alright, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Magers of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning. I have a quick question regarding, actually just a piggyback off of George\u2019s question on the protective packaging volumes in the quarter. Was there any kind of pre buy, given that the price increase that happened in September? I mean how did the volumes trend throughout the quarter?", "William Hickey", "Yes, actually I think July was probably our slowest month of the quarter. July was actually probably our slowest month of the quarter. August got a little bit better, September got a little bit better, but the price increase in September 1 wouldn\u2019t have affected the quarter. So you have the back-to-school effect so to speak, but I wouldn\u2019t see any pre-buying in Q3.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, and then on the CapEx, I mean as you get closer to the end of the year, where do you expect to really come in regarding the CapEx range of $82 million, because if we keep on trend that you have been going on, through the balance, I mean through the beginning three quarters of the year, you\u2019ll probably end around $80 million, which is the bottom end of the range. So, is there anything that you have done so far in Q4 or that you\u2019re expecting to do in Q4 that would lead us to assume otherwise?", "William Hickey", "Dave?", "David Kelsey", "It is a little incomplete of the things that we would get $40 million out the door by December 31, but there are a number of growth projects that we will be evaluating through investment, but those dollars are more likely to actually get spend in 2011. So, from a guidance perspective, it is realistic to trend us to the lower half of the range.", "Sara Magers \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great wonderful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Rick Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Just like to ask a question about case-ready and specifically what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint in case-ready? We are understanding that there is a competitor out there with a product that helps to maintain the color of the meat. So just wondering how you are seeing the competitive dynamic in that business?", "William Hickey", "We really haven\u2019t seen anyone in the marketplace. We still think we have the leading role in case-ready, both the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Asia and we really haven\u2019t seen any significant competitor in the marketplace.", "Rick Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just maybe shifting. Can you just give us a better sense of how your new product pipeline looks currently?", "William Hickey", "I think the new product pipeline looks pretty good. I know I mentioned during my prepared comments that we will be participating in the International Pack Expo Exhibition in Chicago next week; it\u2019s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and we will be exhibiting at least five new products that have not been seen before, which would be pretty exciting. So if anyone is in Chicago, you are welcome to contact Amanda and we will be happy to show you what we are showing to our customers.", "Rick Skidmore \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili of Macquarie, please proceed.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Hi. Thanks and good morning.", "William Hickey", "", "Good morning.", "Al Kabili \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Just a question if you could help us clarify on this price increases in the Euro protective packing. Just even if you can give us a flavor of the average overall magnitude of those price increases? And then secondly, in terms of where you need to take pricing to recover the resin cost inflation, what percentage does that put you there in terms of what you\u2019ve got in September that you mentioned? Thanks.", "William Hickey", "", "Yes, Europe price increases were September 1 and those were probably mid single digits and the North America is also mid single digits. And if you look at our top line numbers and your looking and saying we\u2019re going to recover $25 million in resin, it doesn\u2019t take too many percents of the $41.5 billion or $1 billion plus a quarter to kind of get you there.", "Al Kabili -- Macquarie", "Okay, fair enough, but the second question I suppose is on specialty resins. Could you comment on what you are seeing on the cost front on specialty resins, if you\u2019ve seen up-tick recently there? Thank you.", "William Hickey", "Yes, the specialties have ticked up a little bit, the specialties ticked up a little bit, obviously not as dramatically as the commodities which go up $0.05 and $0.06 at a time, but they have sort of tick-up, slightly over the last few months.", "Al Kabili - Macquarie", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gil Alexander of Darfil Associates. Please proceed.", "Gil Alexander - Darfil Associates", "Good morning. As you look in to the future, would you have a rough idea what your capital expenditures could be in the 2011, 2013 period?", "William Hickey", "Gil, it\u2019s great to hear from you, it\u2019s been a while, but let me let Dave answer that question.", "David Kelsey", "I think there\u2019s been a bit of a circular answer to that. It really depends on the growth rates we see in some of the new platforms. The $80 to $100 million range that we have for our guidance this year is a good baseline for the business on a going forward basis. That covers both maintenance CapEx and sufficient incremental capacity to support mid single-digits growth rate in our core products, to the extend that we have higher growth in emerging markets or we started to get some real traction in some of our new growth platforms, then that amount would have to be ratcheted up.", "So the next time to sort of check in on that would be at the end of January, when we give our guidance for next year. We\u2019ll have a much better handle on the investment requirements for some of those growth platforms. So you\u2019ll see that both in our revenue projections and in the capital required to support those revenue projections.", "William Hickey", "Okay, operator.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Thank you, good morning.", "William Hickey", "Good morning.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "I was trying to better understand the relationship between your organic sales and your margins. If I look on a year-over-year basis, your food solutions had the best year-over-year margin improvement and yet it had the slowest organic growth rate. I guess I would have expected protective packaging with a much faster organic growth rate to have better margin up-tick from the contribution margins. Can you help me to understand those relationships?", "William Hickey", "Yes, I\u2019ll try to do it is simple as I can, but basically mixes a big component of that. In food solutions, I\u2019ll start with that one, is a lot of that business contains outsource trays. I think you\u2019ve heard us telling the story before, is that for our case-ready product we don\u2019t manufacture the trays for most of the offering and we actually outsource the trays and those are made of a different material, those are styrene.", "", "As tray sales have gone down somewhat and film sales have gone up, they\u2019ve really given a favorable mix component to the price mix on food solutions. So they kind of benefited more from the mix than the price side and food solutions also had price increases in July, so they got the full benefit of that for the quarter. ", "On protective, we got price increases going in September and afterward and those benefits will kind of follow. So you\u2019ve got a mix effect and a timing effect, but I understand where you are coming from, but they are two different businesses. On an apples-to-apples basis, organic growth and protective and compared to food solution at constant raw material cost, protective would be higher, yes. ", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Okay yes. And just lastly if I could Bill, how significant is the pending Grace settlement as you think about your business. Has this held you up from strategic steps or actions you might consider or once the settlement comes and goes is it really a businesses usual until there?", "William Hickey", "Well, it\u2019s been somewhat of a weight on our shoulders sort to speak. It\u2019s obviously, it\u2019s a question investors ask. I know we frequently get questions. Now obviously as the times gone on and the settlements come closer, in the view the number of questions have gone down, but in the early years of this nine year odyssey, there was always concern that Sealed Air would be dragged back in the court.", "So I do think it\u2019s been an overhang on the company. I think, it\u2019s been somewhat of an overhang on our ability to raise capital at some point in time. Again though that\u2019s probably gone down as the settlement has gotten closer, and it\u2019s got a negative effect on our earnings as we spent a good bit of our cash flow for the last several years investing in asset on the balance sheet called cash, so we make the payment and the negative arbitrage on that is about $0.12 to $0.14 a share.", "So yes, we feel very good when this is finally over, and as we said in our press release, it will result in a $0.12 to $0.14 per share pick up in earnings per share, just from eliminating the negative arbitrage on the balance sheet, as well as freeing up our future cash flow for investment in the business or paying down debt or returning cash to shareholders.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "We certainly look forward to the settlement. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please proceed.", "George Staphos - Bank of America.", "Thanks. I got to jump back on. I wanted to the piggyback off Pete\u2019s question there. Bill, is your read on the ramification and benefits to you still the same as was the case back really in the decade that went. Great stuff come out of bankruptcy, if $0.001 forever resolves whatever issues you might have with great deployments?", "William Hickey", "Yes, I think the settlement that we mentioned years ago essentially give us the protection of 524G, which is a code provision that directs any claims related to a specialist, to the trust, and away from the company that has that protection. So yes, we still believe that is the case.", "George Staphos - Bank of America.", "Okay. Now the related question to that is, Bill again from my advantage point anyway, it doesn\u2019t look like you need any more capital, but rather you probably got too much. Now again that\u2019s our view not necessarily your. Could we see something more structural more significant in return of capital back to you various constituencies once this occurs?", "William Hickey", "George, I really wouldn\u2019t want to speculate as to what we might do right now.", "George Staphos - Bank of America.", "Okay, but it is one of the options that you\u2019d be considering presumably?", "William Hickey", "There are many, many options.", "George Staphos - Bank of America.", "Okay, I\u2019ll leave that to the side. The last question and I\u2019ll turn it over. Within food, could you see, could we see an accelerated pick up and demand for your packaging relative to what ranchers and freelance operators are seeing right now in terms of feed cost and margins on cattle. I guess the point being margins go down, you see accelerated slaughter, at least a short-term pick up and demand for your product, but longer-term it stunts the cattle cycle again or do you think we should have a normal cycle from here on as going forward? Thanks. Good luck on the quarter.", "William Hickey", "", "No, actually George that\u2019s an excellent question. I just read yesterday afternoon, sort of an update on the cattle look, and actually the near term outlook is more cattle coming to market, probably at the expense of 2012 and some of 2011, mostly 2012. So if feed costs remain high more cattle will come to market sooner and that will be sort of a little bit of a gradual dip through the 2012 period and will built back again in 2014. So now the differences are plus or minus a couple of points. So they are not dramatic difference, but 1% increase in cattle coming to market, it means a lot to us.", "George Staphos - Bank of America.", "", "Especially when you look at the margins that you\u2019re making your food packing business are raw, but I appreciate the color and good luck in the quarter again guys. Thank you.", "William Hickey", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf of S&P Equity, please proceed.", "Stewart Scharf \u2013 S&P Equity", "", "Good morning. Would you be able to give any comments on the Venezuela and any impact from some of the events with Sharvez (ph) nationalization operation and what percentage of your business comes from Venezuela?", "William Hickey", "", "I think it\u2019s about 3%.Dave\u2019s got some more updated numbers, but it\u2019s about 3% of our business. Dave, do you want just to give\u2026", "David Kelsey", "", "It\u2019s probably in the ballpark $20 million to $25 million in annual revenue.", "Compared to the other company who was in the news earlier in the week it\u2019s a much more modest percentage of our consolidated net earnings, less than 5% of our consolidated net earnings.", "So, given the nature of our business where we import semi finished product into the country, and then finish it towards customer specifications , I don\u2019t know that we would necessarily see a cutoff in our sale to Venezuela, may just be a case of selling more finished product into the country as opposed to semi finished product.", "So, we certainly been watching things closely there, not just in last three days, but the last several years given the volatility of exchange rates and the challenging economy. But we do serve primarily the food industry; it\u2019s been a business we\u2019ve managed successfully over multiple decades and we continue to expect to have a profitable business in Venezuela.", "Stewart Scharf \u2013 S&P Equity", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "William Hickey", "Now, Catherine, we\u2019ve got one more question here on the telephone, and then I will look at the webcast.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Sara Magers of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thank you for taking my follow-up. I just have one, and it\u2019s regarding resin. What are your assumptions for resin implied in your guidance, are you in order to get integrityin Q4, does resin prices have to say about where they were in September. I am just kind of looking for a range and what you\u2019ve\u2026?", "William Hickey", "I think our outlook right now is pretty flat for the rest of the year. So as in terms of where we are right now, the increases that have occurred should continue through the rest of the year.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. So, flat and \u2026?", "William Hickey", "Right, flat.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities", "Wonderful. Great, thank you very much and good luck in the quarter.", "William Hickey", "Okay, thank you. I have a question from the webcast. Question is, is the company committed to achieving full investment grade credit ratings and what is the S&P waiting for? Completion of the [Inaudible] litigation or something else..", "I really don\u2019t think I can comment on what any of the rating agencies, maybe waiting for, obviously that\u2019s a question they are more prepared to answer than we are. But we anticipate that when the Grace settlement occurs to the extent that it has been a cloud over the business. That the various rating agencies may take another look at Sealed Air and it\u2019s very possible they could decide to raise our rating to investment grade. ", "Obviously that\u2019s the decisions that would have to made by the rating agencies and I guess any questions will have to go to them, but thank you for the question. ", "At this point, operator, I think that concludes the questions and I would just like to make a few closing comments before we wrap up the call.", "I would like to thank everyone for your time and participation. Our business picked up momentum in the third quarter, which we feel will hold through the year end and into 2011. ", "The ongoing economic recovery, strong growth in developing parts of the world, which is supported by extensive lead footprint, focus on recovering input cost and our continued commitment to innovation and investment in a differentiated pipeline of solutions, remains our focus.", "We believe that strong execution and a balanced approach will continue to strive improved results and allow us to achieve our long-term goals and create value for all of our stake holders. ", "I'll reaffirm again, that I am proud and happy to be a Sealed Air shareholder and thank you for taking the time to listen to us today.", "David Kelsey ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you for joining today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Leading the call today, we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions] And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us, and our future performance may be different due to a number of factors, and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP, and you may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release today. ", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William Hickey", "Thank you, Amanda, and good morning to everyone. During today's call, I would like to discuss our 2010 business performance and then address our outlook for 2011 and outline our strategy for delivering ongoing growth. Once Dave and I have concluded our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take questions from both the telephone lines and from our webcast participants who can use text-in questions. ", "This morning, we reported our full year 2010 adjusted earnings per share of $1.60. This figure excludes a number of items which we highlighted in our press release. Our 11% growth in adjusted earnings was primarily driven by a solid 5% annual growth in volumes, $100 million in productivity benefits achieved through various global supply chain initiatives that leverage our world-class manufacturing practices and our Global Manufacturing Strategy program, as well as tight control of expenses. ", "Unit volume was particularly strong for us in the second half of the year and we achieved peak daily sales rates in the fourth quarter, showing 7% volume growth in the fourth quarter. This resulted in 6% growth in annual sales of $4,500,000,000. ", "As a quick review of a year that marked our 50th anniversary, we positioned ourselves for future growth and presented a number of strategic and operational goals, including a long-term goal of 5% to 6% organic growth in sales and a return to 15% operating margin by the 2012/2013 period. In driving to those goals, we focused our top 2010 goals on cash flow and improving return on assets, continuing to innovate and accelerate products to market, optimizing our process and operations to maximize profitability, accelerating our growth in India and China, developing our people and finally, expanding our sustainability initiatives. ", "I am pleased to report that we exceeded our targets in many of these areas and I'd like to touch upon a few highlights. In the area of innovation and commercialization, I'm pleased that we launched over 55 new solutions this year, which compares to about 25 new solutions in 2009. That represents new products or new solutions represent approximately 20% of the sales in 2010. ", "We expanded our new CT series shrink film, further commercializing our newly patented manufacturing process which we are diligently working on to scale in other product families and to further drive differentiation and efficiencies across our core portfolio. ", "We are actively engaged in pilot testing our new patented Cryovac 360 shrink sleeve solution, which represents our initial entry into a new market segment for Sealed Air. We've expanded our portfolio of products using alternate raw material components, including our new Instapak RC45 foam-in-place system, which uses up to 25% organic content. ", "And in December, we acquired a 100% natural biodegradable plant-based buoyed film material, which we just launched under the brand name Pak Nature [ph]. We continue to expand equipment solutions in each business segment and benefited from ongoing customer investment. Company-wide equipment sales grew 17% in 2010, which suggests strong ongoing orders in 2011 and a strong order base. ", "We increased our service-on-service-based solutions. This includes the introduction of our PakFormance remote repair diagnostic service that supports our equipment systems, and we further expanded our I-Pack and Ultipack automation services for high volume fulfillment customers, a growing segment for our Protective Packaging business. ", "Looking at the developing regions on our focus on accelerating growth in China and India, we dedicated a key executive to spearhead this regional growth in 2010. Although we are in the early stages of implementing our new strategic plans in these countries, we generated approximately 30% sales growth in the businesses that are included in this program. ", "Looking at developing regions overall, we reported a sales growth of 10%, which includes 6% favorable foreign exchange. We saw several areas of strength in the fourth quarter, including a 23% sales increase in Brazil, which includes 15% favorable foreign change. China was also solid with approximately 9% sales increase as was Southeast Asia, which achieved a 16% sales growth, which included an 8% favorable foreign exchange. ", "By business, Protective Packaging led the developing regions of the world with a solid 21% growth rate, which includes 7% favorable foreign exchange. For full year 2010, developing regions represented 16% of total consolidated net sales. Key contributors to steady profitability performance were productivity gains achieved by our supply chain organization. These include $10 million of incremental benefits generated from our GMS program and approximately $90 million of benefits from our record-level performance in quality, safety and material yield, as well as ongoing improvements in labor and asset productivity. These productivity gains helped to largely offset the approximately $130 million in incremental raw material costs that we incurred this year. As we saw our average cost per pound of raw materials at a level almost on a par with resin costs in 2008. ", "Before I move on to key segment highlights, we launched an important global, company-wide initiative, branded SmartLife, which characterizes the holistic approach to our sustainability strategy. SmartLife embodies our guiding principles and practices in the area of workplace and supplier diversity, governance, workplace health and safety and our philosophy of how we design our products and services to minimize their carbon footprint throughout their entire lifecycle, from our in-house manufacturing process through to the waste stream, all in an effort to conserve resources and maximize material efficiency and use. And I'm pleased as we continue to develop initiatives on our SmartLife program. We will roll this out in 2011 and discuss them with you as they come to the market. ", "To spend a moment on our business segment highlights. Their key achievement was solid top line performance, which culminated in the strong fourth quarter for all businesses and all regions. The key drivers to this fourth quarter volume growth were: first, in our Food Packaging business, where 6% volume growth reflected both seasonality as well as incremental sales from new customers and new contracts gained across several regions, including an expanded presence in Asia, Central Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Volumes also benefited from strong U.S.-based fresh red meat exports and solid demand for equipment systems globally, which increased 30% in the quarter. ", "We did experience some weakness in Australia, as appreciating foreign currency rates hindered that region\u2019s export market and unfavorable weather slowed customer production rates. Unfortunately, recent flooding in Queensland appears to have impacted customer production sites, and we are currently assessing what effect this may have on our Australian volumes in early 2011. ", "The Protective Packaging business had a very strong quarter, with 8% volume growth that was generated largely in North America and Europe, due to the strength of industrial production and from e-commerce and fulfillment-oriented applications in those regions. The high-growth rate reflected not only ongoing recovery of unit volumes but also the strong reception of our new products among new and existing customers, which exceeded goals in several regions. We achieved strong unit volume growth in products such as our Instapak foam-in-place system, our air cellular products and our inflatable products, including our next generation inflatable bubble, or I.B. Express system.", "Our Food Solutions business achieved 6% volume growth in the quarter, which was largely due to an 11% volume growth in Europe. This strong growth reflected not only stabilizing economic conditions in that region but also ongoing growth in our Ready Meal solutions and strength in our newer case ready solutions such as Darfresh and Mirabella, due to their successful rollout programs, which continued throughout the year. ", "The business also achieved good performance in rigid containers used in deli salad applications. Asia was also an area of strength due to over 20% volume growth, primarily from our Ready Meals and Vertical Pouch Packaging solutions. ", "Our other category achieved 8% volume growth in the quarter, due largely to a 16% volume increase in Europe, where both our Medical and Specialty Materials businesses generated equivalent growth in the fourth quarter. ", "I would like to elaborate on our reported price mix results for the quarter. Our businesses have been generating benefits from their various pricing actions, and we did realize favorable contract adjustments on our business throughout the fourth quarter. However, the combination of selective pricing reductions associated with higher volume commitments from customers, which include items such as volume rebates, combined with transitioning sales to lower gauge products, has had an unfavorable impact on our reported price-mix results. Additionally, as mentioned in our press release, in some of our international businesses, we adjust pricing to maintain margin performance against fluctuating foreign currencies. As price-mix performance remains a key metric for our management team, we're carefully balancing our efforts to accelerate volume growth with the need to recover higher input cost through a combination of price increases, input substitutions and productivity gains. ", "Today, most of our businesses have already implemented price increases that either went into effect January 1 or will go into effect in February. And we're also continuing our productivity improvement initiatives where we have already demonstrated measurable results. ", "Now at this time, I will turn the call over to Dave Kelsey, our CFO, to discuss fourth quarter financial results in more detail", "David Kelsey", "Thank you, Bill. Like to provide some details on our operating expenses first then some other matters and finally, our key balance sheet and liquidity items. Then I'll turn the call back to Bill to discuss our guidance for 2011. ", "Looking first at our P&L statement for the fourth quarter, you'll note that marketing, administrative and development expenses decreased $14 million to $198 million or 15.7% of net sales. This decrease was primarily due to lower variable incentive compensation expenses as we only partially achieved our full year 2010 performance targets. Also, as you saw in our press release, we recognized $10 million of restructuring and other charges, of which $7 million related to the closure of a small factory in Europe and $3 million related to our Global Manufacturing Strategy program. ", "After several years of investment, realignment and start-up activities, I'm pleased to announce that this marks the completion of our GMS program. The listeners who are less familiar with GMS over the last five years, we have invested approximately $155 million in plant and equipment and incurred approximately $80 million of related expense. With this completion of the program, we have repositioned our supply chain platform for more profitable growth in developing regions while concurrently realigning our core manufacturing sites to improve operating efficiency. ", "Collectively, the individual projects making up GMS delivered cumulative annual benefits of $55 million in 2010. These benefits are expected to carry forward to future years, while the individual projects provide the foundation on which to generate additional benefits. ", "Moving on to other matters. In the fourth quarter, we sold all of our remaining auction rate securities investments and recognized a $6 million gain. ", "Now I'd like to turn your attention to some key balance sheet and liquidity items. Cash and cash equivalents were $676 million at December 31, 2010, down $19 million from December 31, 2009. We're very pleased with this achievement as we used over $370 million of available cash during the year for the redemption of 1/2 of our 12% senior notes, capital expenditures, dividends and $10 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. ", "Our receivables increased $30 million from December 31, 2009, in line with our increased sales volumes. Based on an analysis of our days sales outstanding, or DSO, and our past due aging balances, the quality of our receivables remains good and continues to improve. ", "Inventory investments increased $27 million from December 31, 2009. Excluding the increase attributable to foreign currency translation of $10 million, our inventories increased $17 million, growing less rapidly than revenue, resulting in lower days on hand, or DOH, invested in inventory. ", "Looking at our liquidity position. Our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents at December 31 was $754 million, down $72 million from September 30, 2010, reflecting our strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Also, we had no amounts outstanding under any of our committed credit facilities at any time during the fourth quarter. Our available committed borrowing capacity was approximately $750 million at December 31. ", "In summary, we remain well positioned to fund day-to-day operations and the pending W.R. Grace settlement, although we have no date certain on when we will contribute our funds. ", "And now, I'd like to turn the call back to Bill to discuss our 2011 guidance", "William Hickey", "Thank you, Dave. As you saw by our press release earlier today, we are expecting to maintain the volume momentum we generated in the second half of 2010 into 2011. This is reflected in our 2011 constant dollar sales growth rate guidance of 5% to 7% versus the prior year. It looks like January is already off to a good start as our volumes seem to continue strong into 2011. ", "This higher sales volume, combined with a leaner cost structure, ongoing productivity improvements and steady control of expenses, are guiding a full year 2011 EPS range of $1.75 to $1.90. As part of our guidance, we are assuming an annual low to mid single-digit increases in resin prices, which we expect to be higher on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter and then moderate in the second and third quarter before potentially rising again towards the end of the year. We're continuing to carefully manage the cost price spread as we pursue our growth targets. ", "Now let's look at our expectations for future organic growth. Over the last 12 to 18 months, our businesses had been developing growth strategies that are centered on innovation and geographic expansion. All of these plans leverage four growth drivers, which include newly patented technical platforms, our entry into new markets, expansion into unpenetrated applications and in service-based solutions and accelerating our growth in developing regions, we have been placing an emphasis on growth in China and India based on their long-term growth opportunities. We believe we will generate an average annual organic sales growth rate of 5% to 6% through 2013 through the successful execution of our strategic plans, combined with the benefits we expect to realize from an ongoing economic recovery. ", "We expect that we will generate approximately $750 million in higher revenue through 2013 that will likely be represented by a mix of 1/3 of which will come from our expanding our presence in core markets. Examples include growing our existing Mirabella and Darfresh solutions within the U.S. among nonusers and low-penetration users or expanding our equipment on automation sales within our current customer base. ", "We're expecting the remaining 2/3 of growth to come from a combination of new product sales and our entries into new applications and new end markets. Examples of new product sales will be new shelf-stable solutions, including aseptic formats, new automated fulfillment packaging systems, expanded applications using our new ETHAFOAM high-recycled content foam family. ", "New market entry goals, include establishing a sustainable presence in the $1 billion shrink sleeve market with our new Cryovac 360 sleeve and other areas of development include bag-in-box applications and an expanded presence in air applications. As you can see, our growth approach is diversified, which minimizes risk and increases growth opportunities for all of our businesses to leverage. ", "In addition to these organic growth rates, we will prudently evaluate M&A opportunities as additional sources of growth. But by their nature, acquisitions are opportunistic, so we would discuss any particular activity at the appropriate time. ", "To support our higher growth, we have raised our capital expenditure guidance to $150 million to $175 million in 2011, approximately $100 million of this capital is targeted toward growth and cost reduction initiatives globally, the remaining amount to be directed towards maintenance CapEx projects. Key growth projects include investing in developing regions such as equipping our new facility in Brazil, which will service Food Packaging customers and in our new technology platforms. These investments should bring our capital expenditure spending more in line with our depreciation and amortization levels of about $150 million per year, and we expect to maintain these levels over the next several years to support higher levels of unit volume growth, using new technology platforms and in non-core applications. ", "A key component of our long-term goal is return to a 15% operating margin by 2012 and 2013. A good example of our progress toward that way is, if you notice in the fourth quarter, that our Food Packaging business on a segment basis actually achieved an operating profit of 14.7% in the fourth quarter. Another key enabler towards reaching this goal is the operating leverage that is generated by the higher unit volume growth rates, which I've previously mentioned. ", "To achieve our profitability goals, we have ongoing projects that target incremental productivity improvement across our platforms and are aggressively deploying cost-to-serve initiatives that focus on product and customer profitability and process simplification. We continue to maintain diligent management of expenses and are redeploying key resources into growth initiatives. As such, we feel confident in our ability to continue to generate solid incremental margins as we realize our growth volumes. ", "We have noted additional assumptions for our 2011 guidance, which you can find in our press release. But I'd like to note that our 2011 EPS guidance continues to exclude the payment of the W.R. Grace settlement and the impact of that going forward as the exact timing of the settlement is unknown. ", "We estimate that the payment of the settlement is expected to be accretive to EPS by approximately $0.12 to $0.14 annually, following the payment date on the assumption of using a substantial portion of our cash balance to fund the payment. ", "And now, operator, I'd like to open up the call to any questions from the participants, and we'll follow up with text questions from our webcast participants as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.", "George Staphos", "First question for you, Bill. You mentioned that there were various factors including mix, I guess, that made for a -- this is my wording not yours, but somewhat compressed price-mix result for the quarter. Is there a way to disaggregate as much as possible across your various products what are average price change was and what the effect of mix was to lessen that? It just seems like it's a very low number relative to what these reported sources were saying about resin cost increase in the fourth quarter.", "William Hickey", "Yes. You\u2019re right, George, we spent a fair number of hours trying to disaggregate it and the complexity continues to overwhelm us. Dave Kelsey and I have spent a lot of time on it and we will spend more time on it over the next couple of days to see if there is a way we could disaggregate it. I'll give you an example, when we introduce the CT-301 films, they use 30% less resin to make a shrink film. Now we do sell it at a lower price. We maintain our margin, we maintain our profitability but the fact is that it's replacing a film called D-955, which has a higher selling price. That's one fact, just the swap. And then as we\u2019ve gained new customers that aren't in our base customer base, that higher volume is a second mix as you roll that product family up. So it is rather complicated and you've got the currency factor. If you look back in the footnote to that page on price volume mix back attached to the press release, you'll see that approximately half of the $30-odd-million for the year and about the same for the quarter are really FX related. So it's a swamp that we need to drain a little bit better, George. I mean, I know where you're coming from. I do the same thing here every day. You can ask my colleagues next time you're out to see us about trying to get a handle on that. So the answer is there's a lot in that number, that price-mix number, and we will try to see if we can disaggregate it, George.", "George Staphos", "The related follow-on, two parts very quickly, the $30 million in FX, why wouldn't that be captured in FX opposed to in pricing? And again, if you just looked at like-for-like products where there was no substitution and maybe a flawed premise, you\u2019re continually trying to evolve your product line, but nonetheless, for products that you have like-to-like comparisons, what would that price change have been?", "William Hickey", "That's what we're trying to do. In terms of the FX piece, why it\u2019s not FX, it's actually an equal and offsetting amount in the FX column. And it relates to a historical practice on the food side of the business where we price to Latin American countries that were subject to volatile currency changes where we priced the product based in U.S. dollars. But the customers paid us in local currency so that the customer bore the exchange rate loss. Well what\u2019s happened in terms of number of countries in Latin America, the exchange rates change so they're actually paying at the same number of dollars but it's less local currency. So therefore, it comes across as a lower price. We will try to do it better, George.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "A couple comments in your press release related to volume rebates, which seem to be new items relative to before. Were customers trying to pre-buy during the fourth quarter to hit those rebates? And perhaps you can comment on whether it was a big pickup in December to support that or not.", "William Hickey", "No, it's interesting. I was watching that really closely, Ghansham, and that's why I was careful in my script to tell you that the volume commitment continued into January. So [indiscernible] first good start to the month of January. So there are always customers, Ghansham, that are on the edge that maybe will order a little more to hit the rebate level. But I think primarily, the point we're trying to make is some of that drops into the price effect. For example, at one customer, we picked up a fair amount of kind of new business. And in order to secure that new business, we essentially had to apply a rebate on that new business over their base business. So that's a factor where we try to say it in elegant way of there was some selective pricing actions in order to get the new commitments from customers.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Just as a follow-up, one of your competitors in Protective Packaging on their last conference call was talking about their price increase initiatives in North America and Europe being below target. They cited a lack of market support and just curious on whether this is consistent in what you're seeing.", "William Hickey", "Well, I haven't met a customer that likes a price increase, Ghansham, so I'll just leave it at that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just had a quick question on the pricing side. I mean, obviously, you guys have been a little more aggressive, but how much pricing do you guys expect for 2011 and when you guys expect to reach price cost parity?", "William Hickey", "Can you say the last part of that question again?", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Yes, I just want to get a better feel for how much, from a percentage standpoint, pricing for 2011 you're expecting to realize and when do you expect to meet price cost parity.", "William Hickey", "Dave, do you want to just take a stab on that? I mean, things move around a lot around here, so it's hard to say what's going to happen next month. But I'll let Dave try it.", "David Kelsey", "We don't typically give forward-looking guidance on pricing actions. I think Bill has summarized the comments in the press release relative to top line revenue growth of 5% to 7%. There is an element of price reflected in that and we continue to be focused on recovering our higher costs through a combination of price increases. Some of which we\u2019ve recently put in the market given today's resin environment.", "William Hickey", "Yes, I think as you heard me say probably during my comments, that we've got price increases January 1 in some of our business in February in other business, so we've got price increases on the Street now.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then on the CapEx increase for 2011, how much of that is secured by contracts or new business already? Or are you just filling capacity because you're anticipating faster growth?", "David Kelsey", "Well, as you can appreciate, you need to add the capacity before you can record the sales. We don't have long-term take-or-pay commitments for our products. But as we look out at that 5% to 7% sales growth in 2011, and previously, we've shared expectations that we think we can maintain that level of organic growth in the future periods, we clearly will need to add incremental capacity. Also, as some of the new platforms that we're developing are commercialized, we'll need to add new capacity. But there does need to be a triggering event where we can forecast out over the next two years sufficient broad-based customer demand to warrant putting those units of production into place. And I will point out that unlike very capital intensive industries, we can put some quality unit of production in place for several million dollars if we need to start adding a greenfield facility such as the Brazilian plant that we invested in 2010, that could run to $20 billion to $30 billion. But we're not putting all that $150 million into just one or two plants and it will be done incrementally as demand builds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup.", "Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc", "First question was on your segment margin progression as you look into 2011, you had mentioned, Bill, that the Food Packaging was inching up to that 15% target that you've given for the company but obviously, Protective. And I know there\u2019s some seasonality here but Protective had led down in the quarter. As you look into 2011, where do you think the biggest upside and conversely where do you think you have the most challenges in terms of margins by segment?", "William Hickey", "I'll tell you the one that actually did a little better than my original expectation was Food Solutions coming at 11. I was looking at more hit the 10 numbers. So they did a great job in Food Solutions in moving their margin up to 11. Protective usually ought to run in the 12 to 13 so I would expect perhaps if I look for the biggest improvement in \u201811, it would probably be in the protective side. And of course, the key thing when you really look at where we are is really to turn the other category around. Because if you take out the other category, I think our operating margin numbers will look quite a bit better.", "Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc", "And then separately, when you went through the top of your remarks in terms of the developing regions, I think you had mentioned a 10% sales growth but 6% of that was from FX. Is that one, did I hear that correct? And two, what do you think about the longer term? Obviously, you're talking here of extending presence in those markets. Was there something unique or kind of special that you\u2019d call out in terms of the growth in 2010? Because I would've thought that would've been on an organic basis higher than, call it, 4% or 5%.", "William Hickey", "Well, actually it was. If you look at our expanded sort of Emerging Markets business, we include the usual China, Brazil, India, but we also had, if you take out our Medical business which really had a slow 2010, it was up much more like 13%. So that sounds about right. If you take China alone, I think, you heard we said it was up about 30%, again, excluding the Medical business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls & Snyder.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Bill and Dave actually, you are looking at constant sales to grow at 5% to 7% in 2011, and that will include pricing, as Dave mentioned. Unit alone, what 6.7% in 2010, so you are really not expecting that much from volume growth. What am I missing?", "William Hickey", "Dave, do you want to...", "David Kelsey", "I'm not sure, completely.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Well, if you have 5% to 10% in sales and that includes some pricing which maybe 1% to 2%, then volume will be a heck of a lot lower than your unit growth of 6.7% in the fourth quarter of this year.", "David Kelsey", "Well, for this year, we got 5% volume growth and 5.9% all in top line growth. So we're really talking about top line growth that is in that same range that we had this year. We are looking forward to getting more pricing in 2011 than 2010 given the timing of how some of our price increases have come in the fourth quarter. We're expecting less wind at our back from foreign exchange, we got a favorable impact from foreign exchange in 2010. We're expecting a slightly negative impact in 2011. So the volume growth is not out of line with the volume growth that we achieved in 2010 as we look at our projected numbers in 2011, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "That is helpful but if I may push that a little bit, you have added manufacturing facilities, you have added lines. The global economy is recovering and that includes the U.S. and Europe which are mature area. Shouldn't your unit growth grow a lot more than what you are anticipating?", "David Kelsey", "Well, it did grow more in the Protective business. Our Protective business unit volume was up 9% for 2010, and it's still not back at the levels it was at prior to the recession. So we do see some opportunity in the Protective business to return to those pre-recession levels and contribute in 2011 to that top line growth. Then we go beyond 2011, that's when we expect to see some of these new platforms and some of these new technologies that Bill has referenced in his remarks continue to drive organic growth after the economy is back to pre-recession levels.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "This was all applied to Protective or does that apply to the company-wide businesses?", "David Kelsey", "The Protective side is primarily geared towards a broad-based cross-section of industrial and retail customers. So that is seeing much more of a rebound coming out of recession than the Food business has.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "The first question I had is actually a follow on to the last caller's question. When you look at that Protective business, you had some really good volume numbers, both in the quarter and for the full year. But when we look to contribution from those, it appears as though, if we just looked at 4Q, the margin was essentially flat on some pretty nice up volume. Is there something missing within there? Could you maybe expand on that a little bit as to where that contribution or something we're missing?", "David Kelsey", "Well, one thing to keep in mind, Chris, is that we had the restructuring charge in the fourth quarter for the closure of the European plant. So you want to make sure you're looking at the adjusted margin numbers for the quarter. I think that was roughly a $7 million add back.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Yes. So that would make it, I think, 13% in 4Q versus 12.9% last year. So just a little bit better but you had, I think, 9% to 8% volume growth?", "David Kelsey", "Yes, we had, I think, as I mentioned earlier for the year, volume grew 9%.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Right. So my question is, shouldn\u2019t we expect -- basically, it didn't translate into much improved margin from the higher volume. But what would the normal contribution margin look like in that business? Maybe I should ask that question.", "David Kelsey", "A normal operating margin which is really the number we look at, I think, Bill mentioned earlier that we would expect something in the 13% -- 12%, 13% range. So I think -- I'm not sure that I'm fully picking up on your issue. Clearly, the Protective business does have a higher resin content as a percent of its revenue than in our Food businesses, which use more specialty resins and also have more intellectual property built into their product mix. So the resin cost recovery is certainly one element that affected the Protective business throughout the year. But overall, I think the yield we've gotten from the increased volume in Protective was generally consistent with our expectations.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "And then the second question I had centered around the GMS program. So you're basically done with that. You said you had $55 million as a run rate, I think, in the press release coming out of the year. What's the incremental benefit to be harvested in 2011 beyond what you harvested in 2010? Or what's the extra yet to come?", "David Kelsey", "The last increment of benefit arrived in 2010, it was roughly $10 million. So on a going forward basis, we don't expect any incremental return from that initial capital and related expenditures. But as I mentioned, it does create a very efficient and effective global network of plants so that when we do things like add the incremental capacity we've been talking about with our capital spending, we can do so on a much more productive basis than we could've done five or 10 years ago. So those are the kinds of benefits we'll see on a going forward basis from having spent five years sweating the details on our Global Manufacturing Strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I noticed the $100 million in productivity you cited for 2010 and I just wanted to -- a couple of questions, wanted to confirm that, that does or does not confirm or include that is the $55 million from the GMS program. And can you give us an idea of what you see both of those possibly contributing in both '11 and '12, both productivity and GMS?", "David Kelsey", "The GMS one is fairly straightforward. As I just mentioned to the prior caller, $10 million of incremental benefit is attributable to the GMS program in 2010. So $10 million of the $100 million would be GMS related. Beyond that, there's a whole wide range of activities that have contributed to that productivity gain. Just like we talked about our resin purchasing and the activities there to improve yields, resin only represents roughly half of our purchases of goods and materials that go into cost of goods sold from third parties, and we have ongoing efforts in purchasing those consumables more effectively. We have several hundred factory floor projects that our supply chain teams initiate every year that contribute to that remaining $90 million of productivity gains. So there are a number of things in there that help drive that savings. On a going forward basis, we don't expect to add anything incremental specifically related to GMS. But as I said to the prior caller, it does give us a platform for future productivity gains. Our guidance does not contain a specific number. But as you take that guidance and work with your models, I'm sure you'll see where improved margins do factor into the earnings guidance range that we've given for the year.", "Chip Dillon - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And just as a quick follow-up, let's say you even take the high end of that range, at least I'm having a hard time getting north of certainly not even to 13% on the segments themselves. That lines up to the 12.1% you did in 2010. That would infer that you have quite a jump in '12 and/or '13 to get to the 15% goal. Are there things -- first of all, does my logic follow the way you guys are planning to get there? And secondly, are there things you can tell us we can look forward to whether it's the higher exposure to emerging markets or new products or more productivity that could get you to jump from, say, below 13% this year to say as high as 15% by two years from now?", "David Kelsey", "I think all of those are going to be contributors and the on adjusted operating income percent in 2010 was 12.2%. Clearly, to get to the 15% target that we've been talking about for a while now, we need to add 100-plus basis points to operating income in each of the next couple years, and that's part of the plan that we're working on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili of Macquarie.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Wanted to circle back a little bit on price cost. And if I look at the gross profit number for the fourth quarter, it looks to be relatively flat versus last year. If I look at EBIT, it looks to be relatively flat if I adjust for some of the things going on with incentive comp and SG&A. I know there's various factors you've talked about, but is there a way to help us with how much of that is temporary resin headwind that you think you're going to get back over the coming quarters?", "William Hickey", "I would say the majority of it\u2019s headwind between price cost. I mean, we implemented -- we basically implement prices now pretty close to when higher costs go up but you've always got customer orders in the pipeline, you got inventory turnover, so there's a catch-up effect and I would say that's the principal factor.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "And is there a way to help us quantify how much is you see as a temporary headwind there that you're going to catch up on given some of the other factors on discounts and...", "William Hickey", "I think we said the fourth quarter was about $25 million. In the fourth quarter was the resin costs \u2013 yes, about $25 million, $30 million fourth quarter that, obviously, the December 1 price increase picked up part of it, didn\u2019t pick all of it up. You\u2019ve got January price increase, you got some February price increases. So I mean, this is a process. As I've said on these calls for lots of years now, if resin would stay stable, you'd see things a lot more clearly but the volatility both up and down, both up and down, introduce kind of noise into the system. And I do appreciate you folks have a harder time following. But you can be sure, we're following it.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Follow-up question is on margins of some of the newer businesses that you're looking at, like expansion in the aseptic and some of the new initiatives there that you expect that will do 2/3 of your kind of growth over the next few years. Help us with the margin profile of these new expansions, how that compares to the existing business,", "William Hickey", "Let me just say quickly, by and large, most are higher, some are a little bit lower but they complement what we do. But right now, the improvement over that other category would be a big help because if you just take that low single-digit gain or loss on the other businesses to some reasonable positive number, you'll see it'll move the total quite a bit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Skidmore of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "This is actually Alex Ovshey on behalf of Rick. First, on the guidance as I look at the outlook, 4% or 5% to 7% volume growth or total growth in constant dollars sales, what does that imply for the actual dollar amount? What would the contribution to the EBIT line on a dollar basis be from the 5% to 7% uptick in sales? Can you share that number with us?", "William Hickey", "I mean, I would just do the math, I'll tell you really, but go ahead, Dave.", "David Kelsey", "I'll say the same thing, Bill. We don't give that kind of granularity guidance down to EBIT dollars or EBIT margins. We're going to have to leave that to your judgment to complete that part of the exercise.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I guess what I'm really trying to get to is how do we think about the incremental margin on organic volume growth in the business?", "William Hickey", "I would say the incremental margin's higher than the existing margin, existing company. The incremental basically is additive. So the last caller that should that should -- the incrementally should be accretive to operating margins.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just a question on free cash flow, can you talk about the priorities of free cash flow in 2011 and whether or not the settlement of W.R. Grace, if that would have an impact on the way you think about the use of cash flow in 2011?", "David Kelsey", "Well, not a lot that's changed on our thinking about free cash flow. Top of the list is reinvesting in the business and clearly, to support the organic growth opportunities we see ahead of us. We do anticipate bringing capital spending up to the extent that we think we have commercially viable projects to launch. On the balance sheet management side, other than the potential settlement on Grace, we have no debt maturities in the near future so that's not going to be a cash requirement. We did buy back a modest number of shares in the fourth quarter and continue to pay dividend in excess of $80 million a year, so returning capital to shareholders will continue to be a key element of our use of cash in 2011. And as Bill mentioned, on the acquisitions side, we are opportunistic. We are also patient and we'll advise you of anything that we think would make a value-adding acquisition when the time is appropriate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier of Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "I was curious if you're seeing a meaningful mix shift to products with lower price points, say, per unit area but yet higher contribution margins? I'm really thinking about, for example, some of your thinner shrink films?", "William Hickey", "Yes, I think you hit a good point there, Peter. It's all in this price-mix conundrum that we talked about earlier. We are seeing growth in the CT series film. We've introduced now three films from the original CT-301. Those are going well. Our Shrink business continues -- actually has had a good first year with these new products and they are lower selling price, there's less resin and we make good margins. So I think you're right on.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "And what percent -- if you could quantify, I would imagine it's a relatively small percentage today, but what percent of total sales might be these new products, the shrink film thinner products? And importantly, where could that go three to five years from now? Is it a meaningful step change or is it really more incremental around the edges?", "William Hickey", "Well, I'd hesitate to put a number on it because we're testing the technology across a variety of products. We saw it commercially shown it works on a standard shrink film, we are still doing experimental work on some of the other structures, other films we have. So I'd rather not sort of put a number out there that is really inappropriate at the current time. But if you asked the question of next quarter for the quarter after, we'll be able to keep you updated because I think it's a real great breakthrough in technology but it\u2019s yet to be proved in commercial.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Can I just ask a clarification question of David? On the D&A guidance of $145 million, I guess it was $176 million in '09, $155 million in '10. Can you just elaborate on that guidance and the related interest expense guidance at $150 million that's, I believe, without the Grace settlement?", "David Kelsey", "The interest expense is without the Grace settlement but does include the impact of having retired half of the 12% notes in the fourth quarter. As far as the D&A number, there are two pieces that go into D&A, one is the traditional depreciation and amortization of our capital equipment that we also have about $30 million in that number that represents the amortization of our share-based compensation. So the $145 million number is the plant equipment-related number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Magers of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Just a clarification and I apologize I know you guys have talked about pricing quite a bit, but you mentioned pricing initiatives being put through in January and February. Can you get a little bit more specific on that in what segments they were?", "William Hickey", "Sara, they were different prices in different segments. I think some of the food was January, protective, I think is February. They were all in the mid-single digit range, that\u2019s probably the best flavor I can give you. I mean, there are price increases out there so you can probably get a little more detail. It's not that it's not public. It's just I don't have all the details right here in front of me.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "To follow up on that, you made some good forward progress in Q3 on the price-mix side and kind of that came back a little bit in Q4. Was that all just higher volume on lower margin products, was that price? I'm just trying to think of how we're going to get back to, I guess, a more positive contribution from that price-mix component?", "William Hickey", "Well, I guess the simple answer is it takes a little time because, I mean, the raw materials have been moving rather dramatically up and down. If you remember, in 2009, they really went down. So that what happens is you've got some of those prices and contracts that still have a price from the prior quarter even though the raw material went up in the current quarter and those prices haven't been reset. So I mean the simplest thing that I can say is a little bit of time and hopefully, some stability until all catches up. Otherwise, we continue to kind of move the pricing along with the cost and we catch up. It just takes a little time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gilbert Alexandre of Darphil Associates.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "Does it make sense that your gross margins could approach 28.5% in this year or am I pushing it too much?", "William Hickey", "Gil, I would love to see it 30% but 28.5% would be good, too. Anything higher than today is what we're looking for.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "And my follow-on question is when you look at your Protective Packaging operating margins and you're looking at 15% operating rates for the company, is it pushing it too much for Protective Packaging operating margins to get to 14%? Or is that at the high side?", "William Hickey", "Gil, if you go back, I think, it's 2008, Protective was 16% operating margin. I think that's about the right number. We can check it to be sure, but I think it was 2008 was about 16%. And so it's not out of reach. It's not beyond what we've done. It's not that we're going to scale a mountain we haven't scaled before. We just have to stay ahead of this much more volatile price cost curve than I think most of us have seen in years.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up question from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.", "George Staphos", "Two questions for you, one, maybe you have mentioned it earlier, but if you could provide us some guidance in terms of what's impacting the tax rate into next year, what could cause the mix to change one way or another. And then I had a question I'll come back to once you answer the first one on capital intensity or the turnover on the capital spending, at least what\u2019s implied into your numbers.", "William Hickey", "I know our Vice President of Tax has done a lot of work here recently. Let me let Dave sort of try to fill you in on that.", "David Kelsey", "I think, George, the 27% tax rate is where we have started out the last couple of years in terms of guidance and then whether it's one-time events like the significant impact in the U.S. of retiring those 12% notes early or a failure of a government body to renew an expected tax benefit. Those have caused the actual rate to move around during the year. But as we move into 2011, based on our best knowledge of our mix of domestic and foreign income and the kind of tax regime that we have in place around the world, that's how we\u2019ve come back to that same 27% number.", "George Staphos", "And, Dave, just a quick follow on before I get to the other question, so in the fourth quarter what was driving that? Was that the early retirement of the notes?", "David Kelsey", "Yes, that's what took the rate in the quarter per se down into the low teens was the fact that we had a significant loss in the U.S. to record. And of course, the U.S. has the highest corporate income tax rate in the countries we do business in.", "George Staphos", "The other question I had, if I go back about a year ago, the company's view on capital spending was that, I think, you'd maintain a range of $80 million to $100 million or something in that range for the next several years based on the growth that you were seeing at the time, which as memory serves, you or putting roughly around 2% to 3%. 2010 came in at 5%. This year, you're now guiding to about 5% as well. And it seems like for that incremental, I think, it winds up being around $300 million of revenue between realized '10 and at this structure projected '11, you have to raise the capital spending $50 million to $75 million, which is not a bad turnover ratio. So are you getting 2x the revenue contribution for the investment that you're making on these new projects? And should we expect that going forward?", "William Hickey", "George, I really think it's more than 2x. I mean 2x is probably a floor. To tell you the truth, my goal is 2.5 to 3x. But the numbers kind of hang together. As Dave said earlier, we\u2019re only going to spend if we got the project to justify it.", "David Kelsey", "Yes, and what I'd also point out, George, is some of that $150 million or actually a large part of it is really not to drive the growth we're expecting in 2011. It's to give us the capacity for the 2012 and 2013 growth that we expect to see.", "George Staphos", "But again, the leverage you're getting on that is fairly significant based on that math.", "David Kelsey", "Yes.", "William Hickey", "I think the guys in the company know me well enough. If they bring a project, they got to have at least two-plus x.", "Operator", "You also have a follow-up question from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls & Snyder.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Could you give us a better feel for the investments you mentioned in the other category? And if in 2011, you see that particular area in the black, losses in the fourth quarter?", "William Hickey", "Yes, Rosemarie, there are several initiatives in that area. There are really four what we\u2019ll call strategic investments. One is an additional investment in our Medical business, which we hope that should be positive in this year. We also invested in this Pak Nature, which we'll be investing in. And I think that will not only be positive in '11 but very positive in '11, because I do believe it's a real revolutionary product. And there are two other technologies that we're investing in that have applicability across several businesses and we really believe that those could help multiple parts of the company. And when they are more mature and ready for prime time, we'll give you a little more information on them.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "Bill, if I may, if you eliminate those investments, could you share with us the profits from Specialty Materials and Medical applications, which I am guessing are the only two making money?", "William Hickey", "Yes, both Medical and Specialty are both making money, yes. They are making money. They make reasonably good money. They make comparable profit margins to the rest of the company. It's what I\u2019ll call, what we internally call, new ventures category, which are four technologies which we believe have a future in our space.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder LLC", "So when you say similar to the company, we are talking about around 12% if I looked at the segment's profit operating margin just for Medical and Specialty Material and eliminate the recent investments?", "William Hickey", "Yes. I think, yes. If you wanted to bifurcate it, you could say that you\u2019ve got 11, 12 or so in the Specialty Materials and Medical, and the balance in the new ventures which results in that minus couple of million dollars.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of KeyBanc Capital Markets with a follow-up.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Bill, I know you don't like to get too granular thinking of it quarter-by-quarter, but as we think of cost price working through 2011, with the couple of price increases you've got announced here for 1Q, realizing it takes time to work through, I guess, I would assume that you may be again a little bit behind in Qs one, probably catching up in Qs two and Q2. And then you said you think resins will start to move lower in Q2, three. So could you maybe talk through what your assumption was for full year 2011 for cost price? I'm assuming neutral or kind of how you would envision that playing out over the course of the year?", "William Hickey", "Yes, we stopped giving quarterly guidance a couple of years ago because of the extreme volatility of resin. I mean, it can go up one month and surprisingly come down the next month and I'm just not that good a forecaster. So what we try to do is manage the spread.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "So thinking about that spread with increases, I'm assuming that means 1Q, you'll again be a little bit behind, is that fair?", "William Hickey", "That's probably fair.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Second question I had as we think about some of the other -- your target for 15% margin, is that mostly predicated upon your other -- the Specialty business getting up to the rest of the company levels, or do you also assume that your Food businesses and your Protective business will be at or above 15% on their own?", "William Hickey", "I think all of the above. I mean, track food over a multiyear period. I think it's worth doing, tracking food. And I'll tell you, 14.7% in the fourth quarter\u2019s pretty good progress for that business, which is a very mature business. And as you begin to see opportunities to balance that price cost mix kind of service level ratio around the world. And those are the things that we're doing in every business as well as kind of the new technologies. ", "Okay. Operator, let's try to wrap up here. I'd like to thank you all for your participation. Extend my thanks and appreciation to our customers, employees, shareholders and partners and everyone who helped us celebrate our 50th anniversary and for your continued support as we look to 2011.

This call is being recorded.  Leading the call today, we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David H. Kelsey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions] And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future, are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-looking Statements in our earnings release, which apply to this call. Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors, and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial table that we have included in our earnings release.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William Hickey", "Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. During today's call, I would like to discuss our first quarter 2011 business performance, our revised guidance and then have Dave detail a few financial items. Once Dave and I have concluded our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take any questions.", "This morning, we reported our first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.34, which compares to reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $0.35 or $0.36 per share on an adjusted basis. Our earnings performance was primarily impacted by the timing of the recovery of higher raw material and transportation cost, which combined, were approximately $40 million higher than the prior period. We recovered about 50% of that higher cost with our $19 million increase in positive price mix. The balance had a net unfavorable impact on EPS of approximately $0.09 per share in the first quarter. In addition, there was an unfavorable $0.02 per share impact in Q1 from foreign exchange losses and gains. The rising commodity cost impacted profitability margin by approximately 90 basis points in the first quarter. While we are very disappointed to see any decline in margin, we are pleased by the relative resilience shown in our business as compared to the other peak resin periods, such as in early 2008 when margins declined in the range of 200 to 300 basis points.", "We attribute the improved performance in 2011 to the benefits of timely pricing actions, execution of those pricing actions, productivity initiatives, the completion of our global manufacturing strategy, ongoing tight control of expenses, steady headcount, and an increasing mix of new products and services in our portfolio. Overall, the fundamentals of our business remained solid in the first quarter. Our consolidated sales increased 6% to $1.1 billion. Our constant dollar sales, which exclude foreign currency translation, increased 5%, which is consistent with our guidance for the year. We maintained good volume momentum with a 3% volume increase in the quarter. Interestingly, by geography, the two more industrialized regions of the world, the United States and Europe, led the volume growth. The U.S. achieved a 4% volume increase and was followed closely by Europe with 6% higher volumes.  In Europe, I am pleased to report that all of our segments achieved volume growth in the quarter, aided by ongoing economic recovery, as well as solid demand for our solutions.", "Looking by business segment, Protective Packaging led volume growth with a 7% increase, again, driven by North America and Europe, which both grew at a comparable 7% rate due to ongoing strength in their industrial sectors. Secondarily, our Food Packaging business achieved 2% volume growth. Their volume growth was primarily driven by 6% higher volumes in the U.S., which was largely attributable to solid animal production rates which tracked higher by approximately 2% to 3% compared to last year, and by new customer relationships which were largely established in mid-2010.", "Before I move on to price mix, I would like to note that the pace of our volume growth was slightly muted by volume weakness in our Australian Food Packaging business due to flooding in that region earlier in the year. Also, we faced very challenging year-over-year comparison in our medical business in China due to pre-buying in the first quarter of 2010. Combined, these two factors equated to approximately 1 percentage point of unit volume growth. In both cases, we expect more normalized growth in the second quarter.", "Moving to price mix and productivity benefits, we achieved 2% favorable price mix or as I stated earlier, approximately $19 million. These benefits were led by approximately 5% higher price mix in our two Food businesses in North America. This solid increase was due to a combination of contract price adjustments and pricing actions in late 2010, among non-contract customers. Although most of our business segments announced new targeted price increases that went into effect in either January or February of this year, our quarterly results will not reflect meaningful benefits from these increases until the second quarter. This is due to a lag between pricing announcements, their implementation and impact on our earnings. Additionally, our businesses have already announced new targeted pricing actions that become effective in the April through June time period. These pricing actions are largely in North America and Europe and are predominantly in the mid to upper single-digit percent range. We expect to realize benefits from these actions starting in the third quarter from which we anticipate to yield price cost parity in that period.", "Productivity improvement continues to remain a focus as we manage our fixed overhead cost. In the quarter, we estimate that we achieved approximately $10 million of productivity improvements to our various supply chain initiatives and our cost-to-serve programs, as well as by holding headcount relatively flat. We expect to sustain this quarterly improvement rate for the balance of this year.", "Before I move to our guidance, I would like to touch upon our developing region sales, as it is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. In the quarter, we achieved a reported 6% sales increase in developing regions, representing 16% of consolidated sales. Excluding the Asia Medical business, which I referred to earlier, reported sales in our developing regions would have increased by 8%. Despite achieving double-digit sales growth across most of Eastern Europe and India, our developing region sales growth was tempered by a modest 3% sales increase in Brazil, due to a temporary weakness in the Brazilian beef industry.", "Looking at developing region growth by business segment, both Food Solutions and Protective Packaging reported double-digit sales growth in the developing regions with especially strong unit volume growth in Asia. Here, Food Solutions increased volumes by almost 40% and Protective Packaging increased volumes by 13%.", "Shifting to our EPS guidance. As you saw by our press release earlier today, we have now revised full year 2011 EPS guidance to $1.75 to $1.85 per share. This compares to our original full year EPS guidance of $1.75 to $1.90 per share. We made this change due to higher than expected petrochemical base cost, which we initially thought would peak in the first quarter of 2011. Based on the volatility in commodity prices, we are now assuming resin cost will peak in the second quarter which is likely to result in continued margin challenge in that quarter. We expect resin cost to decline very slightly thereafter and remain sequentially flat through the balance of the year. As such, we have updated our average annual resin price guidance assumption to reflect a year-over-year increase in the low teens percent range. Similar to what we experienced in 2008 and 2010. During those years, we incurred over $100 million of increased resin cost on an annual basis. This updated guidance compared to our original guidance of an average annual resin price increase in the low to mid single-digit percent range. As a standard practice, we continue to pursue cost recovery with our customers as we seek to offset commodity inflation. We do this not only through pricing actions, but also with productivity improvements, reformulations of our solutions, diversification of our material streams, a higher mix of new and differentiated solutions, and the use of freight or transportation surcharges as appropriate.", "We continue to expect a 5% to 7% increase in constant dollar sales growth in 2011. But as a result of our pricing action, we anticipate price mix will now represent a larger portion of the growth. Looking specifically at volumes, we expect full year consolidated volume growth to track reasonably well to our first quarter growth rates, with our Food Packaging business continuing to generate single-digit percent volume growth annually, with regional mix shifts occurring throughout the year due to variances in animal production rates. We expect our Food Solutions unit volumes to track similarly to Food Packaging as we pass the anniversary of the case-ready format change by a major retailer in August, and continue to expand our solutions globally in the second half of the year. We expect Protective Packaging unit volumes to grow at a slightly lower rate than demonstrated in the past few quarters, as year-over-year comparisons become more challenging in the second half of the year, as volumes return to pre-recession levels. And finally, we expect our other category annual volume to increase to high single-digit percent rates as we pass the anniversary of the 2010 pre-buying in our medical applications business and our Specialty Materials business continues to recover.", "As volume seasonality and price mix benefits tend to build towards the latter part of the year, as do benefits for productivity improvements and favorable foreign currency translation, we now expect to achieve higher earnings in the third and fourth quarters, which will enable us to deliver our full year EPS guidance. Lastly, as noted in our release, we have lowered our capital expenditure guidance by $25 million to reflect changing in the timing of projects. As such, we are now projecting capital expenditures to be $125 million to $150 million this year. We have maintained our original assumptions on other guidance items such as our effective income tax rate, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow of over $300 million. And to reiterate our press release, our earnings guidance excludes the payment of the W.R. Grace settlement as the timing of that settlement remains unknown. However, the proceedings still continue to ahead and are currently in the appeals process in the District Court of Delaware, with the next hearing date set for June 28.", "Before I pass the call to Dave, I would just like to reaffirm that the fundamentals of our business continue strong as we navigate through some regional market weakness and commodity cost inflation to which we are proving to be more resilient. We are actively managing through these factors, and I believe that we are performing above market rates due to the strength and diversity of our portfolio solutions, unique technologies, diversion to national footprint, and extensive and deep customer relationships. Today, we remain focused on executing our 2011 plans and achieving our EPS guidance. All of our people are doing an outstanding job in the face of challenging input cost and a still fragile economic recovery. I do want to commend our sales and our service people who have done an excellent job in managing price increases while still growing our business. And now I'm going to turn the call over to Dave Kelsey to review some additional details of our financial performance and our liquidity position. Dave?", "David Kelsey", "Thank you, Bill. I'd like to provide some details on our operating expenses, our other expense income line item, and our key balance sheet free cash flow and liquidity items; then I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "Looking first at our marketing administrative and development expenses for the first quarter, you will note that these expenses increased $11 million to $186 million, but remained flat as a percentage of net sales. Excluding $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, these operating expenses were higher by $9 million. This increase includes higher compensation expense of approximately $5 million, severance charges to better align our resources with our growth opportunities in our Food Solutions segment of $2 million and $2 million of SG&A related to three small acquisitions that had not yet closed in the first quarter of last year. Disciplined expense control while investing in our future is one of the cornerstones of our business strategy. ", "Moving down the P&L, our interest expense was $4 million less in the first quarter of 2011 compared to last year, due to the redemption of $150 million of our 12% senior notes in December of 2010. Other expense was $4 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with income of $2 million in 2010. In the first quarter of this year, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses on some of our non-U.S. dollar denominated intercompany receivable and payable balances due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar in the quarter. In 2010, we recognized net foreign exchange gains of $3 million, primarily resulting from the favorable impact of the remeasurement of one of our intercompany loans.", "Now I'd like to turn your attention to some key balance sheet, free cash flow and liquidity items. Cash and cash equivalents were $196 million at March 31, up $20 million from December 31 of last year reflecting our cash flow from operations. Approximately 45% of our cash is held in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and benefited from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies in the quarter. Our receivables decreased $1 million to $696 million on a reported basis during the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, our receivables would have declined $23 million on a constant dollar basis from December 31, 2010. This decline was primarily in our customer receivables balances in Europe, mainly due to normal seasonal patterns. The year-over-year increase in our receivables was consistent with our revenue growth and our days sales outstanding was essentially unchanged. Inventory investment, increased $63 million on a reported basis from December 31. Excluding the increase attributable to foreign currency translation of $15 million, our inventories increased $48 million. This increase is primarily due to the rise in raw material cost and the buildup of inventories in our North American and European Food businesses, in anticipation of normal seasonal sales increases in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, our days inventory on hand were essentially unchanged as compared to the same period last year.", "We realized $54 million of free cash flow in the first quarter. The $43 million decline in free cash flow, compared to the first quarter of last year, was primarily due to a climb in free cash flow generated from working capital items. The net unfavorable foreign exchange impact on our combined balance of receivables, inventory and payables was approximately $30 million. We still anticipate free cash flow to exceed $300 million in 2011 as net earnings expand in future quarters and process improvements and seasonal movements lead to reduced inventory by year end.", "Looking at our liquidity position, our debt, net of cash and cash equivalents at March 31 was $717 million, down $37 million from December 31, reflecting the positive cash flow from operations and the repayment of some short-term borrowings during the quarter. We have no debt maturing this year. In addition, we have no amounts outstanding under any of our committed credit facilities at any time during the first quarter. Our available committed borrowing capacity was approximately $768 million at March 31.", "In summary, we remain well positioned to fund day-to-day operations and the pending W. R. Grace settlement, although we have no date certain on when we can contribute our funds. Now, I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your question.", "William Hickey", "Thank you, Dave. Operator, I would now like to open the call up to any questions from the participants and we'll follow up with questions from our webcast participants as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George Staphos", "Thanks. First question I had, could you again, go through what price increases you have in the market currently? And what, if any, tactics you're taking to make sure that it's implemented as much as you would like it to, if not more relative to history? And then I had a follow-on.", "William Hickey", "Sure, George. I'll try to go quickly because I got list of them a page long. Food Packaging: January 11; Europe, January 11 -- April 11; Australia, New Zealand, Selective, 4%; Latin America, 15%; Argentina, 6% -- rest of Latin America; Food Solutions North America, March, Food Solutions, Europe, January 6 -- 6, 5 in March; Australia, New Zealand, Q2, 6; Latin America, Northern Cone [ph] 17%; Protective, February was 8%, April 4%.", "George Staphos", "Okay. I think you said mid- to high single digits and it was between April and June, and U.S. and Europe primarily?", "William Hickey", "Yes, right. I mean, seriously, George, maybe it's a good point to note this, is U.S. and Europe are where the resins had the most impact. A lot of the rest of the world, because of the strengthening in Brazil of the real and the strengthening of the Australian dollar, the impact on a local basis has really been pretty modest.", "George Staphos", "Okay. I guess, the follow-ons are, one, how do you implement it more effectively than in the past, perhaps, although you've been doing a good job more recently? And then, when you say parity on price cost, does that means it's a 0 by the third quarter? Or that you recovered the $20 million or so that you're behind in the first quarter by then?", "William Hickey", "No, 0 -- I mean, basically, we've upped the outlook with increases continuing to occur so third quarter is parity in the quarter. But let me give you an example, we do catch up. For example, resin went up $0.05 or so at the end of last year. We had price increases in December, okay? If you look at it, interestingly enough, the sequential increase in resin was about $15 million sequentially, from Q4 to Q1. If you take our price increases in Q1, which are about $19 million, and I don't have the breakout but I'm pretty confident most of that's from the fourth quarter price announcements. So first quarter would have caught up with the fourth quarter and would have been higher than parity in Q1 had resin not gone up in again in Q1. So that's just a little example of -- it does catch up, but Q3 is parity, Q4 start catch-up.", "George Staphos", "Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the Food Packaging business. I think you said volumes were up 2% year-over-year, North America up 4%, Europe up 5%. Does that mean, just based on your comments, Australia was down double digits, to sort of reconcile towards that two?", "William Hickey", "It means Australia and Brazil were both down; and Brazil were both down. And I think Brazil was actually down a double-digit number. I think Brazil was actually down -- and I'm trying to look at my notes, Ghansham, but Brazil was surprisingly down for a couple of reasons. In fact, the beef industry in Brazil has been hit by very high prices, the high exchange rate for the Brazilian real has really reduced the export market quite significantly. And we had one of our customers, Mataboi, who is a Brazilian exporter, actually go into I guess the Brazilian equivalent of bankruptcy. But actual slaughter in Brazil was down 15% in the first quarter.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Got you. And just in terms of the resin issue. The $0.09 impact in the first quarter, assuming parity by the third quarter, your pricing will clearly kick in for the second quarter, but resin\u2019s up quite a bit as well. Is the $0.09 impact sort of what you expect for the second quarter as well? Or is it going to bridge the parity between 1Q and 3Q? Thanks.", "William Hickey", "Well, yes. I mean, actually, I was going to ask you the question, Ghansham on your numbers for the resin. We're looking at resin going in April and May and kind of flatlining and roughly about the same increase in Q2 as Q1. I don't know, hopefully, that's consistent with where you think things are. But that's our best look right now and of course, I haven't found anyone that can really forecast resin well.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Me neither. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "All right, guys. Bill, I really appreciate the color you provided on the different price increases, but to just help me understand -- I mean, when you account for everything, your run rate for Q1 was about 1.8%, so what's the number for 2Q and 3Q? Just because it's on a blended basis and it's across the board, running across the board?", "William Hickey", "Yes, yes. By the way, Philip, before I answer your question, I do want to thank you for the charts you put in your March 31 report. Because I think those are very helpful for people to see that as resin goes up and down, we gradually work our way back and we get back to parity. It just depends on how quick it goes up and how quick it flattens out. So thank you for that very useful report. But we're looking at 3% for the year. We're looking at 3% price for the year. The $18 million -- as I say, most of the $19 million in the first quarter was a carryover from Q4 price increases.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then just switching gears a little bit. It sounds like the Grace situation is going to get pushed out a bit. Possibly 4Q, but that's anybody's guess at this point. Would you consider doing something more strategic with your free cash flow before Grace comes out of bankruptcy?", "William Hickey", "Well, let me say that I'm enthusiastically looking forward to Grace coming out of bankruptcy. Because it will give us a lot more flexibility in what we can do. But as of now, as you know, there have been 11 appeals filed. The current hearing is June 28. We really don't know what's going to be the outcome of that. So I guess, very honestly, Philip, we're just on standby right now.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. All right, guys, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "A couple of questions for you. First, could you maybe help us with -- from the sounds of things, you pushed out some of the assumption for the year, for some of the earnings. You talked about second half of the year, things getting appreciably better. And at the same time, you raised productivity and some of your of other initiatives as having a bigger impact. Can you talk about what new projects or what extra things you're working on that give you more confidence in achieving some improved outlook in the back half of the year from productivity and other projects like that?", "William Hickey", "Sure. Let me let Dave handle that.", "David Kelsey", "Yes, Chris. The productivity is really a continuation of our ongoing programs, mostly in the supply chain area. We did achieve roughly $10 million of year-over-year productivity improvements in the first quarter and we expect that rate to be maintained on a quarter-over-quarter basis for each additional quarter this year. So second quarter, we should see 10% productivity gains compared to the second quarter of last year; same thing in the third and fourth quarter. Then, I think, if you look at the productivity gains we've achieved in the last couple of years, a $40 million target for the year is very reasonable relative to our past success.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "How would that have differed from what you'd have thought back in January?", "David Kelsey", "These are programs that have been in place, such as our cost-to-serve program which is looking at customer profitability on a very granular basis. So there's no -- there's nothing that is getting rolled out in response to the resin environment, per se. These are the benefits we expect to see on a year-to-year basis from ongoing programs.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay that's helpful. And my follow-up is, as we look at the volume progression, it seems like you\u2019ve kind of brought down the assumption by a couple points for the full year. And if I recall, back on the January conference call, I think you got off to a -- you were off at a pretty good clip, mid- to upper-single digits at that point in time. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the progression through the quarter that you saw -- that things changed appreciably? And kind of what some of the pieces were that led you to kind of pull those numbers a little bit for the balance of the year?", "William Hickey", "Yes, yes. Look, I'll take it back, this is Bill. A couple of things. One, kind of -- February was really a very slow month, a very slow month across most of the world, whether it was a correction or the beginning of the surge in oil prices, but it put a temporary slowdown. And then the second thing is, we\u2019d then given sales organization pretty straightforward marching instructions in terms of price. And you know, with only 24 hours in a day and we can't get the same amount of growth going after new business when we really got to maintain and raise prices at our very large, existing customer base. So it's a resource allocation issue. We think the potential is there for the higher growth, but right now, the most positive impact we can have upon the company in this year is to have them focus a fair amount of their time on raising prices.", "Christopher Manuel - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "That's fair. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "When -- going back to the parity, Bill. Are you talking about -- or Dave, are you talking about catching up with the dollar amount? Or are you talking about catching up with the margin that you had last year?", "William Hickey", "Dave?", "David Kelsey", "Yes. We're talking about recovering the incremental year-over-year increase in resin cost, offsetting that dollar for dollar with higher selling prices in the third quarter.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay, which means that then the margin probably, on the higher revenues, right, is going to still be depressed versus last year in the third quarter.", "David Kelsey", "The way -- the margin percentage will be down a little bit just the way the arithmetic works, the same way that our margin percentage has gone down as we have introduced things like outsourced products into our mix over the last several years. But that's more the arithmetic on the margin percentage, and we're focused much more on the absolute dollars that are going to be coming in the door at the end of the day.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. No. I was -- this is what I thought but I wanted to confirm, that actually that was the case. And then, if I may, you talked about adjusting prices via renewals of contracts in the Food Packaging in North America. Could you talk to us about the contracts you have in other areas, other business areas as well as other regions? Do you have the same facility of raising prices on an as-needed basis?", "William Hickey", "Yes. I think Rosemary -- this is Bill back -- is that the contract practice is primarily a U.S. practice. The Europeans, it's a very, very small percentage of the European business, and as we've gone to some European customers and talked about it, they basically said no. So we see it in the U.S. We see it a little bit in Brazil with 1 or 2 of the very large processors and we see it in Australia with the large processors. But those are really the only places that we see the prevalence of contract buying. And again, it's primarily in the Food business.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And if I just can follow up on the Food Solutions severance, in order to adjust your capacity, vis-\u00e0-vis, the demand. Could you give us a little more color as to what you are actually doing and how much you have eliminated?", "William Hickey", "Well, actually -- interesting, Rosemary, that is really in the sales organization. What we have found, as we're trying to accelerate the growth of the Food Solutions business into these new areas such as aseptic packaging and ready meals, we're finding that we don't have the right skill sets among some of the organizations, some parts of the organization. So what we have done is we have begun a process of replacing those with people with industry knowledge and technical knowledge for those areas where the growth opportunities are in Food Solutions. So it's not a savings; it's basically we are replacing skills from what we had to versus what we need going forward.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. So that should really lead to a substantial growth going forward.", "William Hickey", "We hope so.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Magers from Wells Fargo.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Just a quick question on the guidance. You\u2019ve kind of given us what your ramp will be throughout the year on resin. Does the guidance include any kind of assumption regarding pricing initiatives in the second half of the year? Or does it, at this point, just take into consideration what you've done thus far and what you expect to achieve April through June?", "William Hickey", "Sara, it's really based on what we see through Q2. At this point, what we have posted covers the cost inputs that we've seen through the second quarter. So we are looking out at input cost through the second quarter and have announced pricing that at the end of the second quarter we'll get, as we said earlier, to parity in Q3. Obviously, if there are further changes on input cost, we will have further changes on price.", "Sara Magers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay, great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "A couple of questions. Bill, I wondered -- just as you think about the balance of the year, this FX that you talked about, particularly in regard to the Brazilian and Australian meat businesses, what do you assume that that's going to mean for volume for them for the balance of the year? And what does that mean for Sealed Air?", "William Hickey", "Well, the interesting thing about the global beef is we\u2019d probably get it no matter where it is. It just appears in different parts of the world.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "It\u2019s like whack-a-mole.", "William Hickey", "I don't want to use that analogy. But it's kind of like that. If it is not sold from Brazil, it's sold from the U.S. If it's not sold in the U.S., it's sold from Australia so it kind of moves around depending on price and currency. But we are anticipating somewhat of a recovery in Brazil later in the year. Australia, the herd size has gotten pretty small and so Australia's recovery is probably going to be much more modest, but production is going to be up like 2% versus down in the second half of the year. So, I mean, the U.S. still has a fair amount of capacity and the U.S. and Canada still have pretty sizable export potential and that serves us well.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "And just to kind of follow on that. I mean, we've got a lot of, as you're dealing with, a lot of commodity inflation all around the world already. And we're seeing a lot of food price inflation. And I just \u2013 do you have any thoughts on when that could start to impact red meat or just protein consumption generally as maybe people trade down away from protein?", "William Hickey", "We actually, you are seeing some of that now. Interesting, in Brazil where red meat cost have gone up quite a bit, we actually are seeing consumption change. I think the numbers that I saw in Brazil is, just so far this year on a quarterly annualized basis, chicken consumption has gone from 39 kilos per capita to 42 kilos per capita, something in that order of magnitude. So you're seeing more chicken being consumed. Particularly even in markets that are usually heavy beefeaters like the Latin Americans. So yes, you will see shifts in consumption. Obviously, we see it in a different part of our business, whether it's packaging chicken or pork or lamb. We kind of share the proteins across the company so we may see a change from one format to another. But invariably, we'll pick up the business somewhere in the circuit.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then finally, just that $40 million productivity number that you and Dave talked about. How do you think about your ability to retain productivity gains in your business because presumably, in most businesses, real costs go down over time? So part of productivity gains is just the price of staying in the game.", "David Kelsey", "I'm not sure I heard the question there.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Well, you've got to -- I mean, everybody takes out cost every year, just sort of part of being in business. I'm just wondering, if you do something like a $40 million kind of cost reduction productivity improvement, how much of that do you retain for shareholders versus how much gets bid back to the market?", "William Hickey", "I think the intent is, from there we are today, that we're retaining all of it.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay very good. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Macquarie.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Thanks. I guess, Bill, first question is on, what competitive -- how do you assess the competitive environment right now? And have you seen your competitors follow you on your price announcements that you indicated to an earlier question?", "William Hickey", "Yes. Let me sort of answer your first question. The competitive environment is always challenging. I mean, I do think in many of our markets, there's overcapacity in the industry. That generally carries over because volumes have still not returned to the peak 2008 levels, before the economy turned down. And I think a lot of that capacity was bought in anticipation of the continued spectacular increases people were seeing in that 2005 to 2008 period. So there's a lot of people looking to fill machine time. As far as price increases, I'd rather sort of not speculate on what the competitors are or are not doing. I think the best thing to do is to ask them.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then, I guess, what I was getting at is there anything that gets you confident that these pricing -- the price announcements that you have announced are going to stick, because it is pretty competitive out there, particularly in some of your end markets in Europe.", "William Hickey", "Yes. Well, one of the things that you may have heard us say on an earlier call, on a cost-to-serve, I think, a number of years ago, we improved the profitability of our European Protective business by 200 basis points essentially by firing a number of customers. I mean, that's what you have to do.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Thank you. And the follow up is on the other segment. Understanding the comp was certainly difficult on the Chinese Medical business, but if we look at the absolute operating profit this quarter, it was pretty small. Is there anything beside -- is it just a delay in resin that's causing that? Or is there more investment you are doing there? What's the outlook to get the margins back up in that other segment? Thank you.", "William Hickey", "Dave?", "David Kelsey", "Yes. I think there are two things, in addition to Medical, that are reflected in those margins. One is on the Specialty Materials business, there has been a little bit of a lag in recovering raw material prices. Some of their products have a fairly high raw material content relative to some of our other portfolio. So there's been some margin compression there. But the other big impact has been related to one of the new technologies that we acquired last year, that we've been developing. The spending to develop that technology was about $2 million of incremental SG&A in the first quarter, that we had no comparable spending on in the first quarter last year. So I think those two items combined with the Medical topic that we discussed earlier are behind the margin compression in the other category.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And that extra SG&A spending ramps down from here or is that sustained for a little while longer?", "William Hickey", "The SG&A will be sustained. Hopefully, there will be a revenue stream coming into offset it some time in the fourth quarter and then escalating next year. We have a new product that we're working diligently to get into the market.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thank you. A couple of questions. First one, can you just talk about what kind of inflation you're seeing for specialty resins relative to commodity resins?", "David Kelsey", "Much less, much less. I guess the only specialty resin, if you want to call it specialty, that seems to be climbing abnormally is nylon. Which has gone up and -- it's actually because one of the components of nylon is actually in demand by a number of places in the world. Interestingly enough, the rise in cotton prices -- I mean, if this is a balance that gets -- I get to learn more industries -- the rise in cotton prices to record levels has put more demand on nylon for some applications which is then putting demand on nylon we use in packaging. So with the exception of nylon and EVA, most of the other specialty resins are behaving fairly well.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's helpful. Then, I think you may have talked about this earlier on the call, but I didn't quite completely follow. If you think about the total revenue base of the company, what percentage of the revenue base allows you to pass through higher resin costs via contractual agreements with customers versus the revenue base where you have to go out there and get pricing in the markets through letter price hikes?", "William Hickey", "It's about 20%, about 20%.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So 20% is contractual passthrough and then the rest would be letter price hikes?", "William Hickey", "Right.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That was helpful. And then I -- just the last question. I think, in the middle of year to late last year, a competitor or not necessarily a competitor, but another big flexible packaging company wanted to get into the case-ready market. Can you just talk about the competitor landscape right now in case-ready?", "William Hickey", "I think I would just say that we have the most case-ready offerings, seven different formats for a variety of opportunities around the world. We sell all seven. At this point, there's really not much we've seen from other players in the market in a comparable case-ready format that's really achieved any significant play in the market. I think I'll just stop there.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. Thanks very much for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gil Alexandre from Darphil Associates.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "You talk of operating profit objectives of 15% in 2013. Could you give us some color, as far as Protective Packaging or the other areas, how far operating profit margins should recover? Can they get back to the 14% area? And how much does Grace contribute to this 15% operating profit margin? Or, you might like to give some color of what your operating profit objectives are in the other two key areas of your business.", "William Hickey", "Yes, yes. Let me just say -- Gil, let me start backwards. From Grace, there's no impact on operating profit, because with Grace, costs are below the line. So I mean that will add about $0.01 a month to EPS, like when it goes away. But it's all below the operating profit line. Now on Protective, actually if you look back, Protective was well over 14%. I'm just looking for that, Gil, quickly, that...", "David Kelsey", "It was close to that in '07.", "William Hickey", "Right, right. And if your remember '07 was, how can I say this? Was a relatively stable resin environment. And I think that this business catches up. So just give us a flat runway and we'll catch up to that number. Protective is very leveraged to increase sales and stability in resin price even if it's a high level. So that 14.7% in 2007 is well within reach.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "14.7%?", "William Hickey", "Right. Well within reach. I think Protective has got the capability to go well over 15%. Just because of the nature of the business. And some of the new things we're doing.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "Okay. And you want to comment on any profit goals for the other two key areas?", "William Hickey", "Yes. I think the others, I think we sort of said, it'll get to 15%. I mean, I think the core Food Packaging business has been close to 14% in the last three years. The Food Solutions business, I think we've always said that their target will be somewhat lower because they buy about $200 million worth of outsourced products on an annual basis. And since we just are a reseller of those products, our margins tend to be somewhat lower on a redistribution, so to speak, than a manufactured product. So Food Solutions is a business, it's probably going to run probably more low teens. But again, if you strip out the outsourced products, it should hit the 15% number.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "You're very kind. And my last, if I may just ask on this quarter. It's going to be pretty tough to match last year's pretax margins, isn't it?", "William Hickey", "Well, I never give up, Gil. You should know me well enough. I don't give up.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "Okay, thank you.", "William Hickey", "Stay tuned. We have an internet -- we have a web question which I'd like to take before we get to long. Let may read the question. It\u2019s a web questions came in. Says, \"In the case-ready format change with a major retailer -- is the case-ready format change due to a competitor\u2019s product introduction? Any additional color? Are they similar to the change that occurred with Wal-Mart in 2008?\" The answer, shortly is it's not a competitor\u2019s product introduction. It is very similar to the Wal-Mart 2008, and actually, it's a follow-on from that. Particular retailer changed what are known as the muscle cuts of meat from case-ready to a tray overwrap in a mother bag and kept their ground beef in the case-ready form. They have since decided to change their ground beef to the overwrap which the [Technical Difficulty] to tray overwrap in a mother bag. We did pick up some of that tray volume in our Food Packaging business, which basically sells trays. But the case-ready component left the Food Solutions business. And the annual number is about $25 million and it was lapped, probably, in August of this year. So hopefully, that gives you a little color to that question. Okay, Operator, we can take one more over the phone here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Peterson [ph] from Morgan Stanley.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I was hoping you could give us your updated thoughts around the credit rating. Specifically, is getting the lift to investment grade from S&P something that you guys are focused on?", "William Hickey", "We are certainly focused on it. I don't know that it penalizes us, because I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do not have any debt maturing this year, which means we would not expect to be going to the capital markets to raise new debt. The latest publications coming out of S&P, I think have been upbeat in their prospects for both the packaging sector and for Sealed Air in particular for an upgrade. But if I had to sort of put a stake in the ground, I imagine it will take a triggering event, such as the Grace settlement, before we actually see the upgrade in our rating from S&P.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "But if -- I mean, if you went to them and just kind of demonstrated that, hey, this is something that we're focused on long term, and as we try to grow our business and reward shareholders, this is going to be a constraint that we're going to keep in mind. I mean is that something that you\u2019d be willing to convey to them?", "William Hickey", "We will repeat -- or let's take that up after our second quarter call. We have annual meetings with both agencies and they coincidentally are coming up in the next 6 weeks.", "William Hickey", "We've got three in the queue. So we'll take those three and then we will wrap up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier from Barclays Capital.", "Peter Ruschmeier - Barclays Capital", "Just two quick ones, if I could. I'm sorry if I missed this, but could you talk more about your dialing back your CapEx? I know it's a bit of a timing issue. But can you elaborate on the dialing back of your CapEx guidance? And then you're still targeting $300 million or so of free cash flow. Can you really amplify how you think about the priorities for that free cash flow in the context of not having big capital projects that you're going after?", "William Hickey", "I'll just very quickly say that the timing of the capital is primarily influenced by the fact that our kind of volume growth is a little less than we originally were looking for, for 2011. As I mentioned earlier, that we're really spending a lot of time in the first half of the year putting in place price increases to cover the input cost. So we still have ample capacity on our current install base with the unit volume growth we're seeing. So these will get pushed out, maybe the second half of year, but if we do that, that really won't hit the books until the first part of 2012. On your second question, with capital down, we will consider other ways to use our cash flow. As Dave said, we have no debt maturing this year. Obviously, we want to continue to invest in the business. And if an attractive acquisition opportunity comes along, clearly that would make sense. But as you heard me say a number of times, if we can't find something good to do with our cash, we'll find a way to return it to shareholders. We have said publicly, we want to return about 1/3 of our cash flow to shareholders. That's kind of a stated objective and beyond that, just have to stay tuned.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Great, then. Helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George Staphos", "Thanks. A couple of follow-ons. A year or two ago, you started talking about using more, if you will, sustainably produced materials within your production processes and replacing carbon and that sort of thing, carbon-based materials in your processes. Can you comment at all on where those activities stand? And to the degree that it's having an effect on your P&L what that benefit seems to be? Either in recent quarters or what do you expect for this year or next?", "William Hickey", "Yes. That's a good question, George, is that we're in the market with several products that, reducing our resin consumption by up to 20% -- up to 30%, we're targeting 20%, particularly in shrink films, that product has been commercial. The core thinner product called CT-301 has been in the market for a year. We've introduced two other new versions of shrink film 501 and 701, which are in the market this year. We've actually introduced our first thinned down barrier bag in Europe early this year. We'll be coming out with a thinned down inflatable product kind of mid-year. We may have even a gauge-reduced Bubble Wrap product before the end of this year. And all of those, if you look at the amount of resin we buy, taking 20% of the material out is a pretty good sized number. But thanks for asking. We are moving -- we had a meeting with a management team and said how we can move faster. We have to make some investment in equipment. The investment's not a large dollar investment but it's a time and development investment. And I had a conversation with our head of R&D last week about what products can we accelerate that would have the most impact on resin consumption this year. So we are moving and thanks for asking the question.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Bill, is it a year away or five years away where you could see that these activities -- if you hold your base of business constant, which maybe a bit of a flaw in the analysis but let's use an assumption that you could take out 5% of your resin or 10% of your resin. How would you size the impact and time the impact?", "William Hickey", "Yes. Well, we use well over a billion pounds of resin. And it's right now rolled out in one of our businesses on a pretty large scale. But that business is less than $500 million. Some of the biggest opportunities are in shrink bags which is a very, very large business. And on the Inflatable business, where the savings is greater than 20%. I'm just trying to think of how to put it in terms of pounds. I would say though, by the end of 2012, and this is just an educated outlook, we could have 20% of our product fully converted. And that's a rough number. But why don't we look at it, George, and ask the question again in the second quarter.", "George Staphos", "Will do. All right guys, good luck. Talk to you soon.", "Operator", "The next question comes from that of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli and Company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. Just very quickly. As the price of natural gas is -- seems to be dropping. What could be the impact on your raw material cost? Or are they mostly from petroleum? Or is there a switch? If natural gas slows then more will be produced with natural gas, but then the amount obtained at the end of the process will be smaller, hence, price increases?", "William Hickey", "Yes. Well, Rosemarie, that's a wonderful question. A wonderful question which I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer, but I'll give you my take on it. The U.S. petrochemical feed stocks are produced from natural gas, which is about $4 a million cubic feet. The Europeans and the rest of the world tends to produce petrochemical feed stocks out of oil, out of the naphtha stream coming out of oil. Now, the historical relationship in energy equivalencies has been about 5:1 or 6:1 between oil and natural gas. Oil per barrel was generally 6x the price of natural gas. Right now, that ratio has gone to 25:1. It's going to 25:1. So the U.S. petrochemical producers are dealing with a very, very attractive low-cost input. But they're competing on a global market where their non-U.S. competitors are paying 25x for their input cost. So what you're finding is a combination of higher cost outside the U.S. and a weak U.S. dollar that a lot of the U.S. resin is being exported, and that's supporting higher prices in the U.S. That's the short answer.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. That is very helpful. Thank you. And if I may ask one last quick one. The volume in the Food Solution was down 6% in the U.S. and obviously, you had that account change. If you eliminate the impact of the account change, what did Food Solution actually do volume wise?", "William Hickey", "I think it was 8%, Rosemarie. If you take that out, it was 8% for the quarter. Which is where food solutions ought to be.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Plus 8%, if you take...", "William Hickey", "Plus 8%. Plus 8%. We have one more internet question, webcast. Let me read this and then we'll wrap up. \"What is the normalized level of cash balance post the Grace settlement?\" It's a lot less than $700 million, but I'll let Dave field that one.", "David Kelsey", "And Bill will probably think it's a lot less than the number I'm going to suggest. But, we probably run can the business with $50 million to $100 million of grease on the wheels. But we also have some parts of the world where we have cash that is trapped, either because it will be highly taxed to remove it from the country where it is. Or, in a case like Venezuela, we simply can't get it out in exchange for U.S. dollars. So when you factor that in as well, we probably move up above $100 million, to $100 million to $150 million. So it's significantly below where we are today, and it certainly gives us a lot of flexibility once we can put the Grace settlement in our rearview mirror.", "William Hickey", "Okay. Thank you, Dave. I do want to wrap up here and thank you all for your time and participation today. As I said earlier, the fundamentals of our business remain very solid and we're focusing on executing our 2011 goals and achieving our EPS guidance. Our ongoing economic recovery, our commitment to innovation and investment in a differentiated pipeline of solutions remains our focus. Recovery of higher resin costs remains an important priority and we continue to implement pricing actions to recover these costs as demonstrated in prior years. We believe that strong execution and a balanced approach will continue to drive improved results, allow us to achieve our long-term goals and create value for all our stakeholders. And it\u2019s for this and many other reasons that I continue to be proud to be a Sealed Air shareholder.

Christie, Treasurer and Interim Chief Financial Officer.", "[Operator Instructions] And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda Butler", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future, are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. And we encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to all business calls. Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors, and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial table that we have included in our earnings release.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William V. Hickey", "Thank you, Amanda, and good morning to everyone. Today's call marks the first discussion with investors following the close of the Diversey acquisition on October 3. As I commented earlier this month, the addition of Diversey marks the beginning of an exciting new era of opportunity for Sealed Air, our employees and our customers. And today I can say with pride that we are the new leader in food safety and security, facility hygiene and product protection. Protecting what you eat and drink, protecting the places you go and protecting the valuable products you use everyday. ", "As we noted in our press release earlier today, we have made solid strides in our integration planning process, have expanded the addressable areas for cost synergies and are in active discussions with customers and partners in expanding sales and revenue opportunities. We have a lot to get through on the call today, and I thought I would like to ensure that we have ample time for Q&A. I will spend the next few minutes highlighting our legacy Sealed Air third quarter 2011 business performance, and then Tod will detail key financial items. We will then review Diversey Holdings third quarter results, which are currently preliminary and unaudited. We will finish with our outlook for the balance of the year and then take your questions.", "We reported third quarter legacy Sealed Air 2011 earnings per share results of $0.41 per share, which compares to $0.43 in 2010. Excluding the $0.07 related to acquisition expenses, our adjusted earnings per share increased 12% over 2010's third quarter to $0.48. ", "Additionally, we reported a 2% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $196 million, and generated $127 million of free cash flow in the quarter. These achievements reflect solid fundamentals in our core business in a weakening economy, aided by favorable foreign exchange but driven by higher price and volume results, tight control of expenses and approximately $7 million in productivity benefits. Together, these factors helped to offset nearly $40 million in higher petrochemical raw material and freight cost in the third quarter. ", "I would like to point out that resin-based raw material cost were trending favorably in the third quarter on a sequential basis, but only at a very modest rate. In fact, our average price per pound improved only 2% sequentially in the third quarter, with the most notable price benefits coming in the month of September. ", "We expect to recognize additional benefits in the fourth quarter as we anticipate continued sequential improvements in resin cost. Nonetheless, our full 2011 average price per pound remains in the low teens percent higher than 2010 prices. In response to the higher input cost, we have been focusing on raising our selling prices to recover these higher costs. It has been particularly difficult in this slowing economy to recover higher input cost when demand has been tepid at best. We have had to step back from some volume to realize our pricing. Most of the stepping back was with price-focused buyers that do not always agree with our value proposition, but I am confident we can get these customers back anytime with an attractive price offer. In managing our business, we have been very sensitive to strategically balancing price actions and sales volumes across our portfolio. ", "Overall, the fundamentals of the business remained very solid in the quarter, with 10% reported top-line growth, or 4% increase on a constant dollar basis which includes the impact of foreign exchange. In fact, we achieved over a 3% constant dollar sales growth in all of our geographical regions around the world. ", "Developing regions grew over twice that rate, which is also higher than what we reported in the second quarter. We achieved a 3% improvement in price mix in the quarter, which demonstrated successful pricing campaigns across our segments. This benefit, combined with ongoing strong customer reception of our growth programs, developing region expansions and continued equipment and automation demand, continue to offset the slowing pace of economic growth seen in our core end markets during the third quarter. As a result, we realized the net 1% volume growth rate in this period.  In the interest of time, I'll briefly discuss the top-line results for our three key new businesses. In Food Packaging, price mix increased 4%, reflecting the benefits of prior pricing actions and contract adjustments. Reported volume growth was flat. However, we achieved 3% to 4% volume growth in Europe, Asia and Australia, New Zealand due to the expansion of our growth programs and increase in animal and dairy production in those markets, equipment sales in Europe and Australia and continued acceleration of our presence in developing regions around the world, most notably in Central and Eastern Europe and into the Middle East. ", "Latin America remained flat year-over-year, volume performance as Brazil's meat processing industry is only slowly starting to recover from higher domestic retail prices and an appreciating currency, which has limited exports. This factor offset the solid volume growth we did achieve in the northern cone countries, such as Colombia and Venezuela. ", "Finally, a 2% volume decline in North America reflected a small customer loss in Canada, which we noted in the second quarter, relatively flat animal production rates in the region and the anniversary of new contracts last year, which created a more challenging year-over-year comparison. Net, net, we believe that we substantially held volumes in the consumer challenged United States, and maintained or increased our market share. ", "In Food Solutions, price mix increased 4%, similar to what we saw in Food Packaging. However, volumes declined 1% solely on U.S. case-ready volumes, which continue to be impacted by last year's format switch by a major retailer, which we have previously discussed, and are in the process of backfilling. Otherwise, all other regions achieved good volume growth in the quarter. ", "We achieved a 6% volume increase in Australia and New Zealand, with strength in all product categories, and a 1% volume increase in Europe, largely on growth of our case-ready formats, BDF, Darfresh, Mirabella and in Vertical Pouch Packaging. ", "In Protective Packaging, price mix increased 3%, reflecting the benefits of our prior pricing actions, which are more pronounced in this quarter. Volumes also increased 3%, led by a 3% increase in North America due to strength in e-commerce and fulfillment markets and a large retail promotion in September. Asia volumes increased 13%, as export markets and domestic manufacturers continue to grow, although at a slower pace in the quarter. ", "European volumes were steady on a year-over-year basis during the quarter, primarily due to continuing economic uncertainty in that part of the world. Across all regions, we've seen solid growth in our new products such as NewAir I. B. Express, in our core product families including inflatables, Instapak foam in place, air cellular products and Bubble Wrap brand cushioning material. ", "Lastly, I'd like to jump to our consolidated developing region sales, which represented 17% of total revenue in the quarter. Net sales increased 15%, or 7% on a constant dollar basis. We achieved growth in several areas led by Latin America, where, if we exclude Brazil's results due to the issues in their meat industry, which I previously noted, Latin American sales increased 12%, or 7% on a constant dollar basis. The greatest area of strength was in our industrial business, where we achieved a 4% increase in volumes versus the prior-year, primarily from Mexican exports to the United States. ", "Our Food business also saw strong growth outside of Brazil, specifically in Mexico and the northern cone countries which include Colombia and Venezuela. ", "Our second largest area of growth was in China where sales grew 37%, or 32% on a constant dollar basis. Nearly half of this growth was due to favorable comparisons in our Medical business, which we noted in our press release. The balance of the growth in the quarter reflected ongoing demand for our Protective Packaging and Specialty Materials products from the export sector, largely computers, peripherals and consumer electronics, and from the Chinese domestic industrial sector. ", "Third, Central and Eastern Europe demonstrated a 16% sales increase, or 6% on a constant dollar basis which was largely Food business associated with the ongoing penetration and automation of food customers in that part of the world. ", "Finally, when looking specifically at Southeast Asia and India combined, sales grew 25%, or 17% on a constant dollar basis. This high rate of growth was driven by both Food and Industrial business gains, as we continue to accelerate our presence as part of our growth programs, which should also benefit from building on Diversey's established infrastructure in that region. ", "So overall, despite some discrete lower volume performance in certain areas of the world, we're actively working to backfill or have determined to be nonstrategic from a portfolio perspective. We are pleased to see definite areas of sustained strength, demand for new solutions and real returns on our growth programs in the developing parts of the world. ", "Taken together, we have created a balanced approach which is serving us well during uncertain economic periods, and is still allowing us to achieve solid free cash flow and earnings growth. To discuss the financial results in more detail, I'll pass the balance of the third quarter commentary to Tod.", "Tod S. Christie", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional details on third quarter results and the impact of foreign currency on our reported results. I'll also address details of our operating expenses and operating income, as well as key balance sheet, free cash flow and liquidity items. ", "As you may have noted in our press release, foreign currency was a big factor in our third quarter results. The weaker U.S. dollar contributed to higher sales and expenses for the quarter, as we typically source materials and production in the same regions. ", "In the third quarter, the euro and other currencies such as the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real recorded double-digit increases in value against the U.S. dollar. This resulted in a $71 million favorable impact on our sales, and had a proportionate impact on our operating profit. ", "Operating expenses, excluding costs related to the acquisition and integration of Diversey, were $182 million and were even with last year on a constant dollar basis. Operating expenses, as a percentage of net sales declined by 70 basis points, as incremental sales and marketing cost to support our sales growth were offset by lower variable incentive compensation expenses. ", "Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter, excluding acquisition-related costs, was $154 million, or $6 million higher than last year. Excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, operating profit would have been relatively flat compared to last year. ", "Our interest expense was $4 million less in the quarter compared with last year, which was due to our December 2010 redemption of $150 million of our 12% senior notes. We reported an $8 million increase in other income and expense in the quarter as compared to prior year. This increase was due to gains that we recorded on foreign currency forward contracts we entered into for various tax planning and intercompany loan transactions in preparation for the closing of the Diversey acquisition. We have excluded these gains which would have equated to $0.02 of higher EPS from our adjusted EPS results. ", "Now I'd like to turn your attention to some key balance sheet free cash flow and liquidity items. Cash and cash equivalents were $800 million at the end of September, up $95 million from June 30. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $21 million. We anticipate our free cash flow generation will remain solid in the fourth quarter of 2011, as our receivables and inventory balances continue to decline, in line with the pattern of past years. ", "Our receivables decreased $14 million to $717 million on a reported basis during the quarter. Excluding the decrease attributable to foreign currency translation, our receivables would have increased $18 million or 3%, in line with constant dollar revenue growth in the quarter. ", "Inventories decreased $26 million on a reported basis during the quarter. Excluding the decrease attributable to foreign currency translation, our inventories would have remained flat in the quarter. We expect our inventory balance to decline in the fourth quarter of the year, in line with the pattern of past years. Inventory days on hand was unchanged at September 30, compared with June 30. ", "Accounts payable increased by $16 million in the quarter, primarily due to Diversey acquisition-related expenses. ", "We generated strong free cash flow of $127 million in the third quarter from a combination of earnings, and the currency translation benefits on our working capital balances, largely offsetting the [Audio Gap] translation on our second quarter free cash flow. For the year-to-date, free cash flow was $187 million, and we are on track to achieve our guidance of $225 million to $275 million for the full year. And now I'll turn the call back to Bill to highlight Diversey's preliminary third quarter results and discuss our fourth quarter expectations.", "William V. Hickey", "Tod, thank you. Earlier today, we included a supplement in our third quarter earnings release which highlights some preliminary and unaudited financial results for Diversey for the third quarter. It's clear that Diversey still was an independent company during the third quarter, and are not part of Sealed Air's results. However, we understand that our investors are interested in how Diversey's business progressed through the quarter, and specifically how their European operations might have been affected by the economic climate in that region. ", "As you saw on a reported basis, Diversey generated $825 million in sales which declined approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis versus 2010. This reflected 3% lower volumes which were partially [Audio Gap] favorable price mix. These results were largely due to weaknesses in Japan, following the effect of the natural disasters in that country. And in Europe, due to weaknesses in one end market and to exit from a nonstrategic toll manufacturing business. But overall, their results were tempered by their diversified end markets and geographic mix, as well as from the rising benefits from contractual price amendments and pricing actions implemented in the first half of 2011 to recover rising raw material cost. These costs appear to have peaked in the third quarter. ", "Specifically in Europe, Diversey recorded a 2% decline in constant dollar sales from 3% lower volumes, which were partially offset by 1% higher price. I am pleased to report that volumes held up in most of Diversey's European end markets. ", "The Food and Beverage business realized both volume and price growth, while the institutional and lodging end markets saw a nearly a 4% decline in volumes. This volume decline reflected weak economic conditions, and reduced spending in the public sector, which represents a large customer base in the institutional end markets in certain countries like Switzerland and Denmark. ", "We expect continued year-over-year volume and price growth in the fourth quarter for the Food and Beverage business in Europe, but are cautious about any near-term improvement in institutional and lodging due to ongoing uncertainty in the region's economy. ", "Additionally, credit agreement EBITDA declined on a year-over-year basis due to the timing of recovery of raw material cost and underabsorbed overhead, relating to reduced volumes in the period. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, pricing benefits are expected to increase, as raw material prices ease, helping to improve margin performance in the fourth quarter. ", "When we look at the prospects for our new combined company in the fourth quarter, we believe that we will achieve year-over-year volume growth similar to the rate reported in the third quarter at legacy Sealed Air. Price mix is expected to continue to improve and offer margin expansion, as raw material cost continue to ease sequentially. This will help further drive adjusted EBITDA growth and reinforce solid cash flow generation. This improves our exiting ample liquidity and our ability to deleverage rapidly to increase earnings growth. ", "As I noted in the press release, when we achieved a net debt level below our target of $4.5 billion, we expect to return a portion of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or through share repurchases, adding further value to investors. ", "For the legacy Sealed Air business, on a stand-alone basis, excluding the impact of Diversey, we have revised our full-year 2011 EPS guidance to $1.70 to $1.75, to reflect the slower rate of economic growth anticipated in the fourth quarter. ", "We are aware that there is interest in the estimated combined company results for the fourth quarter of 2011 due to the limited pro forma information available at this time. As such, we have provided a few metrics which build upon legacy Sealed Air's core forecast and incorporates our estimates for the Diversey reportable segment in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the combination of the two companies in the fourth quarter will generate net sales between $1.11 billion to $2.18 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA in the $335 million to $345 million range, and maintaining an ongoing asset-light model, with capital expenditures in the range of $45 million to $55 million for the quarter. ", "As we move into the fourth quarter and a new era for Sealed Air as the leader in protection, we're excited about the ongoing developments identified by our broader organization and our integration planning process, our improved outlook on cost synergies and the daily discussions occurring with customers, which are yielding additional possible revenue synergies and product development concepts. ", "We have noted that we have over 10 development concepts in hand, and we are working their way through our R&D process, and expect to see at least two of them introduced in early 2012. This adds to the GE-awarded Diversey alliance announced a few weeks ago and the VSS hand washing solution currently in pilot at several healthcare facilities around the country. We have not provided or revised synergy range at this time, as we are evaluating additional synergy opportunities during our integration planning process. ", "We do want to emphasize however, our confidence in achieving and exceeding the initial commitment of $50 million cost synergy run rate in 2013. And now Tod will highlight a few items that occurred immediately after the acquisition closing that will impact our upcoming fourth quarter results. Tod?", "Tod S. Christie", "Thanks, Bill. In connection with the acquisition of Diversey on October 3, we finalized the syndication of $3.8 billion in debt that includes $2.3 billion in secured term loans and $1.5 billion in new senior unsecured notes, as well as a new $700 million revolving credit facility. The average cost of our new debt at closing was 5.8%, or 6.2% if including previously existing debt. As a result of these transactions, we have approximately $5.2 billion in total debt on our balance sheet, or a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.4x. ", "Our cash balances, new revolver and accounts receivable securitization facility comprised approximately $1.5 billion of committed liquidity, providing ample funds to address any near-term obligations. ", "I'd like to reiterate that we have a strong track record of free cash flow generation and deleveraging through the economic cycle. We plan to maintain our dividend, which is roughly $100 million a year, and use substantially all remaining free cash flow to repay our debt obligations and delever our balance sheet. In fact, we've already paid our 2011 installments due under our new credit facilities, and we anticipate paying all of our 2012 installments by the end of 2011 using free cash flow generated in the fourth quarter. This suggests a preliminary 2012 interest expense range of $385 million to $395 million, which includes approximately $320 million of cash interest expense, $45 million of interest accruals on our Grace settlement liability and approximately $25 million of amortized transaction fees and the original issued discount or OID on our debt. ", "In addition, we plan to opportunistically invest in our businesses to further enhance our free cash flow generation in the future. ", "In summary, we remain well-positioned to fund the day-to-day operations of our new combined company, return cash to our shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend and prepay our outstanding term loans. We also stand ready to fund the pending W.R. Grace settlement upon Grace's emergence from bankruptcy, although the funding date remains uncertain. Now I'll turn the call back to Bill and to your questions.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. Thank you. Before taking questions, I'd just like to make a few comments about the Sealed Air share price. In my personal opinion, Sealed Air shares are undervalued, and I attribute that to three reasons:", "One is a number of investors are selling or have sold a substantial portion of their holdings of Sealed Air. Many of these investors may have been anticipating a liquidity event or a different capital allocation. I want to assure you that I continue to hold all of my Sealed Air shares, and plan to hold them as long as I am active in the management of the company;", "Second is information about Diversey is not well known among investors, as it was a privately held company. And due to the complexity of the transaction and the purchase accounting process, we have not been able to provide timely information to investors to help them understand the Diversey business and we'll try to do a better job at that;", "Three, the rationale for the transaction was not as obvious to investors, and acquisition and packaging would have been more understandable. We chose not to consolidate the past, as represented by acquiring more mature packaging companies, but to invent that -- the future, by bringing new solutions and new values to the global food chains, as well as packaging and cleaning and sanitation. ", "Also, as I looked at several transactions announced in the packaging space in the last few months, and the purchase prices of those acquisitions in the high 8s or the low 9x EBITDA multiples, I am comfortable with the price we paid for the Diversey acquisition, which has a higher incremental margin than almost any packaging company I've seen in my 30 years. ", "I am committing to our investors that we will put all of our efforts in the incentive compensation for the senior management team, into delivering on our commitments for Diversey, and in the near term to begin providing investors with more information about Diversey and the combined company going forward. ", "With those comments, operator, I'm now happy to take questions via the telephone or via the text from our webcast participants.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", ".", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess a couple of questions on Diversey, and thanks for the details and, and the affirmation at the end as well. Selling barrier packaging for food and selling cleaning solutions to food processors in a number of other end markets. They're very technical sales as we've learned about them and my guess would be that in many cases, maybe in all cases, the sale has gone to someone -- to two different people within the organization. Given what you know about Diversey now,3- plus months 4  months, where do you think -- what gives you the most confidence on generating revenue synergies within the business and then I had a follow on.", "William V. Hickey", "Sure, yes, now you've probably asked a question a lot of people have been asking is, is we basically meet -- we basically needed the customers' factories. I mean, we're all in the customers' factories and the common science between the two of us is food science and microbiology. We have to understand what happens in the package, and Diversey's job is to prevent any contamination from getting into the package. Right now, those have been 2 discrete functions, coincidentally in most of our customers, they report to the same person, the person will be responsible for quality or production or for the facilities, all have overall responsibility for both the packaging and the hygiene. So oftentimes, we are either calling on the same person, or calling on people who report to the same person. And interestingly enough, most of our customers look at both as an important part of the quality and the safety of their products. And what we are in the process of reinventing is how that customer keeps their food clean and safe and sanitary from the time they process it into the package. Because what we don't want have happen and it has happened, George, on numerous occasions, is contamination gets into the package, goes through the food chain, causes significant amount of turmoil at the retail and the customer level. And oftentimes, we are brought into the claim. We are invariably brought into the claim by the customer as being part of the problem, and oftentimes it's not. Oftentimes it's what's happened before the product's gotten into the package. So the answer is, and we'll talk more about just it in the interest of time, but there's a lot of opportunity to create a seamless food safety process which could prevent a lot of the things that you'd read about in newspapers from cantaloupes to ground turkey.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that, Bill. I guess the other question would be you -- around mile markers. You've announced some initial progress and wins like GE Water deal. Before having this conference call, and I guess we will in 6 months from now, what are the goals you have for the business, either from a number of new products or new customers or volume growth that will, if you achieve them, make you even more confident that this was the right transaction for Sealed Air and for that matter, its shareholders?", "William V. Hickey", "Okay, George, just quickly. In kind of 6 months, I think what you'll see, you'll probably two new products that go out in early 2012. You will probably see some validation of a substantial portion of the synergy number. You will see some new sales on our target of kind of $75 million that we said we target near term. Go out 12 months from now, and you should see realization of $50 million plus in synergies. You'll see some number of revenue in the $50 million to $75 million range, and you will see a number of, probably I'll just target 5 new products that basically combine what we do to our customers at their factories. Those are the 2 mile markers I'll give you. Six and 12.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In your press release and commentary, you broke out EBITDA guidance for 4Q between $335 million and $345 million. At the end of your press release, you noted that Diversey is $110 million to $120 million out of that, so that kind implies legacy Sealed Air EBITDA of $225 million, if you use the midpoint. So if that math is right, this compares to EBITDA $196 million during the third quarter. Shouldn't EPS be up a lot more, sequentially, for 4Q?", "William V. Hickey", "I'll let Tod do that.", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes, let me give you an example Ghansham, I used the lower end of the range, but you could apply it throughout the range. So let's say if we start doing your calculation with standalone EBITDA for Sealed Air of $216 million. That's on the legacy business. So from that I would -- I subtract D&A and non-cash comp, that's -- put that in the $44 million, $45 million range. Interest expense in the same sort of range. That gets you a pretax of about $128 million, and then we do our 27% tax rate and that gets you down to a net earnings of around $93 million or -- and that's kind of a $0.52 range for the quarter.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much, Tod, for that. On a -- I guess a follow-up question on Diversey, that 3% volume decline, how -- can you parse out the impact between Japan, Europe? And also, how big is food and beverage for Europe versus lodging?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, Ghansham, we don't have all the details on Diversey. I said we didn't run the business for the third quarter. I mean, I can tell you that the lodging business is bigger than the food and beverage, but I don't have a number now with we can we can obviously get that, as we go forward, and the Japan business, pretty good-sized business, about $300 million, so it's about 10% of the Diversey business and it was off, probably close to double-digit.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Does sound like you're making pretty good traction on some of these new ones in North America, but that does sound like it's independent of Sealed Air. So I'm going to get a sense how quickly you're going to be able to leverage on the relationships that you have, and win new business from that point going forward?", "William V. Hickey", "I'm not sure I got the question, how quick are we leveraging the relationships?", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I mean, it sounds like -- it seems like you're making pretty good traction in the U.S, Diversey pieces on your new project wins. That's obviously independent of Sealed Air, so I just want to get a sense how quickly will be able to leverage your existing relationships to win incremental business going forward?", "William V. Hickey", "We actually are. We actually are. We actually, interestingly enough, Philip, we're actually getting faster traction in Europe than we are in the U.S. Diversey's much bigger in Europe. They're much better known, so the combination of Sealed Air and Diversey is more widely recognized in Europe as a great combination. Diversey's got still a relatively small business here in the U.S, but those introductions and relationships are proceeding.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. I mean --", "William V. Hickey", "I met with 3 Diversey customers just last week and they're all excited about things we can do together.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and can you remind us how seasonal this business is?", "William V. Hickey", "What, I'm sorry?", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you remind us how seasonal Diversey is?", "William V. Hickey", "Seasonal, it's pretty flat, it's like 24, 26, 23.", "It's like 25%, plus or minus 2% or 3%.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so I mean, the guidance that you provided for Q4 I mean it was approxied -- that's probably a good rate for the full year, absent of demand and price cost, right? Is that fair?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Thanks for the guidance that you've given us so far on the Diversey interest expense impact next year. I was hoping you could talk about 2 other numbers. It looks like given their footprint that your effective tax rate would probably go up, and could you give us some guidance as to sort of where in the 30s that probably goes to? And then secondly, talk about kind of with the ongoing CapEx will be, based on your fourth quarter indication, it seems like we should assume something around $200 million for '12 and beyond?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, I'll let Tod untie the first part and we'll figure out how we'll do the second part.", "Tod S. Christie", "Hey Chip, the -- as I think you know, we have not yet disclosed a -- an ETR for the combined business. We are currently in the process of working through that, and we will be able to provide much more detail on that one when we file the 8-K following the closing. We have -- we've used an indicative rate of 35%, but I would just caution you that there's a lot of detailed analysis that we need to do on a country basis to get to the appropriate rate going forward.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "And on the CapEx?", "William V. Hickey", "On the CapEx, we're sort of looking at $180 million to $190 million. We'll come in under $200 million. My personal view is $175 million to $190 million. But we're in the $180 million to $190 million range right now.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. And just a quick follow-up. As you look at the free cash generation that you were expecting when you announced the deal back in earlier this year. Has anything really changed, in terms of how you view the timing of getting your -- to your net debt ratio targets that you laid out, especially given that there's been a little bit of softness in the economy globally in the last few months?", "William V. Hickey", "That's about all I can say is the economy, Chip. I mean, the interest rates are a little bit higher than we thought they'd be back in June, and that's, we figure, tens of millions per year, so that's an impact along the way. And then the economy, I mean we get a good economy, we'll probably be ahead of that schedule, and slow economy, we're pretty closer and maybe a little bit behind, but not much.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you.", "Tod S. Christie", "The one thing I would add, Chip, is that if you look back in 2009, when we had a significantly slowing economy, we still generated great cash flow because of our working capital performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Bill, could you give us some little more details on the new products you are expecting to go out the door at the beginning of 2012? And then if you go out to the front, you mentioned for the next 12 months period. Do you -- could you give us a feel as to your expectations, in terms of size and profitability? How quickly can they be deployed into the marketplace?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, well let me tell you, Rosemarie.  I'll tell you the two we've announced already, the alliance with GE Water and VSS which is piloting a couple of hospitals. I'd really not like to tip my hat, as what we're going to do here, I mean, if you've seen us some -- we want to be first, and we wanted to be both ahead of the folks in the packaging side and on the chemical side, and I just would just say Rosemarie, just stay tuned.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "All right. And then, if I may, ask you a little more details on the industries that are served by our protective packaging. Can you give us a feel for the trends? You said something which I was confused about, but that could be my problem. You said that you have seen slowing pace of the economic growth in the middle of the third quarter. And yet you also said that you saw a pickup in September, which is just at the tail end of the third quarter. So if you could help me understand what is actually going on and what you see in the different markets you served?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, on the protective side, I mean, we did see kind of late August, early September. There was a slowing. One of the things that I have mentioned to people is the order pattern of customers has been the most sporadic I've seen in many, many years, is customers who typically order every week or every two weeks, will now not do it because they're managing their inventory, and concerned about the future. So one month, actually, one month was good, the next one's a little slow. But what the pickup in September was, one of the large retailers had a promotion on consumer bubble wrap, and that really drove a lot of business in protective at the end of September.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And could you touch on the other markets that you serve on the protective side?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, the protective side, I think, are more in the commentary of the press release. We saw good business and e-commerce and fulfillment. As more and more people, I hate to go back to the 2000 tech boom, but e-commerce and fulfillment is gradually gaining share of the consumer dollars. And we've got some ties to some of the major companies, if you read the FedEx comments about what they have seen. We are beneficiaries of that. So the more you order online, the better it helps our business, Rosemarie so thank you.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes, Bill, actually want to follow on what Rosemarie was asking there, because the volume in protective packaging was actually a little better than I might have expected it, it seems like if we go back to '08 and '09, that was really where you saw your business drop off. We've seen a lot of guys who were in industrial packaging report some weak numbers recently. Can you talk about that a little bit?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, no, Mark. We've been out there with several new products. We've got a new -- within the last nine months, we've had a new paper product.  We got a new inflatable product. We've got a new biodegradable loose fill product. We're continuing to kind of crank out some of the new products. And I think that's helped us, I don't want to use the word gain share, but keep volumes up, and we've seen some of the competitive environment be impacted by their own needs for either cash flow, or raising funds and we take in, use our strength in the marketplace.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "If you were to look at, let's say Europe in that segment of your business, Bill, and Europe seems to be kind of the weak spot out there right now. What are volumes look like over in Europe in protective packaging?", "William V. Hickey", "I think Europe and protective packaging, if you exclude one of our product lines where we had some supply problems. We're up about 3% in Europe in Q3, and that's the core protective business, the Bubble Wrap, the Instapak, the foam, the mailers, that's up 3%. We did have a supply problem on one of our shrink film product lines, so that was actually down. But the protective business was basically up 3% in Europe.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just stepping over briefly to the food business. One of your competitors was out this morning. They had reported pretty weak volumes in the third quarter. Your volumes actually look to be pretty decent in food. Any thoughts there?", "William V. Hickey", "We work hard to get sales every day, Mark.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I realized that visibility is very limited right now into Europe and that's sort of the biggest geographic region for Diversey. But can you share with us how you're thinking about the base case outlook for price and mix and volume for Diversey next year?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, that level of detail, I think it will have to wait until we get -- we peel back the onion a bit further, but we do -- I mean, Europe's got to get resolved. I mean, I think we're all looking forward to some resolution in Europe. And I think once it's settled, I think Europe will probably have a very slow growth period for a year or two, and I'll leave it at that for now.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Bill, can you comment on the trends you're seeing for specialty resins relative to the commodity resins that you're buying?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. Specialty resins are pretty flat. Commodity resins are continuing to come down in the month of October. But specialty resins I know of one that's actually gone up. The rest have been pretty stable.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Bill, last question for Tod. If you were to think about the pro forma share count for next year. If we took the legacy number, added the 31.7 million shares issued, and then somehow found a way to account for the stock appreciation rights that are also going to Diversey Executives, is that the right way to think about the pro forma share accounts for 2012?", "Tod S. Christie", "The first part is. So you should end up with about $210 million, which is the 160-plus that Sealed Air had before acquiring Diversey, adding the $31.7 million, and then we include in our diluted share count, the $18 million that we'll eventually issue in connection with the Grace settlement. The stock appreciation rights are actually cash settled. So it's referenced to the stock price, but no new shares will be issued.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And a cash outflows related to that, is that over time? Essentially those that -- that cash outlay is made, how is that going to actually flow through?", "Tod S. Christie", "It's over time after divest, and as people exercise.", "Operator", ".", "Our next question comes from the line of Gil Alexandre of Darphil Associates.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "Could you remind me when you to hope to get to your $4.5 billion debt level? And can you give any color to what's happening for the Grace settlement?", "William V. Hickey", "The first one may be easier than the second one, okay.  We're looking at getting into that in 2013. And the Grace settlement, I hope is long before that. But you know it, the judge had the hearing on June 28, and we still have not had the judge's ruling as far as I know.", "Gilbert Alexandre", "Do they need any more information?", "William V. Hickey", "I don't know, but we'd be happy to volunteer. I understand that Grace has actually said publicly that will not happen in 2011.", "Operator", ".", "Our last question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Bill, regarding the gross margin, you are expecting sequential improvement as your price increases are gaining traction, and your raw material costs are coming down. Do you think you've -- by -- that in the fourth quarter, you can reach the fourth quarter level of last year, which was, I know, wait,  I'm not going to go into these kind of details, but just as a point of reference, it was 27.7%?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, we should be -- yes, we'll have price going into the fourth quarter. We'll have resins favorable in the fourth quarter. I look for being well over 27%, so it will be closer as we're having -- I haven't got the numbers right here in front of me, but it ought to be pretty close.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And then by 2012, I'm just looking at Sealed Air legacy, then we should be showing some year-over-year improvement on the margin -- on the gross margin side? Unless something changes, obviously?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, yes. I'm looking for, hopefully, some stability in the petrochemical market.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And still on that kind of a question, on the SG&A side, is that 14.6% of revenues a sustainable level, or was that because you really cut costs dramatically and some will have to come back?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, if you look at where we said we wanted to be, we wanted to be 15% or less, and now you combine us with Diversey, it runs around 32%, so we'll look at a new number going forward. But clearly, we're going to try to manage this business on a low-cost model.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay and then lastly if I may, as you have been introducing one another to some of your existing customers, has any new orders resulted from that, or any new customers signed up?", "William V. Hickey", "There is one that we just gotten, and it's about $4.5 million. The others are still on their way, and we'll have more to report at the end of the fourth quarter. I do want to, Rosemarie, if I could excuse you, to take the calls over the Internet. I've got, okay, I'm trying to get the screen here for, what's coming up. Did customers defer some purchases, the sharp decline in raws in September, please directionally approximate the negative impact on sales for your various divisions in Q3 and the potential benefit to Q4. I'm not aware of any meaningful decline or delay of customer orders in September. Actually, as I said, mentioned earlier, one of the large retailers had a promotion in September. So actually, orders were a little bit better in September than we would have expected. So no sign of deferred sales in the third quarter of significance. And so we expect the fourth quarter to track reasonably consistently. Next question, from the Internet is what were Diversey's sales, EBITDA and operating income in Q4 2010? Tod, do you have that?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes, Bill. The sales were $803 million. The reported EBITDA was $76 million and operating income was $43 million.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. Next question is, does total debt of $5.2 billion include the Grace liability. Tod?", "Tod S. Christie", "It does not. The Grace liability is currently about $820 million. But what we typically do is look at our net debt balances, because we have retained more than the amount of cash that we need to operate the business on the balance sheet. So we finished out the third quarter with about $800 million, so that essentially offsets the amount of the Grace liability, so the net debt ends up being the same $5.2 billion.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay, the next question is, are the Davis funds done with the selling Sealed Air shares, I really don't know the answer and really not prepared to comment on it. And number -- next question coming over the webcast is, the Diversey transaction accretive to Sealed Air next year? Tod?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes, on a cash EPS basis, the answer is yes. That's -- I referred earlier to the indicative tax rate that we've been using at 35%. So on that basis, it is accretive. But again I caution you that, that we're still developing our final expectations for the tax rate. I'd also just want to point out that we've learned from investors that there are various different definitions of cash EPS. So just to clarify, what we are now using as cash EPS is our adjusted EBITDA, less cash interest and cash taxes, and less CapEx and then divided by our diluted shares outstanding.", "William V. Hickey", "Right, okay. I think, operator, that covers the end of our questions. So I want to thank everyone for your time and participation. I think we're at the beginning of an exciting era as the new leader in protection, which I believe will bring tremendous value to our customers, our employees and our shareholders.", "Looking ahead, we've got solid business fundamentals, good growth momentum, a great R&D platform and a growing joint list of development concepts and tremendous untapped opportunities. ", "We have ample liquidity, solid free cash flow and are actively deleveraging to drive value creation. I remind everyone in 1989, we went through a similar deleveraging transaction, and it was very clear in my mind at that time, that every $1 of debt we repaid becomes $1 that belongs to the shareholders. And we will do that as quickly and as rapidly as we can in 2011 and '12. So thank you very much for taking the time to listen to us today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Unknown Analyst", "Operator", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Sealed Air conference call discussing the company's fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results. This call is being recorded. Here in the call today, we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tod S. Christie, Treasurer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda H. Butler", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone.", "Before we begin our call today, I'd like to remind you that the statements made during this call states management's outlook or predictions for the future, are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. And we encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call as well. Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors, and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures which do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial table that we have included in our earnings release.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?", "William V. Hickey", "Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. During today's call, I will discuss our 2011 earnings and our sales performance results. Tod will then provide more detail on our financial results, liquidity measures, key balance sheet items, and then we will highlight our 2011-2014 Integration and Optimization Program, which we noted in our earnings release earlier today. I will then discuss our outlook for 2012, and we will follow with questions from both the phone lines and from our webcast participants, who are invited to text in their questions. As our release included a fair amount of data and color, including the use of a standard or conventional adjusted EPS metric along with a cash EPS metric, we will try to keep our prepared remarks brief and move to our Q&A session promptly.", "This morning, we recorded our legacy Sealed Air full year 2011 adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 per share, which represents a 6% increase over the $1.60 of adjusted EPS we achieved in 2010, and within our guidance range of $1.70 to $1.75 earnings per share. ", "For the purposes of looking at the legacy Sealed Air results, we have excluded all of the impacts of the Diversey acquisition, which closed on October 3 of last year. Our legacy Sealed Air earnings per share results reflect solid performance in a challenging economic environment while we completed the Diversey acquisition and began the integration process in the fourth quarter. We attribute our legacy Sealed Air annual earnings growth to a number of factors, which include the steady focus we have maintained on our strategic growth programs, which held our volume performance above peer levels at a full-year volume growth rate of 2%, even as the global economic recovery slowed most notably in the second half of the year. Our strong R&D pipeline and the incremental launch of nearly 40 new products in 2011 resulted in a 200 basis point increase in the mix of new products as a percent of net sales, which now stands at 17%.", "Additionally, the developing regions of the world provided good overall growth with full-year sales growth of 10% on a reported basis or 7% on a constant dollar basis. This growth has increased the developing regions' sales mix of the total company to 18% of consolidated net sales versus 16% in 2010. And as you'll remember, this is up from the very low teens a number of short years ago.", "Thirdly, cost mitigation continued to be a core theme as we effectively managed inflationary pressures and raw materials with appropriate pricing actions and other operational initiatives. As a result, we recovered substantially all of our petrochemical base cost incurred in 2011 with a price/mix performance of 3% or approximately $120 million of positive price variance in the year. We also continued to generate productivity benefits of approximately $30 million per year through our supply chain emphasis on continuing improvement and strategic procurement programs.  Tod will touch a little bit of this in more detail during his comments.", "As a result, the combination of solid business model fundamentals, extreme strong team focus on our long-term strategic objectives, even while navigating challenging economic times, and effectively managing cost price spread to maximize profitability, these 3 factors have allowed us to continue to generate solid free cash flow and prepay our bank debt, all value-generating achievements that we intend to build upon in the year ahead.", "Let me spend a few minutes discussing, specifically, the results and highlights of the fourth quarter. In early December, we provided a mid-quarter review of our constant dollar sales performance through the month of November. At that time, we indicated that we were seeing positive constant dollars sales growth in most businesses and most regions. However, rates of growth were generally slowing on a sequential basis, but nevertheless still tracking above our peer group. Our final fourth quarter constant dollar sales results generally held to the performance levels seen in mid-quarter, except in European, Middle East, and Africa, EMA region. However, we had challenging year-over-year volume growth comparisons in our Food Solutions and Food Packaging business where we realized high single-digit percent rate growth in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "We also strategically balanced the price/mix in our portfolio as we sought to recover residual resin cost, and opted to exit certain accounts in the quarter. Overall though, the EMA region, which represents about 37% of our sales mix, showed good resilience in the fourth quarter due to the overall defensive profile of our business. Most Sealed Air segments generated positive constant dollars sales except for Protective Packaging, and Diversey constant dollars sales were flat for the region in the quarter, if including Diversey in the year-over-year comparison. As Europe and EMA region is a concern to the investors due to the ongoing economic uncertainty over the financial issues in Greece and other parts of Europe, I'd like to point out that the EMA region on a pro forma region full year 2011 basis, including the results of Diversey, performed in a steady fashion, with combined company sales effectively flat compared to 2010. Today, Diversey represents approximately 55% of our EMA region sales, and this segment declined approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, thus demonstrating its defensive profile. This slight decline was due to an estimated 2% constant dollar decline in institutional cleaning and laundry applications, which were partially offset by a 3% constant dollar increase in food and beverage end markets due to our ongoing growth in the beverage sector. This EMA Diversey trend was in line with third quarter performance results as weak economic conditions in the region have impacted institutional cleaning demand, and challenging cash and carry business, which uses big-box store outlets to sell consumer brand cleaning solutions to small business owners.", "Now at this time, I'd like to pass the call to Tod Christie to discuss the fourth quarter financial results and the integration program in more detail.", "Tod S. Christie", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results, and I'll also address key details of the balance sheet free cash flow and liquidity items as well as our integration and optimization plan.", "As you've seen in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA was $245 million in the quarter, which was a $51 million increase over last year but less than we anticipated. Legacy Sealed Air's adjusted EBITDA was $198 million or 15.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter compared with $194 million or 16% last year.  ", "As we've indicated previously, raw material costs peaked in the second quarter. Our prior pricing actions and moderating raw material costs in the latter half of the year combined to yield a favorable price cost spread of approximately $18 million in the fourth quarter. And in fact, we were able to recover about 80% of the increased raw material and freight costs that we absorbed for the full year. Raw material costs for our Diversey segment are subject to different market factors and peaked in the third quarter, remaining there through the remainder of the year, resulting in negative price cost spread and lower adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter than we originally anticipated. We expect that the effect of our pricing -- prior pricing actions throughout our business will carry over into 2012 and provide us with additional benefits in the first quarter.", "Now I'll turn your attention to free cash flow and liquidity items. Our free cash flow was $354 million in 2011, above our target of $225 million to $275 million for the full year. Changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in a net use of cash of $42 million for the year, as increases from business growth were partially offset by benefits from various working capital improvement initiatives throughout the company.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $723 million at December 31, down $76 million from September 30, 2011. During the quarter, we used $33 million of cash to pay for acquisition and integration costs related to Diversey; pay dividends of $21 million; and pay $12 million for 2 small acquisitions. As of December 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.5 billion. Our net debt was $5.2 billion at December 31 after repaying $100 million of debt. We continue to target the use of a substantial majority of our free cash flow for debt repayment after providing for our dividend payment and restructuring obligations. And we are poised to pay the first quarter 2013 installment on our bank debt as we continue to target staying a year ahead on our bank loan repayments.", "In summary, we remain well positioned to fund day-to-day operations of our new combined company, return cash to our shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend and prepay our outstanding term loans. As you may have noticed, approximately 10 days ago, the U.S. District Court of Delaware, in the W.R. Grace bankruptcy, denied all objections that had been filed and confirmed Grace's plan of reorganization in its entirety. While this is a very positive step, the District Court rulings remain subject to further appeals before W.R. Grace's plan of reorganization can become effective. ", "Our integration teams have been working diligently on our integration and optimization program, which has been outlined in our press release. We now anticipate $100 million of annual cost synergies in 2013, which is twice our original estimate. These cost synergies are expected to be equally split between cost of sales and SG&A. We're continuing to focus on additional upside cost-saving opportunities and we will provide updates as the plan progresses. We also have a high level of activity and enthusiasm on the commercial side and our sales teams are making joint customer calls and responding to tenders as we work towards our revenue synergy targets.", "And now I'll turn the call back to Bill to highlight our 2012 full year guidance.", "William V. Hickey", "Thanks, Tod. Let's look ahead to 2012.", "The coming year, our management team and employees are focused on 3 key objectives for the year: one, achieving successful integration of Diversey to maximize our synergies and long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders; two, manage our own [ph]  business to maximize cash flow and reduce our debt; and three, continue to grow our business by serving customers globally with innovative solutions and expanding our reach in developing regions.", "As you saw in our press release earlier today, we have provided EPS guidance to you in both a conventional adjusted EPS metric, which only excludes restructuring and onetime special items. In addition, we have provided an adjusted cash EPS metric, which we introduced in December. This metric additionally excludes the amortization of all intangibles, non-cash interest expense and non-cash taxes. We believe these 2 metrics present our financial results quite clearly and convey the strength of our operational performance and the strong cash-generating profile of our business, necessary metrics to measure our achievements to our key objectives.", "We believe the successful execution of our objectives in 2012 will generate a conventional adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.60 per share, or to put those numbers on an adjusted cash EPS basis, of $2.10 to $2.20 per share. ", "Based on the level of detail we have provided in our earnings release, I will not repeat each guidance point on this call, but we would like to highlight that we're anticipating approximately 4% to 5% constant dollar sales growth in 2012 from a pro forma 2011 sales baseline of $8.1 billion. We also are expecting approximately 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which results in approximately something less than a $200 million reduction in our top line. As a result, this translates into our outlined top line guidance range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion in 2012. For reference points, we watched the euro go from about $1.41 per euro to about $1.31, and that difference is what I'm referring to when I address the impact of $200 million on the top line. We also are expecting key raw material input cost to rise on the average of low to mid single-digit range for the year. And we expect to continue to achieve positive price mix in 2012 and similar unit volume as we achieved, on average, in 2011.", "Although we remain cautious about the macro economic conditions in Europe and the EMA region, our businesses are continuing to estimate positive growth due to a number of favorable Sealed Air trends including enhanced opportunities among food and beverage processors; global accounts; and with distributors within the institutional and laundry segment. Our expanded market reach through new distribution channels that we've mentioned earlier, such as Staples and Synthos, and through business partner relationships like the one we have with GE Water & Process Technology. Also, we're relying an existing strong sales momentum in the developing regions where we continue to expand our penetration with a more robust share infrastructure. We look to the strength of our new products across all these business segments, which we have the opportunity to further scale on a global basis and expand Sealed Air's presence.", "And fourth, ongoing demand for protein in the developing regions of the world, as well as our processor customer demands for more efficient automated packaging solutions to lower their total cost. So although global meat production is expected to rise by only 1 to 2 percentage points in 2012, although actually declined by approximately 2 percentage points in the United States, we believe that automation, effective packaging and improved merchandising and convenience features on packaging, and a solid export market will continue to drive our sales going forward. Additionally, our global footprint positions us well for anticipated healthier Brazil and Australian markets in 2012, which will contribute growth to our food portfolio.  ", "On a more specific basis, our Food Packaging business is expecting to achieve constant dollar sales growth in 2012, very similar to 2011, with greater strength in areas like Latin America and Asia-Pacific, on more favorable comparisons and rebounding industries in those parts of the world. ", "Our Food Solutions business expects to achieve constant dollar growth rate above 2011 rates following the anniversary of the case raise switch [ph] by a major retailer, but also ongoing penetration among their growth programs in developing regions and our fluid-based packaging systems.", "Among our Industrial Packaging business, we are expecting similar constant dollar rates as seen in 2011 due to ongoing strong penetration, adoption of new products, new channel partnerships and product development opportunities with Diversey. Our Diversey segment is expecting to achieve a top line growth rate in line with our consolidated target, which will be driven by ongoing developing region growth, new channel partners, scaling certain product lines globally, and achieving sale synergies with the Sealed Air teams.", "The combination of mid single-digit constant dollar sales growth in 2012 with higher cost synergies contributed to -- is expected to contribute to a 2012 free cash flow estimate of approximately $450 million to $475 million, which we expect to allocate to our dividend payments, cash charges associated with restructuring and reducing our debt.  This morning, we targeted a year-end net debt reduction target of approximately $260 million in 2012, bringing our debt down to below $4.9 billion, a solid reduction towards our net debt reduction target of $4.5 billion by the end of 2013. ", "As we saw on the fourth quarter, our portfolio of businesses are rather defensive and resilient, but we do face risks. For 2012, we estimate our risk to be volatility in raw material inflation; achieving sufficient benefits from pricing actions to recover raw material costs; operational efficiency during the integration process; and further fiscal or geopolitical challenges in Europe and the EMA region. Overall though, we feel confident in the factors we can control and continue to monitor conditions with contingency plans, if conditions merit, for those factors that we cannot control.", "Lastly, I should note that our guidance range currently excludes the payment of the W.R. Grace settlement, as the exact timing of the settlement continues to be unknown. We have estimated that the payment of the settlement is expected to be accretive to adjusted EPS by approximately $0.13 per share annually following the payment date, under the assumption of using a substantial portion of our cash on hand to fund the payment.", "Before moving to the Q&A session, I recognize that a key point of interest has been our 2013 objectives, as outlined in our June 2011 presentations during the time of the launch of our Diversey acquisition and announcement. Most notably, the 2013 objectives were targeted at $9 billion in sales revenue and $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Although we're in the process of analyzing any necessary recalibration to these objectives, changes in the foreign currency exchange rates alone in the past 8 months would reduce the $9 billion goal to approximately $8.6 billion today, which we feel is achievable by the end of 2013. Our initial adjusted EBITDA goal of $1.6 billion would also be impacted in a similar way by foreign exchange translation but also by the accounting adjustments we have harmonized in Diversey's version of adjusted EBITDA to Sealed Air's definition. These 2 adjustments would suggest an estimated recalibration of the adjusted EBITDA objective to be now in the $1.45 billion range.", "And now, operator, I would now like to open the call for any questions from the participants and intermediately, we'll look through text questions from our webcast participants as well. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My 2 questions, Bill, Tod, is it possible at this juncture to broadly bracket the amount of cash outlay you expect around restructuring related to Diversey? And then the second question I had, guys, is as you look at how the year concluded and some of the risks, especially obviously, in Europe, how comfortable are you with the low end of your guidance and your ability, as you mentioned earlier, to bring in contingency plans to adjust if conditions warrant?", "Tod S. Christie", "George, this is Tod. I'll take the first question. So we recorded a $53 million charge for restructuring in the fourth quarter. We paid, in the quarter, $29 million of that so you can assume that the balance gets paid this year. And then we're also targeting additional payments this year as we record additional restructuring charges. So I would, just as kind of a broad estimate, I would say somewhere about $100 million this year in cash payments.", "William V. Hickey", "And George, go back to part 2 of your question or your second question. I'm still hopeful on Europe. I mean, we've been waiting for the Greek deal to happen any day, and any day is always tomorrow. But I've been to Europe twice now in the last 8 weeks. And there's a commitment on the part of the Europeans to pull this together. It's in everybody's interest to keep the euro whole, whether Greece stays in it or not. So I do think they will muddle their way through. And our contingency plans are basically to manage our cost and headcount very, very carefully.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So you remain comfortable then on the $1.40, even with Europe doing what it's doing?", "William V. Hickey", "I think we said $1.50.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Excuse me, $1.50. Pardon me.", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. I mean, there's always that macro risk. As I said in my comments, we're pretty comfortable with the risk we can control and the ones we can't, we'll watch carefully. And George, thanks for your comments on the mess. I mean, we're trying to feed all of you as much information as we can. So hopefully, we'll be able use it.", "Operator", "Your next question is Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just to clarify, Bill, the $4.50 to $4.75 free cash flow. That excludes any cash restructuring charges?", "William V. Hickey", "That's right, Ghansham, that's our usual free cash flow calculation. So if you take out the $100 million I just mentioned in my response to George, that's really what we're looking at as the starting point for paying dividends and paying down debt.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Got you. And just to sort of clarify and establish a baseline for '12 also. What was the pro forma EBITDA for both legacy Sealed and Diversey in '11?", "Tod S. Christie", "Got that. Yes. So you're looking for the pieces?", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes.", "William V. Hickey", "While Tod is getting the pieces too, here, together. Just let me go back to Tod's earlier comment. If you take that cash flow number, and I think we were looking at, Tod said about $100 million to pay cash restructuring costs and about another $100 million in dividends. So that's how you get to the debt repayment number.", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. I mean, the total on a pro forma basis for 2011 is sort of in the $1.60 billion, $1.70 billion range. The legacy Sealed Air is probably 70% of that.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And using all the -- I mean, it was great you guys gave us a lot parameters for '12. We get to about $1.16 billion at the midpoint. Does that seem reasonable for '12?", "Tod S. Christie", "I think that's probably a little on the low side.", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. Probably a little on the low side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "The synergy number that you guys provided, it's more than double what you initially planned. Just want get some thoughts, what are some of the puts and takes, I guess, more on the positive side? And does that number include some of these opportunities you guys have talked about in the past, in terms of SKU rationalization, supply chain optimization?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes, Phil, this is Tod. The initial targets that we put out there were based on what we knew in the early days. And now that we've had integration teams working on the opportunities and working together for several months, they've been able to uncover a number of additional opportunities. The initial guidance was based really just on SG&A and back-office type of costs. And as we've developed the model, we are now identifying cost in cost of goods, so things like supply chain optimization, which is new. So it's more in SG&A plus the addition of the manufacturing network.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "But some of the stuff you guys have highlighted in the past about Diversey, how they wanted to reduce their SKU and supply chain optimization. Is that separate or is that now included with that $100-plus million number?", "William V. Hickey", "No, Philip, I think we said it in the press release, I think we said that the integration optimization program does not include the individual programs that Diversey had prior to the transaction. So that was their EPC and their SKU rationalization. Those are still standalone, as they were, that we told you about back in the summer.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And that's what I thought. I just wanted to verify that. And then the European Principal program, how should we think about the optioning going forward? I mean, I think it's mostly coming from the tax line, but just wanted some thoughts now for 2013.", "William V. Hickey", "Right. It's mostly the tax line. It's mostly the tax line, and it's about $30 million. Wait, Tod has a...", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. We had talked about $30 million, probably back in the spring, and the project is still on target to go live in the second quarter of this year. So this year, we will be continuing to incur some costs to go live, which will begin to be offset by the benefits. That'll be a net cost this year, and that's contemplated in our guidance. For 2013, we're still expecting benefits but we expect them to be somewhat lower than we originally anticipated, in part because that $30 million number reflected an old euro to dollar exchange rate. And in part because European profitability is somewhat less than what it was back when we were talking about it in June.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So with kind of tax rate should we be thinking about for 2013, I mean, at this juncture?", "Tod S. Christie", "Overall company core tax rate should be 30% and trending lower over time as we're able to implement additional tax planning strategies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "You were giving some, Bill, some net debt numbers that, of course, include the W.R. Grace liability. But I believe, and just correct me, they do not though include the tax benefit that would come back to you once you make that payment.", "William V. Hickey", "Right. The net number we use, the $5.155 billion, is short-term debt, long-term debt, W.R. Grace settlement less cash. That's the $5.155 billion.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. So we should really think of the tax benefit coming back the other way is about $300 million, $400 million, right?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. That'll be a boost to cash flow when it happens.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Okay. And then the quick follow-up would be, you gave the adjusted cash EPS of $2.10 to $2.20. But just so I'm sure, if you also added in the impact of the interest you're incurring on the W.R. Grace monies that you don't pay out, then you would add $0.13 to that. In other words, that $2.10 to $2.20 does not include the $0.13 eventual benefit you get when W.R. Grace settled.", "Tod S. Christie", "No. We'll get the benefit in our conventional adjusted EPS. But the way the calculation works, because we add back non-cash interest in the adjusted cash EPS, so there's no bump to that number when we fund Grace.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.", "Got you. It's already in there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Bill, could you give us a feel, or Tod, on the order pattern on the Protective Packaging side during the quarter, and then since the end of the quarter? And linked to that, could you also give us a feel for how much you were helped by the strong e-commerce during the holidays?", "William V. Hickey", "I think I'll start with it and say that the trend for orders has been pretty consistent. I'll say Europe was a little softer at the end of the fourth quarter. But overall, Protective on a global basis was reasonably consistent and continuing into the first quarter, again, with continued -- a little bit, softness in Europe. The e-commerce was a real big boost in the fourth quarter. I would just, without mentioning the name of a large e-commerce company, but we were shipping 5 truckloads to them at one point just before the holidays.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And you have seen that, obviously, substantially declined at this particular stage, right?", "William V. Hickey", "Well, I call it seasonal. Rosemary, I guess I refer to -- if you look at our trends, just the seasonality of our business, the fourth quarter is 26% of the business and the first quarter is like 22%, 23%. So it's not really a decline, it's a seasonal adjustment.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay, so that was my first question. And could you give us a feel for what is in the capital expenditure level that you have given us for 2012?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes, Rosemary, the total is about 180 to 190. That includes about 20 related to the restructuring and integration programs. And the balance is kind of normal maintenance plus growth projects. So just kind of typical things that we see in our business all the time. The Diversey piece of that is relatively small because their business tends to have lower capital requirements than the legacy Sealed Air business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Bill, I think you gave us some color when you talked about these increased synergy targets and you talked about stuff in the Diversey side that you excluded from this. Do you do the same thing with the legacy Sealed Air? I mean, you have to have some ongoing sort of efficiency cost takeout programs on both sides of the business as just sort of an ongoing way to kind of tread water in a competitive market. Have you excluded that same kind of stuff on the Sealed Air side?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. What we basically have communicated to investors prior to the end of the fourth quarter in terms of programs that either Sealed Air was doing or Diversey was doing, those remained separate. In fact, within Sealed Air we've actually set up an IMO, an integration management office, which is going to be tracking -- in fact, it's already started, tracking the new integration and optimization program as a separate component from the existing cost-reduction and savings programs of the legacy companies.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And just as a follow-on, you talked about having a lot of joint sales teams out on the road. Have you had any significant wins at this point? If you couldn't identify the wins, could you give us like the size of any wins that you might have had?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. I think you heard me, but I probably said end of the fourth quarter. We've already closed, I think it was 4 or 5 accounts. It's less than $10 million so far. Well, actually, I feel pretty good about one we got yesterday. We got a water account through the GE partnership which we took in Latin America, which was really our first win on the water treatment side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions for you. First of all, when you reported the third quarter, you talked about an adjusted EBITDA number for the fourth quarter of $335 million to $345 million. And then today's number was lower than that. Is that an apples-to-apples comparison, what you reported today, relative to what you provided as your outlook for the fourth quarter when you had the third quarter call?", "William V. Hickey", "Tod's got the reconciliation, I'll let him handle that.", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. So Alex, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. And we broached that subject first when we filed our 8-K/A in December. So there were a couple of changes that we made on the Diversey side relative to dosing and dispensing equipment where we aligned their policy for accounting for that with ours, as well as the cash-settled SARS, or stock appreciation rights. So with that adjustment, that brought down the Diversey portion of the target. Staying on the Diversey side, there was some impact during the quarter from lower sales volumes. And we mentioned, in some of our prepared remarks, that the raw material inflation was higher than originally anticipated during the quarter. So those were the factors on the Sealed Air side. On the Diversey side -- I'm sorry, I got them flip-flopped -- on the Sealed Air side of the business, it was a combination of lower volumes and mix that led to slightly lower EBITDA for the quarter. And then the third element was the foreign exchange losses related to the Diversey transaction that were about $19 million in the quarter. So a combination of change in accounting definition, some lower volumes and higher costs and the onetime non-cash FX losses.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful, Tod. And the other question I had, on the restructuring cost, you've talked about $100 million in '12. Do you have a sense of what you expect those to run beyond 2012?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. The $100 million was our rough estimate of the cash out this year. And the total cost that we've identified is about $165 million to $185 million. So that's the P&L cost, of which $53 million we recorded in the fourth quarter. The bulk of the rest of it, we expect to record this year, and then there'll be some trailing cost beyond that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions for you. First, and Bill, I appreciate the color along the way. I'm just a little confused with one part. As I'm comparing your 10/21 to 11/31, so October, November where you were with kind of you finished the year. It would appear as though Food Solutions, Protective Packaging, Diversey, each must have fell off pretty sharply in December. In other words, Protective Packaging, you're up 6% through those first 2 to 3 months and then finished at 4%. Diversey, you were flat to up 1%, you were thinking. You finished down. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, was December appreciably different in some of those businesses? And then what is your assumption -- I'll let that be my second part, to get to an assumption as to how we move forward. So the business trajectory, December versus what you saw earlier in the quarter.", "William V. Hickey", "Right. I'm looking, if I look at the ones you mentioned, Food Solutions was plus 7%, then plus 4%, so it was down 3%. And if you look at it, really, North America, Europe were really plus 5% of those numbers. And they came in at plus 2%. So most of the shortfall in Food Solutions was North America and Europe, primarily in Europe, where I think we really saw the southern part of Europe drop off pretty well in terms of Food. Interestingly enough, I was talking to the head of one of the supermarket chains who has been in business for 28 years. He said it's the first time year-over-year there's been a decline in food sales, which is a really remarkable statistic in Europe, and most of that happened at the end of the year. The other is there wasn't a real holiday season. There wasn't a lot of enthusiasm in Europe coming December. And remember, we were still -- Europe was really -- particularly in the South, the Italians, the Spanish, the Greeks, and we even saw France. France is very likely in a recession or just tipped over into it. So Europe is pretty much the culprit for both Food Solutions and Protective in the month of December, at the end of the quarter.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess where I'm kind of thinking about this is I realize we get changes between -- as we're looking at a constant dollar and as we're looking at the price/mix component. But from Tod's earlier comments that you had recovered about 80% of the inflation components, I'm assuming that you'll get the other 20% next year. So if we take price/mix out of the equation, what does this imply? What have you embedded into your assumptions for these different businesses, for just a volume basis for 2012? So in other words, Food Packaging Solutions, Protective, Diversey. What are you anticipating your core volume levels to be for '12?", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. What we are assuming, in terms of the core volume levels for '12, I think what we said in my comments that I said earlier, reasonably in line with 2011 full-year actuals -- which overall is in the 2 percentage range in terms of volume, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "I guess the first question would be on Diversey, if you could quantify the price cost headwind in the fourth quarter. And it also sounds like it's a bit of a steeper headwind than you'd originally anticipated, and if you could give us detail around that, what you're seeing there,  and if you're caught up.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. I just do have just a -- just looking at Diversey's kind of fourth quarter is what you're looking at, Al? Are you looking at the full year?", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "I'm looking at the fourth quarter. It seems like there may have been a pretty decent size price cost headwind in the fourth quarter of '11. And I just wanted to see if you could quantify maybe what that was for us, one. And two, I think versus your earlier expectations, it sounds like this headwind, this price cost, is certainly worse than your initial expectations. And why is that? Is it tougher in terms of getting the pricing through? Is it the raw materials that are higher than you thought? And at this stage, are you caught up to it right now as you're in the first quarter?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, okay. Let me just say that the raw material cost in the fourth quarter in Diversey was up around $21 million. And if you look at the net of what they've been able to recover with the composite cost and mix, it ends up being about $13 million behind, exiting the fourth quarter. We really thought we'd be closer to catching up at the exit rate. It's a term the Diversey people use in terms of how they manage their price/mix. Their exit rate for the fourth quarter was planned to be 0. It actually came in at a minus 13. And I think that we will recover the 13. There are early signs of its coming back again in 2012. But if I look at Diversey's sort of overall top line performance for the fourth quarter, their sales were down about 1%. That represented kind of a volume impact of about minus 3 and a price impact of plus 2 -- plus 2.4, as it actually turned out to be. So there's recovery in price, but not enough to recover all of the cost. And a lot of their pricing is on a contract basis,  and so they really have to go through the contract price adjustments.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And I missed -- now so there's still a headwind the first quarter we should expect? I mean, when do you catch up to this?", "William V. Hickey", "Well, let's just say we are entering the first quarter $13 million behind. That's probably the best I can say right now.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then secondly, on the cost savings, the $50 million this year. Can you help us with the ramp there? What's the run rate that you've realize thus far? How does this ramp throughout the year? Is it linear? Is it back end-loaded?", "William V. Hickey", "Tod may have a good answer on that. But subject to Tod jumping in here, I think what our integration group has come up with, there's about $20 million already saved, so to speak. That'll run for at least 11 months. It's already achieved, based on what we did in the fourth quarter of last year. I'll let Tod comment further on that.", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. We have, as Bill said, about $20 million already done and locked down. The balance will, I would say -- there'll be more benefits in the latter part of the year as we are ramping up from 50 this year to 100 next year. So I think you'll see sequential improvement over the course of the year.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And there's not going to be any offsetting cost? So the $20 million run rate, we should see all of that in the first quarter? There's not any extra cost in realizing any of that, that's hitting, are there?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. I mean, there's some of the cost that we already recorded in the fourth quarter. And I expect we'll take additional charges this year. But no, it's not anything more than what's already been disclosed in the press release.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Gazerano [ph] from Miznix [ph].", "Unknown Analyst", "A couple of, I think, quick questions, the first being you provided -- for 2012, you provided percentages for cost of goods sold in SG&A. I just want to confirm that the restructuring charges that you've discussed are not included in those percentages.", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes, that's right. So if you look at the -- let me just go to that page. Yes, that's right. That's just our normal expected run rate on those charges.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then you spoke about a net debt target for 2013 of $4.5 billion. Does that include the Grace settlement, because you had mentioned that there should be some cash benefit. So if we look at the $4.5 billion, should we then assume that it's \"if\" and when the Grace settles, then it could potentially be lower?", "Tod S. Christie", "It actually doesn't have a really significant impact on the net debt target because we expect to use mostly cash to fund the settlement. And if you look at our balance sheet at the end of the year, we had $723 million of cash. And I believe the Grace liability, with the accrued interest, was something like $830 million. So there will be some incremental borrowing that we would need to do on a short-term basis to assist with the funding. And so to the extent that we increase borrowing to do that, then we would likewise decrease it with the proceeds from the cash tax benefits. So the $4.5 billion is a target that we have without the Grace settlement, and there might be some incremental benefit to that but it wouldn't be huge.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And then the last question is, you've just mentioned that Diversey is mostly a contractual business and that the pricing was up 2% in the fourth quarter. But as those contracts reprice, shall we expect declining prices throughout 2012?", "William V. Hickey", "No. We're looking at increasing prices in 2012.", "William V. Hickey", "Operator, let me take some of the text questions that have come before we go back around and take the second round from people on the phone. ", "First question that came in on the webcast was, \"Would you please give us the split between Europe, Mideast, Africa, between Diversey and legacy businesses?\" If I look at what we classify as EMA, about 55% of that business represents the legacy Diversey business -- 58% the legacy Diversey business; about 13% of it represents the core Sealed Air Protective Packaging business; and about 13% of it represents the core Food Packaging business; and 12% represents the core Food Solutions business; and there's about 4% Other, which is primarily our medical business. So I hope that was what you were looking for in terms of how the EMA mix splits up among the company. ", "The second question on the webcast, \"Tax refund expected in 2013 if W.R. Grace is settled this year. Still plan to use the proceeds to repay bonds that come due in 2013?\" If Grace is settled this year and Sealed Air makes the payment to the trust funds as required in the settlement agreement in 2012, we should expect to get the tax refund in 2013, in which case, we would use that to repay debt. I think that answers that question. ", "The third question is, \"Please detail charges, operating income and EBITDA for Diversey in Q4 and for 2012.\" I'll let Tod handle that part of it. I know he's got part of it right here in front of him. Tod?", "Tod S. Christie", "Yes. I'm just pulling out -- so Diversey EBITDA in the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, was in the sort of $65 million to $70 million range. And then the operating income would be slightly below that, taking out the P&A  [ph] . 2012, we haven't separately provided guidance for Diversey on either of those metrics.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. Can we go back, operator, and take a second round on the phone here?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from a follow-up of George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Bill, Tod, looking back over time, when Sealed Air has had the need to further increase its free cash flow, it has shown a pretty good ability to pull down capital spending fairly quickly. And we also have the context, I think you said earlier at one point, during 2011, that one of your goals was to, I think you said, \"Passionately pay down debt.\" And so I guess considering both of those points, if you agree with the premise of the prior one, what flexibility do you think you have to -- while achieving all your growth goals and objectives for Diversey and the business, perhaps pull down that capital spending from what you've already guided to. What's the flexibility you think you have there?", "William V. Hickey", "George, you know we're pretty capable of managing capital down. So that remains part of our contingency if we need to.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Would there be anything -- you mentioned there would be a contingency. If you could talk to it, what would perhaps not be spent behind from a capital standpoint? Well, I think [ph] you'd like to. If you needed to bring down the capital spending in 2012, what would be the first thing that perhaps might go?", "William V. Hickey", "I don't know, that's a tough call, George. There's no major investments in 2012. I say there is one. I think we mentioned to you last year, we acquired a new factory in Brazil, and building that out this year is part of that number. I mean, I think long-term interest of the business to build out that factory in Brazil is kind of the right thing to do. As a contingency, I'd probably continue forward with that project but cut back on some of the smaller ones.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. The other question I had and I'll turn it over. We can pretty much back into your EBITDA guidance this year based on the guidance you gave overall for the business, and you provided earlier a debt pay-down target for us. Should we assume that these are the targets that you will see incentive compensation for the organization based around? Or could the targets vary from what we've seen provided in the release and results today?", "William V. Hickey", "Well, yes. I mean, George, one, I can't speak for the board, who has that on their agenda to address. But I can pretty confidently say it won't be any less than those.", "Operator", "You also have a follow-up question from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Bill, could you touch on the mix shift in Food Packaging? If you exclude the business that you had lost last year, and which I guess we have now anniversary-ed, is that a permanent shift outside of that particular item or do you think that, as the economy picks up, customers will go back to higher-margin, higher-price products?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. I think, Rosemary, one of the shifts is the equipment side of our business was up quite a bit in 2011, which is always a good sign, especially in a challenging economy if customers are willing to invest in equipment. So our equipment sales are up. Our equipment sales are at very modest margins because we want to get the razor in the customers' hands so they can use the razor blades. So the equipment sales being up is an unfavorable mix for profitability, but does bode well for future sales. On the other side, some of the shrink bag sales are down, they're down a little bit. And that's due to some changes in customer use as well as an absolute decline in the number of animals processed. I think I commented earlier that meat production in the United States is down 1.1% for the full year 2011. So that's a factor. So you've got equipment going up at a lower margin and shrink bag sales going down at a higher margin.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay, that is helpful. And if I may, could you give us a better feel for what those 2 small acquisitions are that you mentioned?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. One was an automated packaging machine for meat. And the other one was a small medical one where we actually put a small medical plant in Costa Rica, to take advantage of a lot of our medical customers who have moved operations down there. And it's much more efficient and cost effective to serve them locally than to ship product down from the U.S.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Do you see that medical business really growing going forward?", "William V. Hickey", "It's growing slowly, but it's growing.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "You're planning on keeping it?", "William V. Hickey", "We haven't made that decision yet. Haven't made any of those decisions yet, Rosemary.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. That would imply to the entire Other category unless something is about to kind of fly out the door?", "William V. Hickey", "Okay. All I can say is stay tuned. Well, we've got 3 questions up there, operator. Let's take those 3 and be done. So would you take the next one?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess I wanted to understand as well. I'm looking at your integration optimization update. So it looks like you had an extra $60 million to $75 million that you are anticipating in that '12, '13, '14 timeframe -- or mostly '13, '14 timeframe. When I look at the cost associated with that, the $165 million to $185 million for charges, and then incremental $40 million to $54 million for CapEx, I'm assuming that, on the restructuring side, those will all be cash charges?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. They'll be substantially cash charges. Most of it is employee severance, and depending on the part of the world you're in, employee severance in Europe tends to be quite high and the U.S. tends to be more modest. So it ends up being an average of about 1.5-year payback.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Well, I guess where I'm going with this is, if I add these, and I think about the savings and I think about the total cost including the CapEx -- and I kind of get to that, if you have $60 million to $75 million of savings and the total op being in the low 2s that this is kind of 3- to 4-year payback for the whole project. Am I thinking about that the right way?", "Tod S. Christie", "I'm not sure you're picking up all the savings, because we\u2019re looking at total savings annualized by the end of the program of $110 million to $115 million.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I apologize, Tod. I was considering this is incremental, right? So the incremental part, the CapEx and the new charges associated, just attaching that to the incremental part. Is that maybe an incorrect assumption?", "Tod S. Christie", "Well, there were charges associated with the first $50 million that we identified as well. So now it's all bundled together. So total program, $110 million to $115 million in benefits; $165 million to $185 million of P&L charges; and another $40 million to $50 million of CapEx.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I apologize, I was assuming that all of the new integration and optimization program was -- I was just assuming an increment fund [ph]. Okay, that's helpful.", "Operator", "And another follow-up question from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Just on the sales force of legacy Sealed Air and Diversey. I just wanted to get your thoughts on integration, if you keep them separate, how you're thinking about that?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. But you remind me of something about which I did want to say, is that although we're going through this integration optimization process, we're not reducing the number of salespeople. We're actually putting additional salespeople in the field. And we will actually have -- I think you saw our earlier announcement, we'll have basically 3 sales forces. I mean, because we'll have 3 businesses, the core Protective Packaging business, which we organize now was as a business within Sealed Air. They will continue to call on the industrial packaging customers. You will have the legacy Diversey, excluding the food and beverage piece of it. They will call on the hotel, hospitality, lodging chains. They will still do that as they had before. The integration really comes in the food side, on the food and beverage component, where we're combining the Sealed Air food sales and technical service people with the Diversey food and beverage sales and service. That integration has occurred. They've had joint training. They've been cross-trained on each other's products. There's a couple of meetings coming up the next couple of weeks and they will call on customers collectively.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And how has been the initial customer feedback on this?", "William V. Hickey", "Well, I said, as Amanda said earlier, with only a couple of months behind us, we've got probably sales under $10 million, 4 or 5 accounts and a fair number in the pipeline.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "On the one hand, if we look at the December trajectory, would it be fair to assume that thus far, first quarter volumes are negative or, at best, flat? And is that embedded in your guidance? And then the second question, Bill, bigger picture. Over the last month or so, there had been a couple of people added your board who bring a great amount of experience and very good background. How do you see them being helpful to Sealed Air and its development over the next couple of years?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. Okay, let me say that our January numbers are slightly up. I would say slightly up, it's been a slower start to the year, which you would expect after December. But again, the first quarter tends to be our slowest quarter. And as far as our new directors, I mean, they're real quality people, good experience. One from a general industrial background and the other with specific knowledge of the packaging industry, have got good experience, good credentials and I think will be an asset to the Sealed Air board. So I look forward to working with them.", "Okay. With that operator, that's all the time we have, and I'd like to thank everyone for your participation in the call. I'd like to extend my thanks to the customers, employees, shareholders, and partners for helping us through a challenging but very exciting year, which ultimately transformed our organization with the addition of Diversey. I'm really proud of the hard work and achievements of our team in a very, very short period of time, our ability to stay focused on our customers\u2019 needs and the exciting opportunities ahead. I believe our combined efforts will result in ongoing and continuous improvements, stronger cash flows, further reduction in debt, all of which will enhance our earnings and shareholder value. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Sealed Air conference call discussing the company's third quarter 2012 results. This call is being recorded. Leading the call today we have William V. Hickey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions]", "And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.", "Amanda H. Butler", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we've provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast, as well it can also be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. And we encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release, which are provided with this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find also on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we've included in our earnings release. Lastly, we have used pro forma results for certain metrics in the quarter to aid in the comparison of our performance to historical combining metrics of Sealed Air and Diversey. These pro forma results are available as supplements on our website.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey. Bill?", "William V. Hickey", "Thank you, Amanda, and good morning to everyone. Before we begin our discussion on the quarter, I would like to really thank everyone for their flexibility in participating in our call today, which as you know, is outside of our normally scheduled date and time. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy and the aftermath that has disrupted a lot of people around the New York metro area, we felt it was prudent to delay the release and earnings call for everyone's safety.", "Additionally, it is with great pleasure that I welcome and introduce Jerome Peribere, as Sealed Air's new President and Chief Operating Officer. As we previously announced, Jerome will succeed me as Sealed Air's Chief Executive Officer in March of next year. Jerome brings to us a wealth of international experience gained from 35 years at the Dow Chemical Company. He has significant global experience, which is particularly important to Sealed Air today, where we have 60-plus percent of our business outside the United States.", "Interesting, he also brings packaging experience as his first job at Dow Chemical in France was selling Ethafoam polyethylene foam, which is one of the products that we still sell today. And most importantly, he brings recent acquisition-integration experience from Dow's Rohm and Haas acquisition where he led the integration of Rohm and Haas into the Dow Chemical Company. Jerome has been a quick understudy and in his first 2 months, he has met our key managers, met with employees on 3 continents and met with numerous customers of our food, protective and Diversey businesses. He's off to a great start.", "On today's call, I will give a few opening comments, then Jerome will highlight our business unit performance. Carol Lowe, our CFO, will follow with a more detailed discussion on our consolidated results, liquidity, other key matters outlined in our press release as well as our updated guidance.", "Following our prepared remarks, we will provide time for your questions. I plan to have Jerome and Carol address your questions. But of course, I will be available as needed. As a reminder, all of our results outlined here today reflect the announced sale of Diversey Japan and its classification as a discontinued operation.", "Getting started on Slide 2 of our presentation. The third quarter paced well with our assumptions and guidance for the second half of the year, despite uneven recovery in our end markets and a fair amount of caution expressed by our consumers and our customers during the quarter. We stayed focused on the goals we established at the beginning of this year: integrating Diversey; generating our synergies; and accelerating our growth programs to increase market presence, EBITDA and free cash flow. We did a solid job in the third quarter, which I will dive into a bit more in the next slide.", "We improved our profitability performance significantly over the second quarter, giving us good momentum going into the fourth quarter. I do want to point out that our Food Packaging business operating margin recovered in the third quarter and improved 390 basis points by restarting up our production at our new plant in Brazil. As we indicated earlier, during the second quarter, we shut down one of the production lines in Brazil to move it to our new facility, 120 kilometers away. As a result of higher-than-projected customer demand, we had to import products from the U.S. at a high freight and duty cost to continue to supply customers.", "I am pleased to tell you that last week when Jerome and I were in Brazil, I saw the production line installed and running salable product. Imports have stopped, and you can see the effect in our third quarter operating results.", "Additionally, early this week, we announced the sale of Diversey Japan, an asset that was identified as part of our strategic review, and we expect to close that transaction in the fourth quarter. We plan to use the net proceeds to prepay debt, which will enable us to exceed our 2012 net debt goal of $4.95 billion.", "Strategically this allows us to invest in higher growth areas such as Asia and Latin America, where we're making strong inroads with Diversey constant dollar sales growth rates in those 2 areas at 13% and 9%, respectively.", "Let's move to Slide 3. You will see a snapshot of our consolidated trends. And you can see how we've achieved good year-over-year and sequential momentum across a number of key metrics, including sales, profitability, margins and synergies. We continue to make strong inroads toward meeting our strategic objectives: achieving net sales gains through [indiscernible] graphic expansion, achieving sales gains through ongoing and adoption of our new inventive solutions, sales gains through incremental $10 million of annualized synergy sales and sales gains through new customer wins around the world. Our profitability metrics improved on greater operational execution, lower raw material cost, increasing cost, synergy benefits and seasonality.", "If I move to Slide 4, although Jerome and Carol will provide more detail into the components of these results, I will highlight the growth we have achieved leveraging our extensive 62-country footprint, which continues to give us leading reach and greater opportunity for international growth than our peers.", "Looking at the map on this Slide 4, you can see that we maintained or grew our organic growth rates in the third quarter compared with trending in the second quarter, largely led by unit volume growth in Food and Protective Packaging business and through solid price generation in our Diversey segment.", "North America was the only exception, with a modest decline to steady year-over-year performance due to lower price/mix in Protective Packaging. This lower price/mix resulted from products mix shifts to more sustainable but more profitable film structures, which yielded improved margins for this segment. Of course, the key drivers of our momentum in the quarter came through solid execution among our businesses, which Jerome will now highlight. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. It's really great to be here with you today. As Bill mentioned, I'd like to start by discussing some of the key drivers we saw over the quarter and highlight a few areas I'm most excited about as I took the future of Sealed Air -- as I look at the future of Sealed Air.", "Turning to Slide 5 first. The key takeaway for Food Packaging is that the business is back on track. This is most evidenced by how we reestablished our third quarter adjusted operating profit margin back to 13.6%. This compares to the 9.7% margin we reported in the second quarter.", "So let's look first at the left side of the slide, and you'll see that a component of that margin improvement was volume growth. Food Packaging did a solid job, driving 2% volume growth in the quarter versus last year, with volumes up across all regions. Our growth was led by an 8% volume increase in Latin America, where our established footprint and strong market presence in Brazil allows us to benefit from the rising beef production rate in that country.", "Additionally, we saw 2% higher volume in Europe, Middle East, Africa on the strength of new customer wins in the Middle East, strength in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as benefits from mix shifts in Western Europe that favors Food Packaging segment products. These areas of strength offset the weak North American protein industry, which continued to face supply constraints in the quarter, with weighted average industry production rate down 2% versus last year.", "So I'm pleased to report that we try to evolve industry production rates. Generating this slight increase in volumes in North America, primarily from new customer wins and customer adoptions of new solution, like our Cryovac Multi-Seal FoldLOK reclosable package for retailized shredded cheese pack. This new solution has just rolled out and -- by a new specialty grocery retailer in the quarter and has triggered a second phase of development with a sponsor in cheese processor.", "Innovation and new solutions are at the core of our competitive advantage and remain the key factor in our ability to face above-industry production rate, this is especially the case in Food Packaging, where 25% of our sales come from new solutions.", "Looking now to the right of the Slide to profitability. Food Packaging margins were generally resilient year-over-year, but improved almost 400 points basis sequentially as we eliminated the unusual one item -- onetime item that we identified in the second quarter, and Bill mentioned -- made some comments a few minutes ago about that. And we significantly reduced our start-up cost in North America and Brazil related to facility consolidations, as he also did mention.", "In Brazil, we accelerated this relocation, and we achieved altogether this move a few months ahead of schedule, which will benefit fourth quarter margin results.", "Let's look at Food Solutions on Slide 6 now. Although many of our customers, especially in Europe and North America, are dealing with constrained protein supplies and price-sensitive consumers at retail, Food Solutions achieved 2% volume growth in the quarter, which outpaces protein industry production rate. Our volume performance was largely driven, in fact, by a 21% volume increase in our vertical pouch packaging solutions for fluid and semi-fluid product in North America, due to a record tomato crop this year and the right solutions to capitalize on these favorable trends.", "And last but not least, I'd like to highlight which is the 10% increase in volumes in Latin America due to the strength of local protein production, as well as new customer wins. This solid volume performance, combined with our lower raw material cost and solid management of expenses, yielded a very strong 12.8% adjusted operating profit margin, which is up 170 basis points versus last year.", "And now looking to the Protective Packaging segment on Slide 11. As you can see on the left of the slide, Protective is doing a good job at holding on its 0.4% volume growth rate, consistent with the second quarter trend. We achieved this despite a softening in the rate of global economic and ongoing weakness in Southern Europe and in China's export sector. A key area of growth for the business was the 20%-plus global volume increase in e-commerce and fulfillment-oriented applications that we issued globally. This strong growth rate reflects both the rising usage of e-commerce as well as customer wins in this sector. Additionally, Protective achieved a 2% volume growth in North America, reflecting modest growth in the industrial sector, as well as new customer wins in the region.", "Europe, Middle East and Africa remains the weakest region for Protective, with 2% lower volume, largely offsetting some persistent weakness in Southern Europe as customers continue to reduce their production volumes. And despite the modest volume improvement overall and the lower price/mix in the quarter, adjusted operating margin performance improved year-over-year and on a sequential basis, which you can see to the right of this slide, which reflects tight control of expenses and the benefit of our most sustainable film structures, which record less resin contents.", "And finally, to the Diversey segment on Slide 8. Looking to the left of the slide, on a pro forma basis, this segment generated 2% higher organic sales from 2% higher price/mix and a modest 0.5% decline in volumes. This volume performance is considerably improved compared to the negative 3% to 4% rate noted in prior quarters.", "The key drivers for this improvement are 7% higher volume in developing regions, the apparent stabilization of demand in Northern Europe, which has 70% of Diversey's European mix revenue, net gains in new customers and the ongoing expansion adoption -- and adoption of best-in-class solutions, like our TASKI floor care equipment systems among new and existing customers.", "As you can see by our slide, 2/3 of Diversey's revenue increased on a year-over-year basis with food and beverage, distributors and lodging achieving over 4% organic growth. The areas of greatest weakness continued to persist in the same sector noted in prior quarters due to lower reorder rate or cautious allocation of capital investment in equipments due -- in equipment systems due to the economy. The key area of weakness unique to Diversey is the consumer brands business, which accounts for approximately 1/4 of the year-to-year sales decline.", "So overall, we are demonstrating resilience in making good progress -- and making good progress in expanding our market presence. Innovation remains at the core of our growth strategy and there is a real momentum here.", "At the recent ISSA/INTERCLEAN conference in North America, which was 2 weeks ago in Chicago, the team launched Crystal Shield which is an innovating floor care system that combines a diamond abrasion and coating technology that offers more durability and requires less maintenance in a much improved sustainable way.", "Additionally, the team continues to expand the launch of Suma Combi, which is a combined detergent and rinse base for mechanical wear -- washing that can clean, rinse and dry, now replacing what took 3 different products before. This makes your version easier, faster and more sustainable for commercial kitchen uses.", "And additionally, we're poised for more system launches in the fourth quarter. All of these innovations will drive enhanced growth in 2013.", "And now looking to the right of this slide -- right side of this slide, profitability in the Diversey segment declined 17% on a reported basis against a challenging prior year comparison as the 2011 profitability benefited from $10 million of reversed bonus accruals. We, additionally, have an unfavorable foreign exchange effect this year -- this quarter. But on a constant dollar basis and excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange effect and the benefit of the lower bonus payments in 2011 and looking at the business on an apples-to-apples operational basis, profitability, in fact, rose a solid 42%.", "And as you can see, by the operating profit bridge on this slide, the only real unfavorable year-on-year impact is our investment in headcount in high-growth regions, which is yielding strong top line growth in developing regions and is expanding our presence in targeted areas in North America. We expect these investments to become accretive within 12 to 18 months.", "And now we will turn to Carol -- the call over to Carol, our CFO, to discuss third quarter financial results in more detail and highlight our outlook for the balance of the year.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. Following along with your presentation, Slide 9 highlights our integration and optimization program.", "Q3 benefited from $29 million in cost synergy, a $6 million increase over quarter 2. Our year-to-date cost synergies total $67 million. Our full year 2012 benefit is now estimated at $97 million, $7 million higher than previously expected, due to timing of benefits.", "I should note that in addition, our cash costs for 2012 have declined $20 million to $105 million. We have moved this cash cost savings into 2013, and we'll continue to update you in future quarters on the amount and anticipated timing of our spending. We continue to hold the total program benefit at an estimated $195 million to $200 million through 2014 and total cash cost at $235 million over the life of the program.", "Slide 10 summarizes our consolidated and adjusted EBITDA performance on both a pro forma and constant dollar basis. Year-over-year, constant dollar adjusted EBITDA accrued 2% on cost synergies and a favorable price cost spread of $18 million, with Food Packaging representing more than 1/3 of the favorable spread. These impacts were partially offset by the resource investments in high-growth developing regions that Jerome just mentioned, as well as some unfavorable mix.", "While the year-over-year increase is meaningful in light of the economic headwinds we continue to face, the real improvement story is the 19% improvement in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.3% for Q3 improved from 11.4% in Q2 on seasonality, cost synergies, price cost spread, elimination of onetime items and reduction of other charges that negatively impacted Q2, as both Bill and Jerome have highlighted so far in their comments.", "To bridge from the 2011 pro forma adjusted EBITDA including the effect of currency, you need to first revise the 2011 amount down from the $281 million to $271 million to reflect the benefit of the bonus and other compensation reductions previously mentioned that were recorded by Diversey in 2011.", "Now if you bridge from the $271 million, you add the $29 million in cost synergies and $18 million positive price cost spread. These benefits were offset by negative currency of $14 million, approximately $17 million in mix and under absorption and $15 million higher SG&A, again, on the increased resources to support growth in the developing regions.", "Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $28 million and $139 million year-to-date. Changes in working capital items for Q3 resulted in a net use of $75 million in the quarter. The increase in receivables of $58 million is largely due to an increase in exchange rates used to value quarter end receivable.", "For example, the euro was approximately $1.26 at the end of June versus $1.29 at the end of September. Also the seasonality of our Diversey institutional and laundry business impacted receivables balance as Diversey's Q3 sales are seasonally higher than Q2. And the payment terms for the Diversey institutional and laundry customers is slightly longer than our other businesses.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $541 million at September 30, which is an increase of $37 million from the balance at June 30. During Q3, we paid $121 million of interest, which is more than 1/3 of the total $320 million that we anticipate paying during the year.", "Cash payments in the quarter also included $23 million for income taxes, $30 million in 2013 term loan payments, $18 million related to our integration and optimization program and $25 million for our quarterly dividend.", "Turning to Slide 12. As of September 30, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.4 billion and our net debt was $5.26 billion. Our net debt at year end is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion. The estimated $500 million reduction from Q3 net debt balance will be funded by free cash flow plus approximately $300 million in proceeds from the sale of Diversey Japan. Achieving the $4.8 billion and net debt exceeds our stated goal of $4.95 billion by year end. We were also well within our covenant compliance at the end of Q3.", "As noted in our earnings release this morning, the company has recorded a noncash pretax charge of $1.2 billion for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. The impairment on Diversey's segment resulted from lower growth rate and margin performance than anticipated a year ago, with the lower performance significantly impacted by negative macroeconomic conditions and primarily in Europe. The goodwill impairment is subject to finalization as we complete step 2 of the analysis during the fourth quarter.", "Slide 13 notes our full year 2012 updated outlook that reflects the effect of discontinued operations from our Diversey Japan transaction, as well as the implied fourth quarter estimates for our 4 key guidance metrics. We expect reported or actual net sales of $7.7 billion with our business segment continuing to demonstrate sequential and year-over-year top line growth from seasonality and new customer wins; adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $995 million to $1.01 billion; adjusted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $1; and free cash flow of $375 million to $400 million. Our free cash flow estimate reflects traditionally high seasonal contribution in the fourth quarter from inventory reductions.", "During Q4, we expect to complete the sale of Diversey Japan, finalize our impairment analysis and move our financial reporting to reflect our new operating segments. For Q4 in the full year 2012 reporting, our new segmentation will include Food and Beverage, Institutional and Laundry, Protective Packaging and Other, which is mainly comprised of our medical applications business.", "And now I'll turn the call back to Bill to lead the Q&A session.", "William V. Hickey", "Okay, thank you. Thank you, Carol, and thank you, Jerome. As I indicated earlier, as your questions come in, I'll ask Carol and Jerome to field them. And of course, based on historical knowledge, I'm here to help the 2 of them.", "So operator, can we open up the call to any questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just on Diversey Japan, it seemed like a very, very profitable business compared to the rest of Diversey and it seems like a pretty strong franchise just judging by the margins. Can you take us through the logic of selling this business versus any other part of the portfolio, perhaps on the legacy Sealed Air side?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes, sure. And this is the first one, I think we said we're reviewing our portfolio of both Sealed Air, legacy Sealed Air and legacy Diversey. The Japan situation is -- it is a profitable business. It's the #1 franchise in Japan. But we looked at it as a very slow growth business. The Japanese economy, although strong, continues to have very, very slow growth. We have a leading market share, so we see very little opportunity to gain additional growth through share gains, as well as the Japanese economy, which we expect to continue to be -- Ghansham, we did a forecast out for Japan that discounted cash flow and looked at it and said, if someone is willing to give us that value today or higher, it makes sense. And it was -- and actually it had been run pretty autonomously from the Diversey business. It had its own separate product offering for the Japanese market. It had a number of products that were not consistent with our global portfolio. And when you looked at it, all considered, if we could monetize the discounted cash flow, it made sense to do it.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then perhaps a question for Jerome. Jerome, you're inheriting some very, very strong franchises but also some very big challenges, particularly the financial leverage at Sealed Air. Can you sort of outline some early thoughts on how you see the strategy at Sealed Air evolving under your leadership?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Ghansham, for the question. Now as I arrived 2 months ago, I have, by definition, traveled around the world, sometimes with Bill, sometimes without, and there are some very key highlights that I want to take out at this point in time. 2012 has been a year of transition very, very clearly. In my previous life, I had led the integration of the largest acquisition that Dow ever had made. And in reality, the word, \"Who moved my cheese?\" has to be present in everybody's mind because you have a lot of employees who have been unsettled by this kind of acquisition -- by any kind of acquisition. My approach is that I want to rally employees around our project, and our project is a growth project, is a growth project leveraging the equipment and the products we have into solutions, which are absolutely unique. And the commonality between the Diversey business that we have and the Sealed Air 2 business units that we have is that we have equipment which complements products when they're with solutions. It is very true in our Diversey industrial and laundry business, for example, we have all kinds of machinery and equipment like the TASKI machines themselves which make us the global leader in floor polishing [ph] and this kind of things. And you -- when you look at our Cryovac business, it is the same. When you look at our product packaging business, it is the same. So that's one commonality. The second thing is that I want to accelerate the new Sealed Air into -- and put our investment where population needs more packaged foods, more consumer -- or where consumers consume more proteins, where there is a need for more food safety and sanitization and hospitality improvements and where product production needs to be packaged in higher quality. So it really tells you where we are going to be investing. And actually, if there is one thing which has been surprising me at -- already is the amount of technology that we have in the pipeline. So that's where I'm going to be focusing my attention into.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner at Barclays.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can you just talk a little bit about the trends in Food Packaging throughout the quarter? I think you had a slide out there, middle of the quarter talking about July up 6% to 7%, maybe it was 5% to 6%. But looks like Food Packaging came in at plus 2% organic and Food Solutions plus 1%. Can you just sort of walk us through what sort of happened then during the quarter?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Scott, just one thing before -- and then Jerome will follow on with the trend, but what you're looking at was Food Packaging and Food Solutions together. Whereas for our quarterly, we -- it is broken apart. I just wanted to highlight that for you.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Okay, so what have we observed in Food Packaging? First of all is that when you exclude currency, our sales have been going up 2% and our operating income has been going up slightly less than 1%. We had, in fact, an unfavorable geographical mix. But we have some very interesting things happening. We had volume increase overall 2%, with 8% volume growth in Latin America, double-digit growth in Asia and a stable North America, with a negative product mix there. But we have also growth in Europe. That is for our Food Packaging business. Sequentially, we had suffered from quarter -- Q1 also in the second quarter, so no surprise that we're back on track with our kind of historical profitability in that segment. On Food Solutions, we've been doing quite well and we had our volume grow in North America by over 7% or almost 8%; Latin America, double digit; Europe, slightly negative; but Asia, Middle East, Turkey has been growing 20%. So how did that happen? Let me remind you that the Food Packaging is our traditional protein industrial packaging and our Food Solution is mostly [indiscernible] ready, our fluid high-barrier voucher that were microwavable type of products, so more consumer-driven. In North America, we have benefited from a very good growth in our pouches business for an exceptionally -- added by an exceptionally favorable tomato crop. But this is a very good new solution, which is a very strong alternative with lots of customer benefits versus can and for tomato, for example. So that's a very good type of new growth, which has been accelerated by a good agriculture tomato crop. But it's just a solution which is imposing itself. In Latin America, we try -- we're taking pricing actions in Brazil and in Argentina. The only negative spot is in Australia and New Zealand. Actually in Australia where we had a lot of rigid turbo foaming tubs [ph] and we lost to it on price also against competition. So generally speaking, this Food Packaging sector is starting to -- is somewhat tied to what's going on in the meat market. And again, we'd go on and talk about red fresh meat versus poultry and versus pork, but also we have innovation in different sectors, and this goes to a 50 [ph] type of products, which we are working strongly on, freshness, case-ready, multiple bags. The new consumer benefit packaging, which is our FoldLOK, as I mentioned earlier in -- as it were, specialty retail, which is actually pretty successful, and high-powered protein. So I think that this is going well. And what I'd like to mention is that our people internally are now working by leveraging this food packaging presence with our hygiene solutions where we have growth synergies and we're starting to see some benefits there of the former Diversey business in sanitation.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. I appreciate all the color. So did growth actually slow in the quarter though, on the combined businesses?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "I didn't hear you well.", "Carol P. Lowe", "First, where we reported -- at the conference slide that you're referring to for the combined businesses, we were reporting kind of year-over-year on an average daily sales basis, and they weren't quite as strong through the balance 2 months versus August.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Yes. Having said that, there's something, which is interesting. If you look at the Q3 volume, in Food Packaging and Food Solutions versus the year-to-date volume, the pace is accelerating. The Q3 volume in Food Packaging has been 2%. The Q3 volume in Food Solutions has been 2.3%. And when you look at the year-to-date, with just likely 1% on Food Packaging and just likely around 0.5% in the Food Solutions. So when I look at Q3 volume compared to the year-to-date, I'm seeing a positive trend there.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.", "", "The next question comes from the line of George Staphos at Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess I had 2 -- actually 3 questions, I'll try to make it brief. First of all -- and I joined the call late, so I apologize. First of all, there were a number of operating issues within Food Packaging back in the last quarter. Do you feel comfortable that you are on the path to resolving those by the end of the year, which is what I remember being the last [indiscernible]", "Carol P. Lowe", "George, I'll go ahead and respond to that and Bill can add a little bit of color because he was recently in Brazil, which is where a lot of the operating issues were highlighted for Q2. But yes, we feel like definitely the onetime items were onetime. And we have seen significant operational improvement, which is noted in the operating -- the adjusted operating margin for the Food Packaging. So I'll let Bill -- he can comment specifically with the bag line and what he saw in Brazil.", "William V. Hickey", "George, I think as we mentioned, one of the big items in Q2 was we moved the production line from our downtown S\u00e3o Paulo plant out to our new plant, which is about 120 kilometers away, which has a lower cost structure and more room for expansion. And we took down one of our major extrusion lines and we believe we've built up enough inventory because we've tried to pick a slow time of the year. Customer demand just picked up. That line was down. I think as we mentioned on Q2, we had to bring in products from the U.S., freight and duty. That line has moved. As I said earlier, Jerome and I were in Brazil last week. I actually said I wanted to see this line operating. It's up. It's installed in the new plant. It's producing product at a lower cost. And we put the 390 basis points back on the Food Packaging operating margin. We're not completely moved. There will be a Phase 2 sometime either early next year with the ultimate goal of moving the second and third extrusion lines out. But right now, we're back on track.", "Carol P. Lowe", "And, George, we would expect our exit rate out of Q4 for Food Packaging to be around 13% margin as opposed to the 12% that we discussed in our Q2 call.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. Let me ask one more question because I remember you typically have a 2-question limit, and this is a bigger picture question. I realize maybe a bit more difficult to answer. But this quarter, you took a $1.2 billion goodwill impairment for Diversey. You have to do what you have to do. That's on top of what's been $100 million or so of restructuring charges for the business this year. So one could argue that in terms of the relative level of investment, perhaps the value of -- ascribed to Diversey initially was maybe $1.3 billion too high. And as you look back at Diversey, where do you think the miscalibration, if you'd agree with that, came from? And did it -- has that anything to do with, perhaps?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. No, George, I wouldn't call it a [indiscernible] in time. I mean, if you remember the numbers we were looking at 18 months ago when we went through the acquisition analysis, the euro was in the high $1.40s. That filters to the earnings model, into the valuation. And also the European economy until March of '11 was holding up reasonably well. So we were looking at one, continued growth; and two, bringing those euros back to dollars at $1.48. I think when we updated our model that the accountants require us to do once a year, is you now take a lower earnings stream and you reduce the currency effect and you end up with a different value than you did a year ago. That's not an out-of-line situation. And I would venture to say that 2 years from now, you come up with a different number, it's -- probably be higher, but the accountants won't let you put it back.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Well, we look forward to that, but what you're saying is it's more the market, not the actual underlying performance or as it was presented to you?", "William V. Hickey", "Right, we do say -- I mean, the performance is less than our initial analysis showed 18 months ago, but they've been primarily from factors outside the business.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "You see, let me add a little bit of flavor there. You can imagine that I'm spending a lot of time looking at this part of the business. And when you look at the overall numbers for Europe in the first quarter, they are not very impressive. Having said that, you need to remember that we have some components of the business, which are equipment driven. And what we have observed for our company in Europe -- in Southern Europe is that our equipment sales are dramatically low. Well, who in Italy, in Spain or in Portugal today would be buying equipment? So that shop segment has suffered to a certain extent. Another segment, which has suffered is a little bit in our retail brands of business, generally speaking. And that's one other thing. When I -- what is important to me to see are we retreating in the core of our businesses in chemicals in various countries, et cetera, et cetera? And actually, I am quite pleased with the fact that we are starting to see a few very interesting things coming up. I'm pleased to see that our French business is doing quite well or is not retreating. I am pleased to see that our East European business is growing double digits. I'm pleased to see that our Asian business and our Latin American business is going double digits. And this is not only on the quarter but it is year-to-date. So you take our Chinese business, which has been growing 22% in this quarter and year-to-date, very nice additional number. So what is important to me is, where are the pockets of softness? And when I look at this quarter, for example, for the European Union business, more than 80% of our negative growth is coming from, guess where, Italy, Portugal and Spain. So am I pleased that this is -- that we're retreating? Absolutely not. But I can understand that this is not market share losses and on the contrary versus what is the local situation, fairly negative.", "Operator", "It comes from Rosemarie Morbelli at Gabelli.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Could you give us a little more detail on the Diversey business both in Europe and North America? I mean, you have focus on a couple of areas. But if you look at Diversey overall, do you see any changes in market trends, in your market share? Do you have and could you give us some -- an update actually on the progress on the F&B category?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Okay. Well, you've got F&B and then you've got our I&L or Diversey in general. I just talked quite a lot about it. We are growing faster than competition in where we really are seeing the future of our business. And that is extremely reassuring to me. When I see that we're growing double digit in Turkey, I'm pleased. When I see that we're growing in South Asia double digits, I'm pleased. When I'm seeing that Hong Kong -- that in India we're growing over 15%, and I'm not talking necessarily only in the quarter but also year-to-date. I'm saying that in the areas where there's a very deep crisis, we are coming down. When there is a very specific investment issue, equipment I just mentioned, we're coming down. Where there is potential for growth, we are flagging [ph]. On our North European business, it has had troughs and it is stable. On -- the good -- I'm going to give you just one country, which is Greece, where you would expect that there is 0 business. Well, you know what? Year-to-date, we've been 11% down. Quarter -- the third quarter, 1% down. So things are stabilizing here. And North America, which in some subsegments has been a weak spot, is improving. We're making good inroads in health care. We're making good inroads in hospitality, and you're going to hear some more about it pretty soon.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And if I may, raw material costs have come down in general, and they have helped your margins to a certain degree. Do you feel that as of next quarter you are going to have to start giving back pricing?", "William V. Hickey", "Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "No. So Rosemarie, we actually -- we expect the raw materials on hold to kind of stay flat. We're not expecting to give up much in terms of pricing. There may be some modest offset based on the decline we've seen so far in raw material costs, especially as we have some customers on contract, but not a significant impact.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris Manuel at Wells Fargo Securities.", "Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Gabe Hajde on for Chris. You guys have referenced lower equipment sales, I think, once in a press release or the presentation and your remarks. Just talk about the relationship with the consumable, I guess, products for that business. And maybe looking out in 2013, could that have a negative impact on that business?", "William V. Hickey", "Yes. Let me just give you a little background here. Usually, as Jerome very eloquently indicated earlier, so our business is built on the solution where the equipment provides the vehicle for the customers to use our consumables. And that historically, it's about $10 of equipment sales for $100 of consumer sales. So it's a little about 10% of the mix. But it does generate a fair amount of consumer sales. We have looked at equipment placement as an indicator of future consumable sales, but I wouldn't necessarily make any particular conclusion about the comments that we made on the Diversey side. Because equipment placements on protective business are still holding up quite well. And on the food business, they're holding up reasonably well. So I wouldn't necessarily draw a conclusion. But I think it's a good point to keep in mind that positive equipment sales generally drive future consumer sales. And slower equipment sales generally means slower consumer sales growth. But remember the ones that are installed out there become an annuity year-after-year.", "Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And I think there's commentary about $500 million of asset sales or potential asset sales. Can you comment around the portfolio evaluation, whether or not you guys are done or are still looking?", "Carol P. Lowe", "I'll respond to that. Yes, there are additional assets that we're looking at and it's across geographies, across the businesses. So we'll continue to work that through the balance of the year and into 2013. Because our comment on the up to $500 million was over a 12-month period, so we're still looking for opportunities where we have certain either lines of business or product models and things that just don't fit for the long-term strategy.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Having said that, we just went through the big start.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Right. absolutely.", "Operator", "This should come from Phil Gresh.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess, the first question is just on the asset sales as a follow-up, and I apologize if someone already asked this, just tell me. But would you say that a sale of the size you just completed was contemplated in the $500 million target that you gave before or was that kind of...", "Carol P. Lowe", "No. Yes, it was.", "William V. Hickey", "It was.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then if you've talked about this, the outlook for the food businesses in 2013, how you're thinking about volume trends there given the lower slaughter rate potential?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, when you look at the trends, the fresh red meat market in North America is trending negatively. The Latin America across various type of meat, the fresh meats or the smoke and processed meat, the poultry, all of this is trending positively and also slightly negatively in Europe. Having said that, altogether, we're seeing a slight positive trend, call it 1% or so. That's the way we see it at this point in time.", "Operator", "Next question is from Al Kabili at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question on the free cash flow reduction in the guidance, if you could just address what drove that. And also the working capital seasonally just seems to be performing less -- there was a bigger use of cash seasonally than what we're used to, and if you could address that as well.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Well, in my comments, originally, I talked about the working capital, that the biggest impact was the increase in receivables. And the biggest portion of that $59 million increase as we move forward in the quarter was because of the exchange rate. So a higher exchange rate primarily on our European receivables at the end of September versus the end of June and how they're valued on the balance sheet, that accounted for approximately $30 million of the $59 million increase in receivable. Also, seasonally, we have higher sales within our Diversey institutional and laundry business. And in Q3 versus Q2, that also utilized receivables, extended them because those customers tend to have longer payment terms than the rest of our businesses. So that's the biggest driver on working capital. And I also commented about the cash flow for the quarter, we had a large portion of the interest payment that we anticipate making for the full year, was made in Q3, so more than half of it. So that was a big drain on the cash flow as well.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And the reduction in the outlook, is that largely working cap and currency or in this divestiture or is there anything else that drives that reduction versus your [indiscernible]", "Carol P. Lowe", "The reduction is that we're not performing quite at the level we had estimated previously. Some of it is currency, actually a big portion of it is, as well as just managing the overall working capital. We do expect a meaningful reduction in inventory in Q4, but we just haven't hit the levels that we were originally planning.", "Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right, that helps. And just a follow-up on just that Diversey sale. How will you handle this from a branding perspective? There's a lot of established brands, but how are you going to handle this globally now that you've got an outside party in Japan with those brands? And can you comment if the portfolio review would include additional pieces of Diversey?", "William V. Hickey", "This is Bill. Let me comment on the branding because I know it was an item that came up during the negotiations. We have entered into a brand license agreement with the buyers for the Japan business, which runs for a number of years, and they will pay us an ongoing royalty. They will be a distributor for our TASKI systems as well as license the Diversey brand, and they will even keep the Diversey name for a period of time. So those matters are all being worked out as part of the sale process. And the second part of your question is, as Carol indicated earlier, the portfolio review covers our entire business, not just Diversey but as legacy Sealed Air. And I really am not in a position to comment what, if any, pieces of what businesses are being discussed until we have an opportunity to say it at the right time.", "Operator", "We have another question now from George Staphos at Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "One more question. Jerome, what are your initial impressions of Sealed Air prior to [indiscernible] and what, if any, experience from your time at Dow with Rohm and Haas is relevant to [indiscernible]", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So you might -- my first impression is that this is a company, which is in transition in 2012, as I said earlier, and it has potential. And that's the main reason. You might wonder why an EVP of Dow would just come and take the lead at Sealed Air. And the reason is exactly that, is that after the due diligence I have done is that I believe that this company has great potential. As a result of that, I jumped. So the similarity between Dow Rohm and Haas or call it Dow Advanced Materials and Sealed Air are many and more than one might think. Number one, any integration is a delicate process. It's a process where on one side, you go for the cost synergies because you have to; and on the other side, you need to look at the growth synergies and you -- and all of this is enabled by employees. So either you go and build a project or you don't. If you build a project, you're going to engage employees. And if you don't, you're going to have them look somewhere else and away from what you're trying to build. That's what I have done for 3 years at Dow Advanced Materials, and that's what I am spending most of my efforts -- not most of my efforts -- but a lot of efforts right now. I want to federate our employee population. We have 26,500 employees. Those are people who look for the projects of Sealed Air. And I'll tell you, I very, very strongly believe that the right people are the ones that the company needs to build a company and build a project. So the other similarity with Dow Advanced Materials is that this is a specialty business. And any specialty business is built stone-by-stone, brick-by-brick and it takes time. So it takes time, it takes efforts, it takes persistence and it takes employee engagements. That's what I'm really looking at and working. So I'm not miracle man. It's going to take time, but I do believe this company has some potential.", "William V. Hickey", "Operator, we kind of run out of our allotted time. And I know today is a busy day for other calls, and we've moved everyone to Friday. So I would like to thank everyone for your participation.", "I think you see that our third quarter results set the right tone and momentum going into the fourth quarter. Our pending sale of Diversey Japan accelerates our debt reduction and help us to exceed our annual debt targets. Innovation and new solutions continue to be a key factor in our ability to differentiate Sealed Air from our competitors. And we have a number of new products that Jerome indicated we're truly excited about. In the meantime, we're going to continue to focus on executing our plan, integrating Diversey and maximizing free cash flow. Thank you again, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you very much.

And on behalf of all the employees of Sealed Air, I would like to personally thank Bill for his 33 years of service at Sealed Air.", "Getting started now, and on Slide 2 of our presentation. Today marks the first time that we publicly report on our new business segment structure. This change corresponds to how we are managing the business and is an important next step in the direct -- in the Diversey integration. We have filed an 8-K, which will provide you with information on which businesses have been combined to form our new reporting segment.", "Our Food & Beverage division represents about 49% of our total sales; Institutional & Laundry, 28%; and Protective Packaging, 21%. Additionally, our regions are grouped to correspond with how we view the regions internally. Our regions are: North America, which are 39% of our sales; Europe, 33%; Latin America, 11%; AMAT, Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, 10%, which is, as I just said, composing of these regions; and finally, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, which accounts for 7% of our sales. We finished 2012 with $7.65 billion in revenue, with developing regions comprising 24% of our net sales.", "And moving on to Slide 3 of our presentation. I am pleased to report that our adjusted EBITDA was up 17% for the quarter versus the prior year. All of our divisions have had year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin. This improvement was achieved in the face of continuing challenges in Europe and particularly in Southern Europe. Sales in Europe were down 4% and down almost 1% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter. France was down 13%, and in fact, 5% excluding -- are related to foreign exchange and Germany declined 3%, but this was all on unfavorable currency.", "Let me also give you some flavor in the challenges in Southern Europe: Italy was down 7%, 6% FX related; Spain was down 11%, 5% FX related; Portugal declined 21%, 5% FX related; Greece declined 11%, 5% is currency. And we also noticed higher levels of de-stocking at many of our North America customers during the latter half of the quarter. Fortunately, that trend has not continued and sales in January support our de-stocking observation. Tight put-in supplies in North America also continue to pose a challenge, and these challenges are partially offset by continuing growth in developing markets, specifically Latin America, where we achieved 13% constant dollar sales growth and AMAT with a 9% constant dollar sales growth. And more importantly than just growth, these regions are giving us profitable growth. We completed the sale of Diversey Japan in November and used the net proceeds of $313 million to accelerate progress toward net debt reduction. For the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $480 million.", "Our Slide 4 summarizes our year-over-year and sequential performance versus the third quarter of 2012. We continue to achieve positive momentum across a number of key metrics. We are making progress in achieving net sales growth with geographic expansion, developing new and expanded customer relationship and demonstrating the strength of our sustainability, value proposition to customers, which I will talk a little more about shortly. We continue to recognize strong cost synergy. For the quarter, we benefited from $35 million in cost synergies and full year cost synergies totaled over $100 million. These synergies resulted from a mix of headcount reduction, elimination of redundant costs, plant consolidations and procurement and logistics savings. Additionally, we have initiated a range of initiative affecting our pricing structure and policies across all our divisions, and these initiatives will gain momentum as we go forward in 2013. Although demand increased in Q4 versus Q3, adjusted EBITDA and margin declined sequentially. We incurred approximately $10 million in SAR expense in Q4. We also incurred greater advertising and promotion expenses that are seasonally higher in Q4 and also expenses in Europe tend to be lower in the third quarter as this is a heavy vacation season.", "Let's move now to Slide 5. This slide reflects our regions, which cover our 62-country footprint, which continues to give us leading reach and greater opportunity for internal growth than our peers, and we sell into 175 countries. We had very strong growth in Latin America and AMAT, which helped offset some weaknesses in Europe and Japan, Australia and New Zealand.", "Turning to Slide 6. Food & Beverage sales increased 2.4% on a constant dollar basis, with 5.6% organic growth in hygiene solutions and 1.7% in Food Packaging and Food Solutions. Regionally, we have double-digit growth in AMAT and Latin America, where our established footprint and strong market presence in Brazil allowed us to benefit from the rising beef production rate in that country. And while supplies -- protein supplies in North America have negatively impacted our year-over-year performance, we continue to outperform the industry growth rate. For the fourth quarter, our North America fresh red meat packaging product increased sales by approximately 2% compared with an almost 5% decline in beef supply in North America. The gain was partially offset by a 0.7% lower price mix due to pricing pressures in Europe and the impact of contract pricing in North America, causing us some -- to lag some raw materials cost increases in our pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 10.4% and reached a margin of 15.6%, compared with 14.3% in Q4 2011. And the adjusted EBITDA margin benefited from higher volume, cost synergies, expense control and a multi-year network optimization program for legacy Sealed Air.", "I would like to comment on some of our new product sales for the F&B division during the past year. In 2012, we commercialized over a dozen products that drove new sales across multiple regions. Many of our innovations were driven by customer and consumer demand for greater convenience features on packaging, such as our Grip & Tear feature on bags, easy open/reclose on rollstock, including our new FoldLOK pouch system and ovenable materials. Among the products we are most excited about are the Grip & Tear bags. This barrier bag is designed to provide a convenient feature for opening a vacuum package. This product is typically used for the -- for in-the-bag merchandising of products that benefits from extended shelf life. And in most cases, the easy opening feature is accompanied by printed instruction for promotional cooking of the product.", "One of the biggest drivers for our Food & Beverage business is the global demand for food safety and security. For example, we eat more meals outside the home and more food and ingredients come from all over the world. Our Freshness Plus films combined with our Vertical Pouch Packaging program not only keep food safe as it travels longer distance, it extends shelf life and maintains the integrity of the ingredient. Our Vertical Pouch Packaging program has expanded by near double-digit rate.", "When you combine programs such as these with the sustainability hygiene solutions of Diversey such as clean in place and PET bottle track cleaning, we bring a very compelling value proposition to our customers, providing safety, operational efficiency, shelf life extension and product brand protection.", "On to Slide 7. The I&L division has the largest exposure to Europe of any of our divisions, with almost half of the I&L sales coming from that part of the world. Obviously, the economic situation in Europe, particularly Southern Europe, is offsetting the good news that we had in other parts of the world. Consumer brand sales have declined 31% for the quarter, with Southern Europe declining 21%. Machine sales in Europe declined 4.3%, but 17.1% in Southern Europe. Overall, net sales increased 2.4% on a constant dollar basis, with 0.7% higher volume and 1.6% higher price mix, but were flat on a reported basis due to unfavorable currency translation. Volume growth was more significant in Latin America, with new customers in Brazil and Mexico and AMAT, particularly in China and India. North America had a very strong Q4 '11 due to a major consumer brand push, making for a difficult year overall comparison. Even so, North America had some new business in the health care sector, business that we won from some of our larger competitors. On that note, I'm very happy today to announce that we have an agreement in principle, with one of the largest global hospitality chain with a few thousand hotels to be their nominated hygiene solutions supplier globally. The majority of the hotel rooms for this new customer are in the U.S. And this agreement demonstrates our commitment to the growing global hospitality industry and exemplifies our agility to meet our customer needs no matter where they are in the world. Most importantly, I believe it demonstrates the strength of our sustainability value proposition, providing solutions that among other things, deliver consumers higher operational efficiency and reduce waste. This is clearly just one of many examples of the potential we have in this company and shows how sustainability can be a great competitive advantage when you can demonstrate cost and performance on top of sustainability.", "And finally, let's talk about the Protective Packaging division on the Slide 8. Sales increased 1.5% on a constant dollar basis with higher volume, partially offset by lower price mix and unfavorable currency translation. Volume growth was 4.8% in Latin America and expanded market presence and strength in e-commerce application, which showed solid performance during the holiday shopping season, resulting in 4.4% growth in North America. Our packaging system products like Fill-Air inflatable void fill and inflatable bubble cushioning and mailer solutions are ideally suited for faster growing e-commerce and third party logistics application. We also have new products such as Opti shrink film, a micro layer technology enabling higher performance films. This product results in lower total cost for our customer and an improved environmental footprint. We experienced volume challenges, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, were largely due to the impact of a stronger Australian dollar on exports out of that region, as well as lower demand out of China. Competitive pricing pressures also negatively impacted the performance of Protective Packaging in Q4 as many of our competitors did not move to recover raw material cost increase. We are taking action to recover our material cost increases and all of the Sealed Air businesses understand that I consider it unacceptable not to cover these cost increases.", "And now, I will turn the call over to Carol Lowe, our CFO, to discuss fourth quarter financial results in more detail and highlight our outlook for 2013. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. Before we review the remaining slides in our earnings call presentation, I would like to note that we will make available a quarterly summary for 2012 of net sales and adjusted EBITDA by our new segment structure. This information will be made available by the end of this week on our website.", "If you are following along with our presentation, Slide 9 summarizes our consolidated adjusted EBITDA performance. Q4 year-over-year constant dollar adjusted EBITDA improved 17% on $51 million in volume increases, which contributed $17 million to adjusted EBITDA and $35 million in cost synergies as previously highlighted by Jerome. These year-over-year favorable impacts were partially offset by a negative price cost spread of $11 million, higher operating expenses and additional resource investment in high-growth developing regions. While we achieved volume growth and favorable currency impact in Q4 as compared with the third quarter 2012, our adjusted EBITDA and related margin declined modestly on a sequential basis. Jerome noted the $10 million in additional SARs expense in Q4, resulting from the increase in our company stock price during the quarter. The additional sales and marketing expenses were also approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. I would like to note that $10 million increase from Q3 to Q4. I'd also like to note that Q4 and our full year benefited from a reduction in our core effective tax rate. Full year 2012 adjusted earnings per share benefited by approximately $0.04. The core tax rate was reduced by some year end transactions, which will also lower our core effective tax rate in the current year.", "Turning to Slide 10. You will note that Q4 continues to be a strong cash flow quarter. Adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was $266 million for the quarter and $405 million for the full year. Full year 2011 adjusted free cash flow was $318 million. A reduction in net working capital was the primary source of cash for the quarter, with inventory reductions accounting for approximately $125 million, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable. Working capital improvement resulted from targeted programs to reduce inventory and normal seasonal patterns in receivables. Accounts payable balances declined during the quarter in concert with our inventory reduction. Working capital was a use of cash for the full year, with a modest increase in receivables and a decrease in accounts payable more than offsetting the $41 million decline in inventory.", "Foreign-exchange translation had a $14 million unfavorable effect on full year 2012 performance. We have programs in place to achieve working capital improvements in the current year as part of our focus on improving cash flow. Capital expenditures of $124 million in 2012 were roughly equal to those in 2011. With capital investments representing 2% or less of sales in both years. Our capital expenditures have been less than our depreciation expense of $170 million in 2012 and $147 million in 2011. I will speak to our need for slightly higher investment in 2013 when we cover our outlook.", "Moving on to Slide 11. Cash and cash equivalents were $680 million at the end of the year, an increase of $140 million from September 30. As of December 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.5 billion, and our net debt was $4.8 billion. Net proceeds from the sale of Diversey Japan of $313 million were used along with the cash flow from operations to reduce our net debt in Q4 by $483 million. As you think about 2013, please remember that we tend to use cash during the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of the year. In the fourth quarter, we refinanced a portion of our term loan, resulting in annualized cash interest savings of $6 million. We also refinanced our 5 5/8% senior notes, which were scheduled to mature this July, with $425 million of 6.5% senior notes that mature in 2020. Thus reducing our near-term funding requirement, and it's moving our debt maturity schedule. We have included our new debt maturity ladder as an appendix to the presentation. We will continue to look to the market to opportunistically extend our maturities and/or reduce our interest rate. We continue to plan to use our excess cash flow to pay our dividend, reduce debt and prudently invest in the business.", "Slide 13 highlights our outlook for the current year. While our top line growth outlook is tempered by flat to negative GDP growth projection for Europe and low single-digit growth estimates for the United States, we are estimating 2013 net sales in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion, which compares with the $7.65 billion net sales for 2012. Our focus on quality of earnings improvement is estimated to realize adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated in the range of $1.10 to $1.20.", "We continue to estimate the total restructuring program benefit will be between $195 million and $200 million through 2014, an incremental benefit of approximately $90 million in 2013 compared with 2012. I would like to remind you that we have a heavy employee base and part of this $90 million in savings over 2012 from the restructuring program will be used to fund inflationary cost for that employee base of approximately $50 million to $60 million. Our free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, is estimated at approximately $300 million to $350 million in 2013. This estimate is net of approximately $70 million in restructuring payment. You should compare the $300 million and $350 million with free cash flow of $280 million in 2012.", "The $405 million of adjusted free cash flow presented on Slide 10 excluded approximately $80 million of restructuring charges and other balance sheet changes of approximately $40 million. 2013 estimated free cash flow will also be impacted by higher capital expenditures as compared with 2012. As I previously noted, our capital investments have been 2% or less of sales for several years, and our spend has been less than depreciation expense. In 2013, we estimate capital spending of approximately $160 million, which will include investments for targeted strategic growth, as well as cost-reduction projects. Our capital spending will also include approximately $20 million related to the rollout of our ERP system to certain legacy Diversey operation. This rollout will be a multi-year project, with completion estimated for 2015. Our interest payments are estimated at $320 million, and our core effective tax rate is estimated at 26% for the current year.", "I would like to also briefly comment on the potential impact of the recent devaluation in Venezuela. We estimate the 32% devaluation announced by the Venezuelan government on February 8 will result in a loss of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter, and that is a pretax loss. And that's mostly due to trapped cash balances that are held in local currency. The outlook I just described does not include this potential loss as it would be an add back as a not normal operations in the way we present adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We would like -- we, like other companies with business in Venezuela, have been challenged in ways to minimize our exposure to the fluctuations in that economy, particularly with cash balances. We could have operational losses related to the currency devaluation, but that impact is unknown at this time. Our total annual sales in Venezuela are less than $50 million and that was prior to the currency devaluation. I'd also want to highlight though that they are profitable sales with a double-digit margin.", "Before turning the call back to Jerome to lead the Q&A, I would like to note that we have included in the appendix of the presentation a summary of our 2012 adjusted earnings per share calculation for your reference to assist in how we go from our adjusted EBITDA to our adjusted earnings per share number.", "And now, I'll turn the call back to Jerome. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Carol. Operator, I would like to open the call up to any questions from the participants.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from the Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, first question I had, you mentioned in the press release, you're going to be aggressively managing the cost structure and also paraphrasing here, you're going to be even more decisive in taking action on pricing. Directionally, we know what you mean by that, but could you give us perhaps a bit more color where you need to do the most work on both areas relative to your various segments and then I have a follow-on.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So 2 questions. The first one is on the cost. The second one on the pricing. With regards to the cost, we are not done with our cost synergies, and you have noted or in the document it is written that we have approximately another $90 million of cost synergies to grow, so that's one. The second on -- and continuing on this, you know Europe is going to have around 0 GDP growth in 2013. I don't know what you think 2014 is going to be, but I think it's going to be many years before Europe comes back and enjoys a 2% GDP growth. As a result of that, and given our employee base in our structure, we need to make sure that we remain cost competitive, which means that we will need to make sure that our cost don't overinflate compared to the size of our growth potential, which by definition is going to be limited. So with regards to pricing, my observation is that we -- still there has not been a price champion and has not necessarily been paid for its IQ and if you allow me a second here, we are not a bag, a food protein bag seller. We are not only a protective packaging product seller. We have a lot of IQ. Our people design plan with our customers. They apply Lean Sigma technology to help shape the plant, the equipment and finally commercialize products because we produce equipment also. We're not rewarded for this. So that's one side of our pricing, which I think that we need to understand better. And the reason why I say that is that either  the customer values those kind of IQ, and we need to be paid for it, or they don't. In that case, we need to stop serving them with this kind of service. And then next to that you have the inflation or the volatility of raw material. And here I come from an industry where -- and that I know pretty well, which was more basic integrated and where the ethylene prices and the propylene prices at the beginning of the year 2000, they were slowly moving up and down. That's not the case anymore. Now raw materials, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, et cetera, benzene, et cetera, they move very quickly. We can't leave the price protection that we were having. We need to be very diligent in passing those because we just simply don't have the margin to absorb them for a period of time. So my motto in Sealed Air is, the leader leads, we need to be prepared to lead in pricing when we lead in the market.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My follow-on would be, do you feel you have enough intelligence at this juncture in terms of your competitive positioning, the value add that your products are bringing to your various customers and their verticals to go at pricing and not disadvantage your business, not lose market share that you ultimately wouldn't want to lose? Ultimately, there'll be some mistakes in the process, but how do you feel about your intelligence at this juncture?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "I will conclude by saying that there are tools. There are -- there is technology to assess pricing and by definition nobody wants to make a stupid mistakes, but things are -- we want to be prudent, but again, if the leader doesn't lead then there are issues, and I believe that -- it's called isoprofit curve, and those are models that we need to work on, et cetera, but I don't think it needs to be necessarily a confrontation. We are entitled to get reinvestment to have reinvestment economics. This is no more. And everybody wants strong supplier. And in some segments, we don't have reinvestment economics, and we need to be better at that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Can you give us some parameters on this new operating structure, operating segment structure you have per unit on how we should think about volumes as we look at '13 versus '12? And I guess, there's a lot of -- you touched on the protein supply, for example, in the food side, but there's also a meat contamination scare in Europe. I wonder if that's also factoring into your outlook there.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Why don't you start, Carol, and I'll talk about Europe meat contamination.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. So Ghansham, if you're asking about a breakdown by region for 2013, we're not providing that specificity. What we will say is that, for the European region, we expect, as Jerome commented, kind of flat growth. The economy there will be flat to negative as been published for North America and specifically with the United States, less than 2% growth there. We think we'll slightly outperform what the GDP growth will be for North America. We are projecting that we will have nice growth within the developing region, within the Latin America countries, specifically with Brazil, and then with what we classify as AMAT, which is Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, that we will have solid growth rates there. Typically, within the developing regions, we'll see high single-digit to lower double-digit, we -- so those would be our expectations. Does that answer, address your question?", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, and then the contamination issue, Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So the contamination, you can imagine that we are following this from very close. We are constantly talking with our leading customers. And at this minute, it looks like the most affected food segment is the prepared food. Luckily enough, we are small in the prepared food packaging segment. So we are not that worried about an immediate impact. There is some potential speculation that there might be an increase in the fresh meat and in the freshly packed meat in supermarkets. But we're not anticipating this at this point in time, but I hope this gives you some help.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, and just a follow-up, kind of piggybacking on George's question, so if you kind of think about the EBITDA bridge '13 versus '12, you gave us some parameters, right, volume, synergies. If you look at price cost specifically, do you expect that to be positive, neutral or negative for 2013 versus '12?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well our objective is to recoup at least our cost increases.", "Operator", "Next question comes from line of Phil Gresh of JPM.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "The first question is just, as we think about the resegmentation of the businesses, and I look at the EBITDA margins of Institutional & Laundry versus Food & Beverage and Protective Packaging, and George was kind of asking about the cost versus the pricing elements, I'm just kind of wondering how you feel about what levers you have available within that business to improve your margins. Do you feel like pricing needs to be a big element of that or do you feel like it's cost savings or is it a business that's structurally going to be lower than these other businesses, just some color on how you're thinking about it?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So I&L. I&L is having clearly unacceptable EBITDA margins at this point in time. And therefore, we are working on several fronts. Number one, we're working on our cost structure. Specifically, in the geographies where we're most exposed, which is the European region. And as a result of that and given the cost of delayering in Europe, you know that this is something that we are taking, that we are making, but we're making it carefully. Second, we are accentuated our growth in emerging countries. We are very satisfied with the progress that we're making in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. With our growth in I&L, including also in Latin America. We're doing very well. We have double-digit growth in most of the places where we are operating. And most of the time, we are gaining market share. And this is where you're going to see us continuing to make this proportional investment. And finally, no I do not expect to be aggressive on price because I don't think pricing is the solution. I think that we are going to be making a lot of progress as soon as we can convince our customers that we have critical mass and that we are a credible alternative to what their current solution is. And when we have them, that we can continue offering them improved better solutions than the ones we are currently offering them. This is therefore going to convince them that we have critical mass everywhere and that we have improved and better sustainable technology because we do have compared to our -- their alternative, we believe better and improved sustainability solution. And as a result of that, we expect that we are going to be growing. So it's not cost, cost, cost reduction. It is specifically more of that in the places where we believe we unfortunately cannot count on growth to help us. It is this proportional investment where we believe that we have the competitive advantage and where there is growth, and it is also sustainability, which we count as being our enhanced value proposition.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "My follow-up question is just on the red meat side. There's significant outperformance there in the fourth quarter. And is that something you see as sustainable in 2013 and what would you say are the key drivers of why Sealed Air is doing so well in this area?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So a mix of several things. Number one, we're coming back -- you have negatively reacted to our second quarter, and this might have been an overreaction. We believe that our product stewardship, our innovation and those kind of things are enabling us to more of the kind of margins that your have seen in the third and in the fourth quarter than the ones that you have in the second. That's one. So back to normal, I would say. Second, we have introduced new products, which have a lot of traction. Third, we are not only red meat dependent in our Food Packaging business, but we are also have providing Vertical Pouches, which are very good solutions for our customers. Third, we have in our Food & Beverage division that you see now, we have nicely grown in hygiene solution, which is an important business, of which we are actually working strongly in improving its quality, and we're making good inroads in several parts of the world.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "As part of your discussion around being able to push for price because you do offer a total solution to your customers, one of the things that you've been known for, for quite some time is your spend on R&D. I think about 2 percentage points, 2% of sales going towards R&D, do you think that's a sustainable level going forward? Do you need to spend that much in order to create these products and maybe you could kind of talk about that in the future where we could see that level of R&D spend go?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "We will tell you much more about this when we have our Investor Day. We haven't picked the date, but it is going to be end of second quarter or some time in the third quarter. So you will have a full exposure to this. Now, level of R&D is -- we're not going to give justice to it right now in a few -- in a minute or so. My view is that innovation, successful innovation makes -- ensures your future in order to decommoditize. My view of a specialty product is that it is simply a product on its way to commoditization, which means that you need to renew your portfolio with successful innovation. We do have some amazing, amazing innovation in Sealed Air, which we are introducing, which we're pushing, and I could name several, but I'm not going to start that journey because of lack of time. We're spending about $140 million in R&D in Sealed Air this year. Is it too little? Is it too much? I haven't decided. What I want to first measure is the productivity of our R&D. And it's not necessarily a question of dollars, it's a question of quality. I want to make sure that in every single segment, which means in every single of our division, we have best-in-class R&D, which allows us to bring the solutions that our customers need. And they are in product or they are in systems, and they are here in order to surprise our customers with those, which makes them win. So we have to add value, and I am constantly hammering on this trilogy, which is the three-legged stool of sustainability, cost competitiveness and performance. And the new innovation is a great innovation if it answers those 3 questions favorably. So stay tuned and we'll talk more about that.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, I look forward to the Analyst Day. The other question is around the growth investments, I think mostly in Institutional & Laundry, you added a number of salespeople in 2012, can you talk about how much you spend on new sales, on those growth investments in 2012 and how much we should expect you to spend in 2013 and then maybe when we should see the benefits?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "I don't have exact numbers, and as I'm going to make some comments, maybe Carol can add that, but yes, we are adding some salespeople in some parts of the world because we do believe that we have critical mass and a competitive advantage. We are adding some in the U.S. because of the contract that I just announced, and we are going to execute flawlessly. And as a result of that, we are going to be able to again, to price positively our customers in I&L on this specific contract. But we are also adding in some parts, some other parts of the world where we are seeing growth, and as I said, we are expecting double-digit growth in some, in most of the emerging countries.", "Carol P. Lowe", "So as a follow-on to that, Jerome, the EBITDA bridge that we included in the earnings slide deck, the $22 million negative as you do the EBITDA bridge for SG&A, that includes a little less than $10 million in additional resource investment and most of those resource investment have been made within developing regions, and primarily within AMAT. We have also for the I&L business added some number of resources to support growth within North America for specific market factors.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "When we look at your EBITDA and sales guidance for 2013 versus your results in 2012, the midpoint of your outlook appears to assume very little margin improvement and given the pricing actions you're taking and some of the cost reduction, is this potentially conservative? And then looking at I&L specifically, given your view that margins there are unacceptable, but understanding restructuring can take time, should we think about margin improvement in I&L as more of a 2014 event or can you talk about the potential to improve I&L margins in 2013?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well you have noted that we have changed our President of I&L. She is assessing the whole situation and already starting to take some decisions. So this is a business which has been suffering from probably too many changes in ownership over the past few years. So step one is to stabilize, step two is to turn it around. I am optimistic, but I'm not going to go and say that it's going to happen in 6 months. I think your 2014 is a good timing, Anthony. Generally speaking, I would say that the reason why I want to take some very firm positions on pricing is that I have observed that over time, Sealed Air has lost EBITDA, including through lack of pricing momentum. My view is that, we need to be firm on this because we are adding a lot of value to our customers, including from the aspects that I talked about earlier, helping in some engineering, selling the best-in-class equipment, including in vacuum chambers and vacuum equipment, et cetera, best-in-class. We have huge market shares on those, and we are potentially not valuing all of these properly. At the very same time -- and you'll understand that those kind of things are some kind of cultural changes that take also a little bit of time. The reason why I'm so emphatic on pricing at this minute is that some of our colleagues in the polyethylene industry and polypropylene industry and polystyrene industry have been jacking prices in a quite substantial way in January and wanted to do the same in February. And this can -- these are big increases that we need to pass on. And before getting margin expansion, you need to prevent having margin contraction. And this is why I'm saying that this is very important.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a quick question for Carol. Carol, you referenced the ERP spend $20 million in '13, and that the project ends in 2015. Do those ERP costs ramp down through 2015 or how should we think about CapEx potentially in 2014, 2015 from an ERP perspective?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So they would be about consistent to potentially slightly larger in 2014 with not as much spend in 2015 because we will be wrapping up the implementation at that time. We are also benefiting from the fact that we have a significantly trained, well-trained workforce internally that implemented this ERP in prior years across Sealed Air, so we're able to leverage our internal IS team as opposed to having to rely a lot on external resources for the implementation. So we feel like we'll be able to tightly control the spend for the total implementation of the project.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "In terms of the EBITDA bridge from '12 to '13, of the improvement you're assuming, can you give some sense of how much is coming from FX, how much is coming from synergies and volume growth and what some of the offsets are to the $25 million-ish of improvement that you're guiding to?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Well, I guess, Adam, we had commented that we will have about $90 million in synergies, and I also noted that based on our current workforce size, that we spend about $50 million to $60 million on an inflationary basis representing compensation increases as well as benefit cost increases. So that's utilizing a good bit of those synergy savings. We haven't really commented specifically about volume, let's say, low to mid -- low single-digits. If you want to think about it in total, I previously gave comments on one of the questions how we were looking at it relative to each of the regions. So from a currency perspective, what we have estimated or what we used, if you want to use the euro as a proxy, we're using 1.27 euro/U.S. dollar comparison as the rate. And then for the full year, we -- I'll check my notes to see where we ended up. I know for Q4, we were slightly, I think we were about $1.29 before we would have ended the year, and that was about the average a little bit less from that for Q4, so you could use that just to -- as an estimate from a currency impact.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Just one follow-on. You have the $90 million of incremental synergies, partly offset by the higher labor, are there -- is there anything that would enable you to offset that labor inflation in subsequent years post the synergies?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Well, I think, as Jerome commented, that we do have a focus on Lean Six Sigma, continuous improvement. So we'll always be looking at cost structure, and I think -- and he also provided color specific to the I&L business. So there, we will always look that a way to make sure we're covering our inflationary cost as best we can.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "The answer here is that we have to. We are a manpower-intensive company. 25 -- over 25,000 employees with $8 billion of sales. This is very clearly a manpower-intensive company. Some are in manufacturing and supply-chain, and that line is just normal to produce what we produce. The others are in the service business. And when you have, when you're in the service business, you need to get paid for the service. And therefore, it is very key that through expanded margin, we get paid for the improvement of productivity that we need to get.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Your volumes in protective was actually noticeably stronger than the last 2 quarters, I know Q4 is a big e-commerce quarter, so was that most of the strength coming from and when you look out to Q -- 2013, do you see some of that flowing through?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "There is a seasonality in this business. We are making good inroads in our e-commerce business. And we also have been launching some new shrink films, which are absolutely revolutionary. They are -- have higher clarity. They have lower gauge and extremely performing decent. They have great value proposition for our customers, and we are having good initial success out of those.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it sounds like there's some momentum heading into 2013. And then, I guess, a follow-up, on the free cash flow guidance for 2013, the $300 million to $350 million, if I heard you correctly, Carol, there's about $80 million in restructuring cash cost, so when we look out to 2014, should we expect most of that fading and how should we be thinking about CapEx?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes, there won't be much in the way of restructuring charges under the current program that you'll see in 2014. It would be less than $20 million and probably even less than may -- maybe potentially less than $15 million. It's largely depending on timing of severance since a lot of the synergy cost savings are related to resource reduction. From a CapEx standpoint, as I noted for 2013, we're estimating $160 million in spend. For 2014, provided we perform in 2013 and are able to continue to reduce our debt, we would expect to not have any less than that investment. And hope that we'll be able to have the improvement in the profit of the business to provide not only cash for that restructuring, but also investments. And also just to clarify the $80 million that you referenced, the 2013 restructuring payments are actually $70 million.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So is that a good way to think about normalized free cash flow going forward when you account for less restructuring cost and CapEx for 2014 and forward?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So what we're doing is, we want to make it more simple for everyone to understand the free cash flow and be able to look at the GAAP financial statement. The cash flow from operations and deduct CapEx. That is a standard definition of free cash flow, and what we will do is call out the unusual items that we are spending cash on, such as restructuring charges. We think that will make it easier. We've had some confusion with some of the nonstandard operating add backs that we do, and we think this will provide better clarity. So yes, you can just follow from the GAAP financial, and we will call out the specific items for you to treat in your models the way you best -- that you decide are best to handle.", "Operator", "That is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Peribere, I will now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, I want to thank you for attending today. We have published those results and our guidance for 2013. We are -- we have had the month of January, which we would qualify as being satisfactory. It confirms that there's been some destocking in December, and at the very same time, we are looking forward for achieving the guidance that we have given to you during the pre-call and during this earnings call. We look forward to talk to you in the second quarter. And with this, I'd like to close this conference. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much for your participation in today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions]", "And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Thomas, Assistant Treasurer and Interim Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Thomas.", "Bill Thomas", "01", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at www.sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed on our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at www.sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.", "Please note that we will end the call by noon today with Q&A wrapping up by 11:55 a.m.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Bill. Good morning. A pleasure to talk to you about our first quarter results, and let me just go ahead and summarize by saying, I believe we had a good quarter. Actually, a very good -- a very good quarter. Not so much because of the financials, which are in line with our expectations for the first quarter and in line with our guidance for the full year in terms of EBITDA, of improved cash flow in the first quarter compared to what we did last year, et cetera, but because we have made superb improvements in setting the stage for the new Sealed Air.", "We have created a new vision, a new mission, new core values, which will be introduced in detail in our September -- at our September investor meeting. They are key to clarifying who we are and confirm why we exist. And they're based on 3 pillars: Performance, sustainability and cost-competitiveness. Our employees are on fire. They breathe a new extraordinary energy in this company. We polled our 25,000 employees to a survey during the first quarter. We took the pulse, and this allowed us to create employee engagement and alignment, which obviously will be pursued. I'm committed to make Sealed Air a thriving place to work, including to the future development of increase in performance compensation -- in performance-based compensation, alignment of equity among our heritage companies and increased transparency.", "We have started to better align our innovation through an intense dialogue with our key partners and customers, and in order to improve, also, our return on our R&D dollars. We have and will continue to recruit externally or internally, high, very high-caliber talent as we did in January with our President of Institutional & Laundry; in April, with our new General Counsel; and soon, with a new CTO and a Communications VP. And we are building a more streamlined, efficient, accountable organization as a result of an announcement that I will make in a few minutes. This was a very busy quarter.", "And now, let me just go into the numbers. Despite strong economic challenges in our developed market, especially in Europe, we finished the quarter with an improved month in our total operating results. Excluding the impact of the legacy Diversey stock appreciation rights, or what is referred to as SARs, our adjusted EBITDA and our margin have improved. While it's a small step, it is one in the right direction.", "As highlighted on Slide 2 of our presentation, sales for the quarter were up 0.4% on 1% higher volume and 2% price mix, offset by 0.8% of unfavorable foreign exchange translation. We continue to achieve growth in developing regions, especially Latin America, where we achieved 12% growth in constant dollar, and Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, with an 8% constant dollar sales growth.", "The increase was achieved in the face of continuing challenges, particularly in Southern Europe, as well as sporting [ph] supply challenges in North America and Europe. Sales in Europe actually declined approximately 3% on a reported and constant basis for the quarter, while North American sales were about flat with last year.", "Our adjusted EBITDA was flat for the quarter versus prior year, if you include the $18 million of expense from SARs. SARs expenses were $12 million last year in the first quarter. And our exposure to SARs expense is a function of the value of our share price, and since our share price increased during the first quarter, our SARs expense increased as well. Excluding the impact of SARs, though, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $245 million or 13.2% of sales as compared to $240 million or 13% of sales for the first quarter of last year. We continue to achieve positive momentum across a number of key metrics. We're achieving net sales growth with geographic expansion, developing new and expanded customer relationship, and demonstrating the strength and the breadth of our sustainability value proposition to customers. We continue to recognize strong cost synergies. For the quarter, we benefited from $29 million in incremental cost synergies under our 2011, 2014 integration and optimization program compared with the first quarter of 2012. These synergies resulted from a mix of headcount reductions, elimination of redundant cost, plant consolidations, and procurement and logistics savings.", "If you move to Slide 3, our 62-country footprint continues to provide us with leading reach and great opportunity for international growth, better than our peers and where we -- and in fact, we're selling to 175 countries globally. And here, we have the tale of 2 worlds. In Western Europe, we had very bad growth with -- Western Europe has been very bad for us, led by France where our sales have gone down 10%. And you probably have noticed through economic information that France was the worst country in the first quarter out of the 4 largest West European countries. Spain was at minus 5%, but our sales have been stabilizing in Italy. North America was flat for us, but we have growth in I&L, Institutional & Laundry. Eastern Europe was very strong with double-digit growth in U.K. -- in Ukraine and Russia, for example. It was a little bit weak in Australia, weak in Japan because of devaluation, but very strong in Brazil; in Argentina, where we had double-digit growth in constant currencies; in Colombia; very strong also in AMAT with 13% growth in Turkey, 11% in China, India, Korea and so forth. So a tale of 2 worlds, very clearly, where we are continuing to do extremely well in emerging countries and where Western European countries, and especially Southern European countries, where we are very exposed, have been suffering very much from economic conditions.", "And turning now onto Slide 4, and you'll see Food & Beverage sales have increased 1.9% on a constant dollar basis, with 2.4% organic growth in hygiene solutions and 1.7% in food packaging solutions. Our deployment of new products continues to add to our top line. In North America, our Grip & Tear, Darfresh, Oven Ease and Instapak products are value-added for the consumer and continued to gain share. Additionally, we are rolling out many of these products in Latin America now, and regionally, we experienced double-digit growth in AMAT and in Latin America, where our established footprint and strong market presence in Brazil enabled us to continue to benefit from rising beef production rates in that country. Protein supplies in North America had negatively impacted our year-on-year performance. Whereas the North American beef production declined 2.8% in the first quarter, following the 3.3% industry decline in Q4 of last year, our volumes to the U.S. fresh red meat sector declined by less than 1%, and we have pretty solid growth, non-U.S., with positive growth of 3.5%. We experienced strong equipment sales in Latin America and AMAT, but Southern Europe was a challenge due to the decline in protein supply and demand. F&B sales in France declined, for example, 9%. And sales to Spain were down 1%. The benefits of operating a global business were clearly demonstrated in the quarter as we achieved strong sales performance for fresh red meat applications in Latin America and Japan and Australia and New Zealand.", "Central and Eastern Europe saw year-over-year growth improvements, particular in Russia, which contributed 9% organic growth. Overall, F&B adjusted EBITDA was 14.5%, or actually 15% if you exclude SARs, compared to 14.1%, or 14.4% if you exclude SARs, for the first quarter of 2012.", "Adjusted EBITDA margin benefited from higher volumes, operational efficiencies and reduced expenses. And additionally, contractual pricing provisions in North America continued to cause us to lag raw material cost increases for some of our resins. And as a reminder, market prices for polyethylene in North America have increased 12% since January, which obviously takes a little bit of time to pass. And during our Q1, our F&B division implemented various pricing actions in response to these material cost increases, as well as rising inflation. The range of our announced price increases vary by country and by products, but we were not able to fully offset these increases during the first quarter, but expect to do so by the end of the second quarter as our contracts reset and announced price increases are fully implemented. Passthrough contracts are more commonly used in North America than in other regions, and we continue to pursue opportunities with our customers to shorten the reset period or lag time, especially in light of this kind of very steep polyolefin price increases that we suffer from. But we're also very pleased with our renewed discipline on price.", "Moving on to Slide 5, that one highlights the result from our Institutional & Laundry division. As you know, I&L has the largest exposure to Europe of any of our divisions, with almost half of its sales generated in Europe. Obviously, the economic situation in Europe, particularly Southern Europe where we are fairly exposed, is offsetting the good news that we have in other parts of the world. As a whole, sales to Southern Europe were down 8%. Specifically, sales in Spain and France were both down 11%, with sales to Italy down by 10%. And sales growth was most significant in Latin America, with strong organic growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. AMAT, particularly China and India, had double-digit organic growth in sales during the quarter. Volumes in North America also increased 2.5%. Flow care machines sales were weak, mainly in Europe, which accounts -- and heavily weaker, which accounts for 2/3 of global decline machine sales as customers, particular in the public sector, continue to very carefully manage their cash spend. Nevertheless, the sales decline in the machine sector represents an improvement over the global 5% decline that we witnessed in 2012.", "Adjusted EBITDA was challenged due to sales expenses, but also was impacted by negative customer mix, inflationary costs and the timing of certain expenses, which I'm not going to detail in here. During the first quarter, I&L implemented price increase in most of their geographies. These increases reflect the combination of lease price increases and, where relevant, also, specific customer-by-customer increases, generating a positive price cost spread in the quarter.", "Moving now to Protective Packaging on Slide 6, where we show sales that declined by 0.8% on a constant dollar basis with essentially flat volumes, offset by lower price/mix and unfavorable currency translation. The unfavorable price/mix is, in fact, attributable to increased sales to consumer-based customers, as well as reduced sales from -- of specialty foam products and the governmental projects. And the weakness in the industrial sector, because of industrial GDP lack of growth, is very obvious through our product mix. We had -- our cushioning business went down 3%. Our shrink business, which is partly consumer goods, went down 1%, but our packaging systems, which is more attributable to our e-commerce business, has been up by 5%. So net sales for e-commerce and third-party logistics providers continue to grow very nicely, but were offset, as I said, by the global manufacturing weakness, and again, once again, weak sales in Europe at minus 4%. And North America was slightly positive at over 1%, plus 1%. And in the end, adjusted EBITDA was 4.6% lower and was impacted by unfavorable customer mix and an unfavorable price cost spread. And during this first quarter, Protective Packaging, like our other businesses, announced price increases. Although some price increases were effective late in the first quarter, the majority took effect on April 1 because quite a lot of those -- our sales in Protective Packaging are going through distribution. And it takes quite a lot of time to be able to have all the SKUs from our sales and from the sales in the systems of our customers' distributors to be effective and implemented.", "So we anticipate positive price cost spreads for the remainder of 2013, despite some recent information that some competitors have been rescinding some of their original moves as they are trying to push volume.", "And now, turning to Slide 7. And as I have been communicating since joining Sealed Air, we are committed to margin improvement and alignment of our cost structure. We have identified opportunities all -- across all of our divisions, as well as in our corporate functions. As a result, we are announcing our new earnings quality improvement program through which we expect to obtain annual savings of $80 million by the end of '15. Cumulative costs for the program are estimated in the range of about $180 million to $200 million, and this program will implement much of the delayering I've been speaking about, resulting in a leaner organization structure, better-aligned, more accountable to serve our customers and improve our earnings over time. The savings under this program will be minimal for 2013 and are incremental to the cost synergies under the 2011, 2014 integration and optimization program.", "And finally, I'd like to note that we have set a date for our 2013 Investor Day. It will be on September 20 in New York City. And the Sealed Air leadership team will present to you a review of each of our divisions, provide a 3-year forecast and provide details on our strategic priorities and our long-term target. We will share additional details on location and timing as we get closer to the event.", "And now, I will turn the call over to Carol Lowe to discuss the first quarter financial results in more detail and highlight our outlook for the remainder of 2013. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you are following along with your presentation, Slide 8 provides a bridge for the change in our net sales from the first quarter 2012 to 2013.", "Volumes contributed $19 million year-over-year, with a small positive price/mix from Food & Beverage and Institutional & Laundry, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix for Protective Packaging. Overall, our price/mix was $3 million positive. Currency translation was $14 million unfavorable, primarily driven by declines in Latin American currency.", "Moving to Slide 9, this reflects the adjusted EBITDA bridge from the first quarter 2012 to 2013. As Jerome discussed, we benefited from $29 million in incremental cost synergies during the first quarter of 2013. Volume contributed $7 million to EBITDA. SG&A costs were $17 million unfavorable year-over-year on increased compensation and benefit cost, cost to support growth in developing regions and new business, as well as the timing impact of certain expenses that were different than 2012. As we noted on the Q4 earnings call, the full year effect of compensation and benefit increases is approximately $55 million to $60 million. Highlighting once again, the SARs expense was $18 million during Q1, or $6 million higher versus Q1 2012. While the amount of the SARs expense is not linear, and as most of you know, Black-Scholes is complicated, a change in the value of Sealed Air stock price based on the current amount of SARs outstanding, we estimate that for every $1 change in our stock price, it impacts EBITDA by approximately $2.5 million. As of mid-April, we had approximately $2.4 million in SARs outstanding in terms of the number of SARs.", "Now turning to Slide 10, please note that the first quarter is our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter. Free cash flow was the use of $65 million in Q1 2013. This is a very meaningful improvement over a use of $125 million in the first quarter of 2012. The $60 million improvement was due to higher net earnings and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in receivables. The company has set several metrics around improvement and working capital. Our supply chain team has been making excellent progress in the management of our supplier payment terms. In addition to Q1 being a seasonally low cash flow quarter, we typically use cash during the first half of the year. Most of our cash flow's generated during the last half of the year.", "During Q1, we make certain onetime annual payments, such as annual incentive compensation awards. We also pay semiannual interest on our 2 largest bonds and have a seasonal inventory build. As stated during our Q4 earnings call, we have programs in place to achieve working capital improvements in 2013 as part of our continued disciplined cash flow management focus with reduced leverage as a key use for our cash.", "Moving on to Slide 11, cash and cash equivalents were $626 million at March 31. As of March 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.5 billion. Our net debt was $4.9 billion at the end of March, an increase of approximately $92 million mainly due to the seasonal cash flow needs I previously discussed. During Q1, we purchased our 7 7/8 senior notes, due 2017. We were able to repurchase them with the proceeds of our new 5 1/4 10-year senior notes. We have a manageable debt maturity schedule, and we will continue to look to the market to opportunistically extend our maturities and/or reduce our interest rates. We continue to plan to use our excess cash flow to reduce our debt, pay our dividend and prudently invest in the business via a disciplined expenditure process.", "Slide 12 highlights our outlook for the remainder of 2013. We are maintaining our full-year net sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, also in line with our prior guidance. Finally, we continue to forecast adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. As a result of the cash cost associated with the earning quality improvement program Jerome discussed, we are estimating our full-year free cash flow will now be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which compares with $280 million for the year ended 2012.", "Cost reduction benefits under this new program will be minimal for 2013. We are continuing with the review of our portfolio and we'll monetize nonstrategic assets to fund our restructuring programs so not to negatively impact our ability to reduce our leverage. The first quarter of 2013 benefited from a core tax rate of 19.4%, which compares with 22.3% for the first quarter of 2012. This represents approximately a $0.01 favorable impact year-over-year. We benefited in the U.S. from the retroactive extension by Congress of certain items, including the R&D benefit. We expect our core tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for the full year. Interest expense for 2013 is expected to be approximately $355 million, which includes approximately $290 million of cash interest expense.", "Before turning the call back to Jerome to lead the Q&A, I would like to note that we have included in the appendix of the presentation a summary of our first quarter adjusted earnings per share calculations for your reference. We believe you'll find this schedule useful as you update your models to walk from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted earnings per share.", "Jerome, I'll now turn the call back to you for Q&A.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Okay. Well, thank you, Carol. Operator, I'd like to open the call up to any questions from the participants.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is on pricing. Could you provide, perhaps, a bit more granularity on what you expect to achieve in net price cost in the second quarter, and -- considering the challenges that you have in I&L from a European standpoint on the volume side and the fact that it looks like at least the market factors are making a little bit more difficult in Protective Packaging to put through pricing? And then I had a follow-on.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Sure. So, George, thank you for your question. The 12% Q1 polyolefin cost increase is not a small amount. And what we have been doing is, to recreate energy and focus onto our sales force, we have -- we're separating the function of sales from marketing and we're forcing a very much more diligent approach to our pricing. We need to get that done, you heard me say that, and I'm going to continue and I'm very strong within the company in doing this. So then you look at our customer mix and you look at it as a result of the businesses in which we are. Protective Packaging, as I said in my prepared remarks, are about distribution. There are lots, lots, lots of SKUs, and as a result of that, it takes a little bit of more time. But this is why we haven't announced -- we have announced our price increases, but they have been implemented late in the Q -- in the first quarter and most of them going to in Q1 -- in April 1. In Q2 -- and then F&B is a different story, bigger customers, and we have been making better inroads with regards to implementing what we needed to implement. Actually, I can see that right now in the gross profit to net sales. Let me give you 2 numbers. In F&B for the quarter, our gross profit to net sales improved by 20 basis points. But in March, our net profit -- our gross profit to net sales improved by 80 basis points. So it should tell you something. I'm not saying the whole thing is by definition pricing, but it is also pricing. On Protective Packaging, we have a lag for the reasons I've told you. We lost 40 basis points for the quarter, but in March, we lost less than 30 basis points for the month of March. So here again, I don't want to mislead anybody, but it is also about our pricing being implemented and being successful. We need to get that, the demand is not there, but the ethylene cycle is there. And therefore, I want to have our people very conscious of this because even if situations improve on a given month, the trend is not going to be a positive one until new big ethylene -- polyethylene capacities come to the marketplace, and we know when they're going to come, and therefore, we are, in the meantime, being diligent about those things. So clearly, to your question, a new mindset and when do I expect this to happen, I'm expecting to recover everything and more by the end of the second quarter.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, appreciate the color in that, Jerome. Second question I had, and I'll turn it over obviously, switching gears to I&L. Can you comment to the degree to which you're being able to service some of the new awards you've received, given that you may have some difference in the way that you go to market and service customers versus some of your more substantial competitors, especially in light of the fact that we are obviously going to see more cost reductions within the business and within I&L, even though some of that's probably more centered in Europe? Help us understand your progress there.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So you've got large contracts and you've got smaller contracts there. For the larger contracts, so we, in the places where we don't have critical mass, we are selectively hiring to serve the customers, and we're making pretty good progress in serving and converting those contracts there. That's work in progress. There is in this industry, a new word, which I have learned because I didn't know it existed. Those are called freebate. I didn't know what that meant until I have been told that they were invented by this industry and this is -- I'm not going to comment on this, but this is crazy. But that's the way it is. So in terms of accretion to sales, we're not seeing them -- or to our business or our results -- in fact, we're not seeing that right now in Q1 and Q2. It's going to take a little bit of time. But the rollover and the change and the account-by-account is coming, and I'm getting monthly reports on how this is progressing and it is progressing according to our targets. So things are fine in there. It's not a question of region.", "As I said, we pragmatically, selectively deploy manpower when we have to deploy manpower. But there are 2 trends again. We are going to staff appropriately the way we need to in the places where we're growing. And I gave you examples of where we're growing, and we are doing absolutely fabulous in the regions where you would expect that we're doing fabulous, except that we also are doing pretty nice in -- and renewing with growth which didn't happen for a long time in the heritage Diversey, renewing with growth in the U.S. We had 2% -- over 2% growth in this quarter and this is serving us well. But we are double digits in Eastern European countries. We are growing very nicely, over 15% -- actually, 17% in China, 13% in India, in the currency as the same -- apples-with-apples with last year. We're growing in Turkey, very nicely. We're growing very well in Latin America, and you can guess that we are staffing properly in those regions. Unfortunately, more than -- almost half of our sales are in Western Europe, and that's life. So there, the industry is in very bad shape and we are, right now, suffering a little bit from some contracts which got lost under the previous administration. I can assure you that I am absolutely very, very pleased with the leadership, new leadership in that division and with the renewed energy and what we are going to be doing with the announcement of the plan that I have talked to you a few minutes ago and detailed by Carol; we are going to simplify this organization. We're going to de-lever this organization. We're going to make it more cost-efficient.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Punjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "On the management de-levering, as you put it, can you guys give us a rough sense as to how that breaks down geographically? And is it scaled generally by the size of the business or is it more concentrated? And, Carol, is the $65 million cash cost for the entirety of the program or just in 2013?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So Ghansham, in terms of breaking down, I'll provide a little more color. We're going to be a bit sensitive in terms of where some of the costs are going to be because obviously, a meaningful portion is related to severance costs. We estimate approximately 400 to 500 reduction in employees that is contained in that total program. The $65 million is related to 2013. The remaining $135 million, we would expect approximately $100 million of that to be incurred in 2014. I'll also note that the spend -- and we highlighted this in the 8-K that was filed today, includes -- the $180 million to $200 million includes $55 million to $70 million for capital expenditures associated with our supply chain network realignment to support our long-term strategic plan. We would expect, and this is included in the $65 million, somewhere around $10 million to $12 million for CapEx in 2013, and approximately $30 million to $35 million CapEx in 2014, with the remainder of it in the conclusion of the program. A larger portion will, in fact, be in Europe, as everyone would expect. Both the Food & Beverage and Institutional & Laundry businesses have a meaningful portion of the total program. I would say it's a little heavier for I&L than it is for F&B. So hopefully, that provides you some additional color.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, it's certainly helpful. And then, Jerome, as you think about various other cost buckets, how do you feel about your manufacturing capacity footprint globally as you look across the different businesses?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Very different, Ghansham, business-by-business. We are rationalizing in this program. We're going to be rationalizing also our footprint in some European countries, and especially some -- are tend to be global plant like -- or not, if not global, very large plants like in F&B. Some others would tend to be local plants because of the value add of less -- -- of more commoditized Protective Packaging products, for example. Though in some markets where we believe that the recovery is not there and close to come -- and I'm referring to Southern Europe -- we're going to be rationalizing our capacity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I had a question on your cash flow guidance. When I think about the legacy Sealed Air generating $300 million, $400 million of cash, I guess my question is, do you expect the I&L business to generate cash in 2013? Is it cash neutral or is it cash-dilutive, given some of the problems you're having in Europe? Or is there a way that we can think about kind of the long-term cash generation power of I&L, given maybe we have a little bit better understanding of what the packaging business has historically done?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So I'll -- just -- and then if Jerome wants to add comments. Just generally, we don't break out our cash flow separate for each of the segments. Obviously, you can look at historically based on what Sealed Air generated in the past and note that the I&L business does not contribute as much from a cash flow standpoint with restructuring charges. That obviously impacts the free cash flow for I&L, as well as F&B. The other thing to keep in mind is, we also have a lot of interest expense that is driven by the acquisition that affects the company overall. As I referenced in my comment, we have $290 million in cash interest costs that we will incur in 2013. So that's a big impact versus what you would have historically seen more recently for the legacy Sealed Air business prior to the Diversey acquisition. But we obviously expect I&L to be positive from an EBITDA standpoint for the full year, and positive EBITDA is positive cash flow.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "But by definition, Anthony, to be generating a lot of cash, you need to generate a lot of profits. And it's no mystery that I was fairly dissatisfied with the profits profile of this division, and that's why there are lots of changes being implemented. So bear with us a little bit of time and you'll be satisfied.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. I mean, you have some regions where you're kind of contracting and you have some regions where you're seeing impressive growth. When I think about the full year CapEx guidance of $160 million, is that a decent benchmark maybe going into 2014 in terms of some of the capital needs you have to take to expand or could that go up or maybe comes off a bit?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So we have set the bar fairly high for capital spending. We -- out of the $160 million at this minute, there is still some capital for IS [ph], and so as a result for restructuring and on the integration of companies. That's probably a number which is a little bit low, but it's all about prioritization. And the way I look at CapEx is that it is a resource similar to R&D. And if you ask me how do I look at R&D, I'm saying, probably a little bit too much, given our productivity at this minute. So -- and CapEx, probably a little bit too little given the opportunities that we have to expand in some parts of the world where -- and some product lines where -- which are going to be needing a little bit of capital. So if you take those 2 buckets as sources of -- as use of cash, I would suggest that those kind of things -- the sum of the 2 are probably not going to be growing very much next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to go back to the pricing actions that you're taking. You did mention that you're trying to offset the escalating raw materials costs. I guess my understanding was that most of these raws were already on passthrough mechanisms. So my first question is, can you just clarify on the passthrough mechanisms? And the second part of the question is really around, when do we -- do we need raw material prices to be flat in order to get real pricing for the value that you add for your customers? And also, if it's just based off of raw material prices, do we then end up giving some of that back when raw materials start to decline?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So first of all, with regards to our contracts, in North America, there are more contracts which have an escalator depending on raw materials, and then there is some which have a lag of several months. Some of too many months and some appropriately, but I don't think it is healthy to have contracts which have too much of a lag time. I do understand why they were there, but I'm not satisfied with those kinds of things. So this is one kind of situation. But some of the contracts, mostly in North America and some other parts of the world, it's a negotiation. And therefore, not automatically, but we're working -- I can assure you that we're making a lot of progress in there. Then the second is, okay, so you pass your costs. Is that where your ambition lies? And my ambition doesn't lie there. My ambition is twofold. One is to get that done by definition, what I was talking about, passing that by definition. Second is to get value for what we do and better value for what -- for the differentiation we create. Every single company has commodities and specialties. Every single company has products on which they fight on price on a daily basis and some others in which they need to find better on the value that they'll be creating. And in one of our core values, which is called purposeful innovation, and the word is the following, is, \"We delight our customers with revolutionary solutions which make them win, and we share the value that we have created.\" So it has several messages, #1 is that there is no room from me to innovation. We've got to really focus on real differentiated innovation. The second thing is that we have to ally with companies which look forward. Companies which really see that they need to differentiate or they need -- so if they differentiate, they have higher gross margins or if they can also differentiate by us enabling them to reduce their cost. But it can't be all for us because otherwise, they won't [ph] adopt those solutions or for them. So you can't -- you can't do those things with everybody. You've got to have cultural fit. And that -- these are the kind of discussions that I'm having with our customers. We are here to create value to them. We need to create value to us also. We have -- I'm deeply dissatisfied with our return on capital invested. I'm deeply dissatisfied with the technology that we have in relation to the margins, so we've got to -- we are working hard, and I can assure you that it resonates with some type of customers who really want us to help them differentiate. And that's where we're going to get the most value.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then the follow-up is just around, Carol, on the SARs expense, what's included in the guidance for the year, and then looking further out, when would we kind of expect these expenses to go away? Would the delayering in Europe help to reduce those costs in the future?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. So in terms of -- if some of the 400 to 500 that I referenced as part of the restructuring program, obviously, if any of those individuals have SARs, what would -- potentially the effect for their holdings would go away as part of their severance package, if that, in fact, happened. In terms of -- as long as they're outstanding, there will be volatility because they move with the value of the share price. The vesting of the 2.4 million units that I referenced, it has approximately 12 months longer to run to be fully vested. But again, we will have that volatility as we move forward. So in terms of what's included in our guidance, I guess we have not broken that out in the past. We do have an estimate in terms of cash flow and how that's impacted the liability that we have on the books, is approximately $40 million related to our SARs, but we haven't broken out previously the impact in the next month.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with Keybanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. One on cash flow, Carol. So you're planning to spend an additional $65 million on the cash restructuring compared to your previous guidance, but the range for the year only declined by $25 million so I'm just wondering what other moving parts are in there. Was working capital more beneficial than you expected or otherwise?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So, Adam, we're taking -- yes, we've made certain, I guess, assumptions relative to working capital, that it would be positive based on previous estimates that we had made and from a comparison standpoint. So if you look at our EBITDA, look at the midpoint of the guidance that we've provided and deduct from that, the cash interest of $290 million that I referenced, there's approximately $135 million for restructuring cash payments between the original integration and optimization program, as well as the $65 million for the new restructuring program, the $160 million for capital expenditures and then deferred taxes and potentially, what we may pay out in SARs. That would get you down to that new range that we're providing for the free cash flow, plus the improvement in working capital performance.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And, Jerome, one for you on pricing. How do you expect the nature and magnitude of your pricing initiatives to differ next year compared to this year?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "On -- as you heard me just say before to Scott, there was the 2 elements of this. Number one, the discipline, and I don't know; I don't want to anticipate what polyolefin or other related raw materials are going to be. And the other one, it is depending on our innovation and on our culture. I am expecting our people to be more forceful at getting value from the services that they provide today and don't get value on today. If you want one example, we're engineering plants for some of our customers because we are a big equipment manufacturer and seller. While there are -- one can pretend that engineering is included in some of the prices for our equipment for fumes, et cetera, et cetera, or not. But I want a more rigorous approach. Again, this company can do better. That's my view.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So first question, Carol, you talked about potentially monetizing nonstrategic assets. Obviously, you had the Diversey Japan transaction, but just wondering how you're thinking about that. Is the target still $500 million or, as a result of this increased restructuring program, might you guys get more aggressive on this front?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So the -- we have not set any new target, Phil. Previous communication was that it could be up to $500 million as we continue to look at the assets, the portfolios, different regions. We'll review that number as we go forward. We've also been very clear that we're not looking to have a fire sale on anything. We want to approach this very disciplined and we have to get the right valuation. But I guess the message we want everyone to take away today is that we are committed to reducing the leverage for the company and we're going to be very prudent in terms of making sure we can fund these restructuring programs, and we'll look to move forward on certain assets. But I guess I wouldn't feel comfortable targeting a certain amount right now because we also -- we're not going to walk away from something that's adding value to the business if we can't get the right valuation for it. We will then look to potentially slow down the timing of some of the cash outflow relative to the restructuring cost to make sure we have a proper balance.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 1 follow-up question on pricing. Sorry if we're beating a dead horse here, but I guess, just asking a slightly different way, to what extent does the competitive response kind of impact, Jerome, how you might think about the pricing initiatives? You gave the example of Protective, so just more broadly, if you were to start to see that in other areas, between pricing versus restructuring, et cetera, maybe just how you think about that.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "The way I think about that is that I don't care very much what our competitors are doing. The reason why I'm saying this is that, as I said before, there are some product lines of which I am deeply dissatisfied with the return on capital invested. Those don't return capital. If our competitors want to destroy economic value, that's their problem; no problem for me. What I want is that we, in a disciplined way, move to the targets that we have. And they include getting a proper return on capital investment on some of that. So in some product lines, we are seeing that we're alone. Fine. At the end of the day, a product line which has a low EBITDA, it has a low EBITDA because we haven't done our homework, because it has commoditized, et cetera, et cetera, or -- well, it's either/or. And \"we haven't done our homework\" means -- can be on differentiation, can be on being forceful, not forceful enough on our pricing discipline, et cetera, or because it's a dud. Well, in that case, you select the type of customers you want to work with, you select those who value your differentiation, your brand, your portfolio, et cetera, and then fine. And those who just go for volume, well, let them go for volume. I -- this company is more focused than it was in the past on value versus volume. And I don't want to make it into an obsession, I probably have talked much too much about all of this, but this is internally, a very clear message.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Jerome, I know you've been digging through the packaging businesses for a while now just to kind of figure out where the real value is. Can you give us your thoughts on how much of your packaging-related portfolio is either truly specialty or has kind of a lock and key type system to it, and how much of it might be viewed as more commodity?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, again, you've got to look at this division by division. And in some of our divisions, the name is a warranty for a certain quality. If I would take our most iconic brand, which is Bubble Wrap, you can have plastics encapsulated bubbles -- or bubbles encapsulated in plastics films, et cetera, from wherever you want. And our people have led me to understand that bubble wrap is not Bubble Wrap. That you've got Bubble Wrap and that you've got generic Bubble Wrap and that you can't compare because they deflate, they do this, they do this, et cetera, et cetera. So some products are heavily commoditized. Some others, not. Some product lines, people think that they are but they're not. In some, the brand equity is very large. So I can't embark into taking a one-on-one every single division and every single product line and tell you this is a commodity because there are shades of gray. You have products which are clear commodities. I would call synth foam [ph] a clear commodity. And then next to that, you have products which are -- which still have brand equity but are less differentiated than they were in the past. And then you have some products, which are clearly second to none, and they are unmatched. We are growing the category in Food Packaging, we have lots of those things in Protective Packaging. We have some Fill-Air lines and in shrink packaging, we have an extraordinary differentiated product which is making a killing right now. And our shrink film business has been a commodity business and is going to move, I can assure you, over the next 3 years into a very strong specialty. And the value proposition that we bring to our customers here is that we are having 25% to 50% less gauge at equal performance and equal clarity. So these are the kind of shrink film for consumer goods. You take 2 bottles of shampoo then bundle them in their shrink film, and I can assure you that there is a lot of value for our customers and a lot of value for ourselves.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one last question. In I&L, you announced a pretty big contract win last quarter. Are you fully staffed for the service needed on those contracts yet or is there still more kind of cost to be laid in just to at least meet that contract, specifically?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "We are, and I don't know -- we have hired a few people here and there, but I don't know whether we have hired everyone we wanted to hire by now, et cetera. Those kind of contracts are ramp-up phasing -- on a ramp-up phase; they take a little bit of time to implement. And as a result of that, it's work in progress. But as I said earlier, I am satisfied, I'm following that up closely, just like you can imagine that I'm following up the win and the losses here and there. I'm satisfied with the ratio and -- but I'm very dissatisfied with what's happening in Western Europe and our exposure to Southern Europe. I do understand what's going on. I am dissatisfied because I would like to have better growth. We're having fabulous growth in some places but -- and not in Southern Europe as a result of some heritage business losses, which I can assure you would not happen today. And also, because the market sucks in some of those countries. As a Frenchman, I can tell you, I'm very concerned about the French economy. It's been moving towards Spain and Italy instead of moving towards Germany. And it shows in our equipment business, equipment and tools business. People who can make their big tacky machine run a little bit longer, they're just going to do it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I know Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for you for I&L. I just want to get a sense, going forward for better pricing, how should we think about the profitability of this business from a cadence standpoint in the next few quarters?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "A work in progress. It is a -- those things don't get turned around on a quarterly basis. What I can assure you is that there is a lot of energy, a lot of energy in this business. We have growth in our 2013 plan and we're going to make it happen, and I'm very encouraged by some of those things, and I'm not going to come back on what I've just said a second ago, but I do not expect much improvement in Western Europe in the very short term. Having said that, we're having some fabulous success stories here and there in some emerging markets and we're seeing growth in North America, which was not the case 12 months ago. So all of this is moving in the right direction. And I know that with what we're doing, it's going to get better. Give me a little bit of time. Give Ilham a little bit of time.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then, I guess, a question for Carol. What's the long-term net leverage target, including price, that you're talking about over long-term before -- the focus is obviously debt pay-down now, but what's the target you want reached before -- would open the door for you to be a bit more strategic on the cash flow?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. So what we communicated is we definitely want to get under 4x. We're going to take a step back and look at what's going on from a macroeconomic standpoint, where we're at with cash flow generation, what are the strategic priorities of the company, but definitely, some -- moving towards that 3.5x to 4x and then reassessing. We want to make sure we're always prudent in our capital management for the company. So it will be fluid, but you can rest assured there is a commitment from this management team to reduce the leverage.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "#1, #2, #3 priority is to de-leverage this company. And that's going to keep us busy for the next 12 months. And then depending on the world economy, we're going to be satisfied with a given ratio, which is going to be a higher ratio if the economy looks really on the right track, and we're going to keep on if it really looks iffy.", "Operator", "And this is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Peribere, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing remarks.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "All right. Well, thank you all for your questions, and thank you for being here with us in announcing these first quarter results. In closing, as we have communicated, the process of transforming Sealed Air is going to take time, but I am pleased with what I said. I started this call by telling you some of all the very great things that we're doing. We're doing many, many, many things at the very same time, and actually, I am proud of the energy that I'm seeing from our leadership, but also from all of our employees who are seeing this project and believe in that project. So this is great. We have a clear direction and we have -- are determined to see the stop of the declining margins this year and starting to grow it again. To our new earnings quality improvement program that we have announced, we'll begin the alignment of our cost structure and footprint with the growth and profit strategy of the company. And we are in the process of becoming a more nimble, focused company that delights our customers. This is why we exist. And I look forward to leading our employees who are creating a better way for life, which is our new vision, while providing value to our shareholders. Thank you very much. Have a good day. We'll have another earnings call before our Investor Day on September 20, and I look forward to being able to explain to you and show you our senior management in action, talking to you about our midterm strategy on September 20.

And good morning to everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter financial results and operational performance across a number of key metrics. Before I get into the detailed results, I think it is important to mention that I have been at Sealed Air for 11 months exactly now, and the change from where we were when I got here to where we are today is night and day.", "Our second quarter performance is a true testament to the progress we have made, and our employees are engaged, and I want to thank all 25,000 of them for their commitment.

On Slide #2, we highlight our top line and adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter. Sales were up 1.9% on an as-reported basis and up 3.2% on a constant currency basis. All our divisions reported net sales growth on a year-over-year basis despite the continued challenge in the macroeconomy.", "Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.1% increased 27%, excluding the impact of stock appreciation rights, or SARs. The increase in EBITDA was driven by margin expansion in both our Food & Beverage and Institutional & Laundry divisions. We are seeing the benefits of operational improvement programs across the organization, which include manufacturing efficiencies, cost containment and synergies.", "On the pricing front, we are making progress in the marketplace in each of the divisions, and we'll discuss these initiatives later in the call.", "Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the top line results by region. We continue to see solid growth in Latin America, where we achieved 12% constant dollar sales growth; and in AMAT, standing for Asia, Mid East, Africa and Turkey, where we had 11% constant sales growth. The growth in regions in total increased 9% and accounted for approximately 26% of our total sales.", "The team is doing a great job penetrating the marketplace and growing our business with existing customers in addition to building a new customer base locally. Brazil, Turkey and China delivered double-digit sales growth on a constant currency basis. While we had strong growth in China in the first half of the year, we are closely monitoring the economy, as recent trends have indicated some deceleration.", "In North America, we increased sales 2% with low single-digit growth in the United States and almost 9% growth in Canada. In Europe, where our business is being impacted by weak economies, sales were essentially flat on a constant currency basis. To be more specific, Germany and the U.K. have increased modestly, but France was down in the high single digits and Italy was down by more than 10%. These 4 countries combined make up approximately 15% of our total sales.", "And in Japan and ANZ, where sales were slightly down, Australia was flat and New Zealand declined by almost 10% due to weakness, particularly in the Food & Beverage division, mostly from drought and its impact on the dairy market.", "Turning to Slide 4 and moving to the businesses. Food & Beverage sales increased 4% on a constant dollar basis. Regionally, we continued to experience above-market growth in AMAT and in Latin America, where we benefit from not only rising beef production prices but also our breadth of innovative solution -- product and sanitation solutions in Food & Beverage.", "Constant currency sales increased 18% in AMAT and 13% in Latin America. China increased by more than 30%. Africa was up 8%, and Brazil was up 13%. In Argentina, we achieved 35% constant currency growth, or 15% on an as-reported basis.", "In North America and Europe, our more mature markets, where we are currently in a down cycle for beef production, our growth is driven by our ability to provide our customers with value-added services and new applications. Examples of value-added services include helping our currency -- our customers minimize operations downtime and increase automation. Examples of new applications include those for fresh red meat, such as Darfresh, Grip & Tear, Simple Steps and Oven Ease. These innovative applications are driving stronger equipment sales and a more favorable product mix.", "So while beef production in North America increased approximately 1% and Europe declined by approximately 1%, we increased sales in North America by just over 2%, and Europe was relatively flat. Constant currency sales increased 12% in Germany and 5% in the U.K. but were offset by continued economic weakness in France, Italy and Spain.", "I want to briefly highlight the progress remaining on our new -- we're making on our new pricing discipline and the EBITDA margin performance that F&B delivered in the quarter. EBITDA margins increased to 14.7% from 11.9% last year, excluding the impact of SARs. The margin expansion was primarily driven by a more favorable product mix, higher volume and onetime manufacturing costs included in 2012. Our new pricing discipline in F&B is progressing, but it is still a work in progress, as we have some customers on formula.", "As we have discussed for many months now, our sales efforts are focused on bringing value-added solutions to our customers and selling higher-performance products, such as the products I previously mentioned. We remain steadfast on our commitment to more than recover material costs.", "Slide 5 highlights the results from our Institutional & Laundry division. I&L net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3%. In Q2, we saw strong growth across most countries and sectors in AMAT and Latin America, resulting in double-digit constant currency sales growth. India increased 13%, and Turkey, Brazil and China grew approximately 8% to 9%. Argentina performed well, with constant currency growth of 35% or 15% on a reported basis.", "In North America, we were pleased to see another quarter with positive volume growth. This was due to the combination of new customer wins in health care, increased building care chemical sales in the retail sector and the product launch of our floor care equipments.", "In Europe, which accounts for almost half of the I&L sales, we reported a 1.2% decline in constant currency, which was slightly better than recent quarters. And our business is still challenged in Southern Europe, which declined in the mid-single-digit range, but this decline was partially offset by positive trends in Eastern Europe.", "Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 12.4% from 9.6% last year, excluding the impact of SARs, and the key driver behind the margin expansion was increased sales and cost containment and synergies. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be a seasonally very strong quarter for us. And given the fixed cost structure of this division, which is heavy manpower intensive, you can see the leverage.", "Turning now to Slide 6, our Protective Packaging division delivered a 0.9% increase in sales on a reported basis and an increase of nearly 2% on a constant dollar basis. From a regional perspective, sales in North America increased approximately 3%, partially offset by a slight decline in Europe. Sales in the U.K., Germany and Italy were flat to up 1%, while France, again, declined by more than 10%. Not surprisingly, this business is highly sensitive to the global industrial economy, and we experienced decelerating trends throughout the quarter. In the U.S., we had unfavorable product mix with continuous growth in e-commerce and retail and also suffered from distribution destocking inventory.", "We held firm on price and walked away from low-quality businesses, particularly in Europe. And on a global basis, we are getting better pricing across the full product portfolio. And as a result, gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to last year. While this is encouraging, gross margins did not improve enough to offset increased expenses. And we're making some progress on price, but there's still some work to do.", "And now I will turn the call over to Carol to further discuss our second quarter financial results and highlight our outlook for the remainder of 2013.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along with our presentation, Slide 7 provides a bridge for the 2% year-over-year net sales growth. Volumes contributed $46 million. Price/mix was $15 million positive, driven by favorable trends in F&B and I&L. Currency translation was $23 million unfavorable, primarily driven by declines in Latin American currency.", "Slide 8 reflects the adjusted EBITDA bridge from second quarter 2012 to second quarter 2013. Volume contributed $18 million and mix & price/cost spread contributed $4 million to the improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Cost synergies were $20 million in the quarter. The favorable $17 million for SG&A and other includes approximately $9 million related to the net impact of plant consolidations and relocation projects in the Food & Beverage division that negatively impacted results in the second quarter 2012, as Jerome previously mentioned.", "SARs expense was immaterial this quarter, but in the second quarter last year, SARs was actually $9 million positive. While the amount of SARs expense is not linear with the change in the value of Sealed Air stock price, based on the current number of SARs outstanding, we estimate that every $1 change in our stock price impacts EBITDA by approximately $2 million. As of the end of June, we had $1.9 million SARs outstanding. Obviously, as this number of outstanding changes, so does the impact on EBITDA.", "Now turning to Slide 9. In the 6 months ending June 30, free cash flow was a source of $12 million. This was a $140 million improvement over the first 6 months of 2012. The significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to higher net earnings and lower CapEx. CapEx in the first 6 months of 2013 was $51 million compared to $66 million for the same period a year ago. Our primary use for free cash flow generation remains focused on reducing leverage.", "Our outlook for the remainder of 2013 is summarized on Slide 10. We're maintaining our full year 2013 net sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA is tracking toward the high end of the guidance we previously provided of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion. We are also tracking toward the high end of our previously forecasted range for earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.20.", "We continue to expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which compares with $280 million for the year ended 2012.", "This may see modest given our performance in the first half. However, we still expect capital expenditures to be $160 million and cash restructuring to be $135 million for the full year 2013, and both of those spends are more heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. We are also assuming higher cash SARs payments in 2013 than in 2012.", "Our core tax rate for the second quarter 2013 was 23.8%. This compares with 27.1% for the second quarter last year. We expect our core tax rate to be approximately 25% for the full year. Interest expense for this year, full year, is expected to be approximately $355 million. This includes $290 million of cash interest expense.", "Before turning the call back to Jerome to lead the Q&A, I'd like to note that we've included, in the appendix of the presentation, a summary of our second quarter adjusted earnings per share calculation. We believe you'll find this schedule useful to understand the math as you move from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted earnings per share. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to remind you that our Analyst Day will be held on September 20 in New York City. It will be a half-day event starting at 8:00 a.m. at the Sofitel Hotel. The Sealed Air leadership team will present to you a review of each of our divisions, provide a mid-term outlook and share our strategic priorities, outlining our long-term goals.", "Operator, I'd like to open up the call for any questions from the participants.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Margin in I&L was a little stronger than we would have expected. It looks like the synergy's really flowing through during the quarter, and volumes obviously helped. But how should we be thinking about the cadence of the margins in the coming quarters? And should we expect synergies to pick up a little bit here? And I do understand there's some seasonality with the business.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you. Yes, we -- I mean, we had good leverage. We've communicated previously that this business does have a fixed -- high fixed cost structure because it's very service intensive. Also, as Jerome noted, our second quarter is very seasonally strong. And because of that, you do see the benefit of that leverage we talk about. We also had the benefit of cost savings that have helped partially offset inflationary costs. However, with that, there is some caution related to the economy, Europe, China deceleration. Jerome highlighted that France has been down significantly. Tourism in France is down 10%. You've got the issues in Turkey with Taksim Square, and everyone is well aware of what's going on in Egypt. And a lot of this business, especially through the summer months, is driven by tourism. So based on that and the fact that we've also highlighted, while we're working on our new earnings quality improvement program, and that will benefit the Institutional & Laundry business, especially beginning in 2014, we won't see any savings from the earnings quality improvement program for them for 2013 because we have to go to a lot of works councils and have those negotiations. So we feel really good about the performance for I&L. But because of some of the headwinds at a top line basis, we feel like we need to be modest as we look towards the balance of the year.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So should we expect margins to step down a little bit in Q3?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Well, I guess, we don't really provide margin guidance by any of the divisions specifically. We provide EBITDA for full year, but we don't give margins.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And then on pricing for across the board, it seems like a little stronger than expected. But if you look at F&B, your margins were kind of in line with expectations. When should we really start seeing real net pricing? I guess it's more of a 2014 event, but can you kind of endcap what the leverage -- that could be going down the road?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So we are seeing a very good effect already on our margin because pricing has 2 components. One thing is the raw materials that you pass or you don't, and this also depends on how strong we are seeing those materials go up. We have seen also margin expansion. So this is, for us, the important thing. And it is, of course, not across the board and not across the regions. Let me start with the bad news. We're seeing it, for example, in F&B that in Western Europe, our pricing margin expansion has been -- has not been good because the situation is extremely difficult there. But we've seen, selectively, some good progress in some specific countries and very good results, also, on low-margin products. But when we don't have pricing success, we're going back, and this is across the board. What I just mentioned here was F&B. In North America, we're seeing progress in there, again, selectively. But we're seeing that we have had some selective progress there because, on some product lines, we have quite a lot of business on formula. And the formulas are starting to kick in since May and June, depending on the product line. Some other regions have been showing very nice growth in pricing, for example, in Latin America, where we've seen substantial progress on our pricing actions and such. On Protective Packaging, we have not pushed sales because we voluntarily went out of some product lines or some products where we had low margins. So when we look at the sales growth in Q2 of our Protective Packaging business, we have -- I'm actually not looking at it very much because I have pushed our people to show determination in our pricing situation. So this is what we have observed as a result of this: we have had some sales down in Europe, but we have seen also some nice margin expansions because of our initiatives.", "Operator", "And your next question comes in the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to circle up on the I&L business. And to what degree do you think the -- that price/cost spread that you saw in the second quarter is -- of $5 million is sustainable throughout the remainder of the year?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So Al, as the -- it sort of goes along with the comments that I provided just on the first question. We do expect that we will continue to see improved performance in I&L as we move forward based on a lot of changes that are happening -- taking place, and the year-over-year comps will be favorable from that standpoint in terms of some of the challenges that were faced in the prior year. But again, we do have some slight caution because this business is so driven by top line because of that cost structure. So it's going to be very dependent on the sales and what they maintain for the balance of the year, and there are some concerns out there with what's going on in Western Europe.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "The -- let me add a little bit of flavor here. Number one, you know the seasonality of this business, which is heavily loaded towards Q2. Second, we are going to be slightly negatively impacted by our -- by the change in currency and by a few selective events in countries, which are important to us. The -- Turkey is an important country, and what we have seen is that as the events were developing in June on Taksim square, we had our customers load some business -- or load some product in order to prevent any disruption. And as a result -- and what we have seen also is that the tourism in Istanbul and in some parts of Turkey has suffered since then from some quite a few cancellations. We have seen the same events or situation in Egypt where our month of June has been strong in anticipation for preventing product delivery disruptions. And I don't know to which extent you know that, but tourism right now in Egypt is a complete disaster. And in Western Europe, the season is not very good because of all the Latin countries are actually doing very poorly in this kind of business altogether. So I think that we've got to take things as they are. We're very pleased with the initiatives that Ilham has taken, very pleased. She has announced just 2 weeks ago, internally, a reorganization of her business, and this organization is around simplifying it in order to ensure clarity, simplicity and affordability. We are going to see, over time, the benefits of these initiatives. And she's taking out, also, bleeders. And this is going to have an impact on our top line, but over time, a positive impact on our bottom line.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. That's helpful. Just -- and the follow-up question is you highlighted conservatism on some of these -- the items you noted. Can you just tell or talk to us about how July volume trends are going across each of the segments so far?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, we just don't give guidance specifically. But I gave you a flavor on the I&L business, which is in there. And overall, we are -- well, again, I don't want to give specific guidance to -- onto Q2. But the seasonality is in there, and we have a slight currency impact for the second half of the year. We believe that this might have -- that these currencies stay at level where they are, this is going to have about a $10 million negative impact on the second half of the year. So when you do $1 million -- $1 billion of EBITDA, you have 1% which is just one-off there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.", "Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just on Protective Packaging, you talked about walking away from some business there, as well as just some of the price progress you're looking to make. I guess what I was wondering was, there are some headwinds on the SG&A, et cetera. So I was wondering how you're thinking about some of the cost containment initiatives and the potential around those as we progress through the rest of the year.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So we are -- yes, we had slightly higher expenses in Protective Packaging, and the reason is that we are investing in one specific segment, which is the e-commerce segment. That's one. We are, on the other side, taking notice of the clear trends with regards to Europe. We are reorganizing our business in Europe and taking cost out once again. Given the labor unions, given the overall work environment, we -- this takes a little bit of time. But that's for the expense part. With regards to the pricing, we have -- we determined we are moving from some of our -- we're moving from some of our product lines with determination here. We're seeing more price actions across the whole portfolio that we have seen in a very long time. And we're implementing more price increase in the second half to address the raw material inflation and the lag that we have had in our pricing in the first half. Note to note, still work to do. But overall, we are very clear with where we want to go in this. This is an industry, which is fairly undisciplined, but we're doing what we have to do. We have lost some accounts. In some of our polyurethanes business, we have lost some accounts. And on shrink film, also, we have implemented our price increases. We lost some accounts, but -- and in some cases, we have not recovered our cost increases, and we'll go back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes in the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Jerome, still trying to figure out Protective Packaging. Because it sounds like you walked away from some business, but volumes were still very, very good in the context of some of the broader economic weakness that a lot of the peer group has called out during the quarter. I know that the international markets were quite strong for that business. So can you help us understand what exactly is happening? I know you called out e-commerce, et cetera. But how does the margin profile for the international portion of that business compare to the North American portion?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So in -- first of all, the segments, we are -- we are more selective than we were in the past. And you know that I want to change the profile of those businesses. Traditionally, the e-commerce business is very price driven and, generally speaking, slightly lower-margin business. That is our existing business. I will take that business towards more value add through systems because we have lots of technologies, which can add tremendous value to the fulfillment operations of our customers and 3PL. But our mailers business, our bubble business, et cetera, are traditionally low-margin businesses there. In Europe, we've seen a lot of weakness. The auto industry has been extremely weak, and the auto industry, for us, was traditionally -- is traditionally a strong, high-value type of business because there's a lot of cushioning there. May has been very weak. June has been a little bit better in Europe, but the economies are what -- you know what they are. In our shrink business, we're making a lot of progress because we are much more selective in our customer approach, and we have new technologies, and we intend to extract the value of those businesses. Our general use business, which is our packaging systems, where there is equipment and where there -- and where we have Fill-Air type of products, it's been doing quite well in North America, in the U.S. Our sales there have been going 5% up, which is pretty good. But as I said before, we are more selective because I'm determined to take this business to higher-quality businesses.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And just in terms of Institutional & Laundry, just as a clarification, where you basically saying that a portion of that business benefited from a prebuy based on the events in Turkey and Egypt? And can you sort of put some financial parameters around that?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you. What we have seen is, in some of those countries, we've seen a little bit of this, which is very understandable because of what -- of the people not knowing and the businesses not knowing how the events were going to be developing. So you've got some -- but these are selective. What we think is that in China, there's been -- there's not been prebuying. But what was clearly double digits -- we've got pretty nice I&L growth in Asia, but the difference is that, that growth has gone -- has decelerated in a country like China, for example. But it was nice. If I remember well, it was 17% in the first quarter, and we were at about 9% in the second quarter. We had some great parts. India has been doing very nice. Africa has been doing very well. But as I said, the pace in China has been slightly lower in I&L.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alax Wang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sitting in for George Staphos today. Can you just talk about maybe your learnings from recent awards for Diversey, maybe more specifically what field area is doing well and what needs to be done better?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, I think what we've been doing well is that we have reorganized this business to simplify it. It was a little bit convoluted, and Ilham Kadri has announced her reorganization, as I said, 2 weeks ago. That's one. Number two, she has been addressing, very seriously, our bleeders. And therefore, we are -- there are some businesses, which were -- or some customers, which are -- were having absolutely unacceptable returns. And we're just walking away from those kind of businesses. We're not renewing them. We are, every time, negotiating our contracts in a better way than we were before. So all of this goes to clarity, it goes to affordability, and it goes to simplification. And all of this is going to be work in progress.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Jerome, just wanted to talk about I&L here for a minute. You mentioned, in the slides, new customer wins and account penetration in Latin America and AMAT. I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more color, first, on the new customer wins, what market segments that's coming from, whether that's retail, lodging, health care, et cetera. And can you talk a little bit more about this account penetration -- I'm assuming that's existing accounts, sort of how that's progressing? Is that -- I remember you added sales people in order to do that. Is that -- is this the beginning of that program? And how much longer can we see some benefits from that?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So we are -- we're keeping a track on our customer wins and customer losses, et cetera. And let me assure you that we're very happy about that. And of course, customer wins and losses, you get them from and to everyone in the industry. Our -- in North America, our new customer wins are specifically in health care and increased building care chemical sales in the retail business. We also have been launching -- you know that our TASKI machines were mostly European based. You know that we have suffered because of lack of investments in our customer base in Europe. We have suffered from lowering sales in that part of the world. Well, it's the opposite in U.S. because we have launched those machines last year, and we're seeing a very, very good pickup. Those equipment are superior equipment compared to what is existing in the industry. And when I say superior is that those equipments are -- but I would say they are Swiss made. They are Swiss made. But they are very, very high quality with very low maintenance cost, with lower water and longer battery life than our competitors. And our customer -- it's a great value proposition for our customers. So we're having very nice momentum and regaining traction on this business, which is having growth. In the European markets, we are having some nice customer wins. Every time we're taking this, these customers, we're taking them at higher margins. We -- having single-digit EBITDA in this business is clearly, clearly unacceptable. So every single contract that we're taking is at higher margins. You don't take -- you renew contracts on the 3-year or 5-years basis, et cetera, and we are working on this. And our value proposition is about the value created to our customers. It is not about the fee base. It is not about those kind of things. And that's the way we're tackling this business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Couple -- I had 2 questions for you, 1 on cash flow, 1 on the pricing initiatives you've undertaken. First, on the pricing initiatives. Recognizing, as you just said, that some of these are couple-of-year contracts, and aside from the adjustments that are happening mechanically, the up and down materials pieces, if you're in the process of going through and raising prices, could you handicap or maybe give us a sense of where you are in the process? What portion of your contracts have you been able to address or portion of your portfolio have you been able to address? And has there been any response in the -- from the competitive landscape thus far?", "[indiscernible]", "Jerome A. Peribere", "We're -- it's difficult to answer your question, Chris, because we have 3 very different businesses. We have a Food business, which itself is about hygiene and sanitation, with contracts, which are on 3 to 5 years. Then, we have Packaging, food packaging business, which is on -- some of which is on pricing formulas, some of which is negotiated. And then we have the Diversey I&L business, which is also contracts, and I already talked about this. What I want to assure you about is that, as quoted by the financial leader of the Protective Packaging division 2 days ago when we were reviewing our July S&OP, there is -- there's never been as much attention and push towards improving the quality of our business through margin expansion. We saw 20 basis points. Am I happy with 20 basis points at the gross profit level absolute improvement? Absolutely not. But this was an organization, which was looking at volume. It was almost forbidden to lose an order. That is not the case anymore. We are -- we have some bleeders, as I said. We have some product lines, which are, by far, not getting the return on capital invested, and we are working on those. So you have some price formulas. They are going to be favorable to us unless our polyethylene supply has jacked up the price again in the rest of the year. But we should recoup some of that in margins later in the year in the -- hopefully, in the third quarter. The -- some of these are just negotiations. When we have negotiations, our people are, by definition, seeing resistance. I've never seen a purchaser tell me that our products are too cheap. But they understand because it's not only about price. It is about quality. It is about the value we create to them, et cetera. So this is -- there's a cultural shift. It is going to take time, but we are seeing some good attention and movements.", "Carol P. Lowe", "But Chris, you had a question also on cash flow?", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My follow-up question was just regarding cash flows. As we look at this year, you talked about $135 million of cash out for restructuring, $160 million of CapEx. As these programs wind down, maybe could you talk to us a little bit about -- I recognize you're probably going to give more of this on your Analyst Day in a few weeks, but how that looks the next couple of years? Are you largely done restructuring at this point? Will that -- some of that continue in the next -- maybe the direction of each of those the next couple of years?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. So we had announced 2 programs. One was the original Integration and Optimization Program that was part of the Diversey acquisition. That program, the total cash cost was provided at $235 million, $70 million of which we will have this year. That makes up part of that total $135 million. The savings for that total program is $195 million to $200 million. We've indicated that we would expect to have approximately $90 million in savings for the full year 2013. That program is largely done at the end of this year. The new earnings quality improvement program that we announced with our first quarter earnings call, the total cost of that program was in the range of $180 million to $200 million with total savings of about $80 million by the end of 2015. The cash cost for 2013, $65 million. Savings that we will realize in 2013 are 0 to negligible, largely because the biggest portion of this new program is related to Europe and getting our cost structure correct there across all 3 of the primary businesses. So we'll reach that run rate of $80 million by the end of 2015. If you want to look at that $80 million, you would say slightly more than half should be realized in 2014. We don't, right now, have additional programs. We have indicated, it's not our intent to be a serial restructurer. We want to get a steady-state business and then focus on improvement of the business each and every day. However, it doesn't mean if we don't have large opportunities and meaningful opportunities to improve the cost structure for the business that we won't take advantage of them.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "A quick one here, a quick add-up here. We -- on our CapEx of $160 million, we have been prudent. We didn't know at the beginning of the year how the year was going to unfold. So the instructions that Carol and I gave were extremely clear: we'll go slow into our spending because what is spent is spent. So we've been very slow in the first half on our capital spending. And as a result of that, because we have to do what we have to do in our plans, we are going to be spending more in the second half. And this is why -- this is one of the main reasons, other than the ones Carol talked to you about, for not increasing our guidance in our cash flow for the total year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I know you guys don't like to provide guidance, but since these are new segments, can you give us just some kind of ballpark for how you think about margins in each of these segments if we look out 3 to 5 years?", "Carol P. Lowe", "We'll -- Mark, we will have more color when we have our Investor Day. That's when we'll have a little more detail by division. So we look forward to seeing you in September.", "Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, I'll -- we'll wait for that. Then I just wondered, as a follow-on, Jerome, it sounds like your view of the second half is that your biggest challenges are still uncertainty around volume. Can you just confirm that?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Yes. Well, seasonality, I'm looking at -- I can imagine that many of you are saying, \"This is being sandbagged, and those guys have $0.35 and they're sandbagging the second half.\" No, we want to be credible. I would summarize by saying we've got $10 million. Unless the dollar devalues, we've got $10 million of the EBITDA level here to take into account because of change of currency. We've got seasonality. We've got some few here -- things here and there on the I&L business because of the countries I talked to you about. And this economy is not strong. I was listening to NPR this morning in the car going -- coming to the office, and somebody was making the comment, saying that we are in the fourth year of the recovery, and it doesn't feel like a recovery because it's the first time ever that things, 4 years within the recovery, are feeling so iffy. So when -- our protective business is heavily dependent -- we're talking about 15% to 20% being on e-commerce. It means that 80% to 85% is based on industry. Well, industry is not doing well, and we're seeing that in our Protective Packaging in China, for example. It's not doing well. And we do have a few nice spots, but we've got to be reasonable here. And when I look at our EBITDA in the first half, and when I look at how we've been doing as a percentage of our total EBITDA or our total sales in the first half compared to the second half from a historical perspective, I'm reinforcing the guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The Food & Beverage segment, of course, saw a very meaningful $27 million improvement in EBITDA year-over-year. Would you be able to help us parse that out and talk about how much of the EBITDA improvement was in the hygiene subsegment and how much was in the packaging solutions subsegment?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes. We've provided the information at the top line in terms of the sales piece of it, but we're not breaking out the EBITDA between those 2 components. Proportionately, the food packaging side of it is much larger than the hygiene piece of it, so we would see more impact from what happens within that business.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "And having said that, we are -- our star region is AMAT and Latin America in that respect. Our hygiene business is kicking butt there, and we're doing really well.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. Maybe if I could just ask the question slightly differently. Just historically, what was the normal margin on that hygiene piece of the business on historical -- on the historical basis? Can you just comment on that?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Mid-single digit.", "Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Mid-single digit, okay. And then just last question for me on -- is there any update from you on the W.R. Grace situation?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes, so just a quick update. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, they held -- heard oral arguments on June 17 on the -- there's 5 pending appeals. On July 24, the court entered an opinion and judgment relating to Garlock's appeal, and they affirmed the District Court's decision, and they overruled Garlock on the settlement plan. The court has yet to rule on the other outstanding appeals. We don't know when the Third Circuit Court may or may not rule on those, so we are kind of wait and see until that happens.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Jerome, perhaps you plan to address this at the Investor Day, but where do you expect most of your longer-term margin improvement to come from: pricing in excess of cost inflation, ridding yourself of unprofitable business, cost reductions, volume growth or some combination of the above? And which do you think will be the biggest factor or 2 factors? I know some of these might go hand in hand, but I just wanted to hear how you think about the issue.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "You answered. You answered, Adam. I am determined to lead this company towards a higher-quality company. As I said several times, this company is going to be -- is going to have a 16% EBITDA level before it gets -- it becomes a $10 billion company. And I -- for this, we need to change the culture of this organization. We need to make people more hungry to gain quality business, more selective. We need to accept that there's some product lines, which have aged and that we are not interested in. So this is why you have seen our productivity ratio of expense to gross profit be so front and center here. Commodities can have a good return, provided they utilize less resources than other product lines. So it's going to come from moving this company towards a simpler, less structured, more efficient and more accountable organization. And for the details, you're welcome in New York at the Sofitel Hotel on the morning of September 20.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "One thing we -- coming to the release this morning, there were 2 items that you called out as unusual that totaled $10.8 million. $3.5 million was on cost of sales, $7.3 million was on SG&A. And in the write-up, you said $5.5 million of that $10.8 million was a write-down in the other segment. But that leaves you with $5.3 million, and we have no idea how that would be split among the segments.", "Carol P. Lowe", "So -- yes. Chip, we may -- to do the math of that, we maybe ought to take it offline. With respect to the other segment, that write-down, it wasn't specific to the medical business. It was some R&D type product lines that the company had been testing for several years, and we just didn't feel like we were going to reach the growth or margin levels that we would find acceptable. So we had some asset investments that we wrote off, and that's the piece that you're seeing for the medical and other. But again, I'd like to reiterate, it has nothing to do with the medical business specifically [indiscernible]", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, most of that other is tied to, I guess, the -- both programs, the QIP and the Integration and Optimization Program. But as you take charges and then -- but you have a separate line for costs. And I understood that you would take the charge, and then the cost would not flow through the P&L since they're on the charges. Why would they be separate? I'm just curious. Is this because things come up that you incur on a current basis that aren't part of prior charges? Or maybe you could help us there.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes. Chip, I guess it's going to be a lot of detail to walk through all of the numbers, so maybe we would take that offline. But I guess, we're not -- I'm not sure I understand what you're saying about other versus the restructuring. We clearly call out what are the restructuring pieces and how they impact. We actually have a reconciliation within the attachments to the earnings release. And those Integration and Optimization Program and the Quality Improvement Program, they're not in other.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Other -- you need to consider other is medical and new ventures type of things, and that's a kind of small potpourri of quite a few things.", "Lori Chaitman", "Chip, do you have another question related to something else?", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "So as you mentioned, sort of, interest expense looks like it's going down, which is great as we -- based on your full year guidance. And as you pay off debt in 2014 and '15, how should we think about that going down? In other words, do you have higher-cost debt you can buy in or call in? Or would it tend to be short-term debt that isn't as costly?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. So we do have some higher-cost debt that will mature in February of next year. That's the 12% debt. It's $150 million. So we will be paying that off. And so we'll address that. In terms of looking at the balance of our debt, the next maturity that we would have after that is $8 million in an 8% senior note that's due in September 2019. Their first call date is September 2015. In addition, we've got our Term Loan B, which has a final maturity October 2018. Its current balance is about -- almost $800 million. It's got a 101 soft call, and it expires in November -- that soft call expires in November. So we have some opportunities to look at our total capital structure, and we'll do that as it best suits the cost structure for the company.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. First off, you had indicated that in some cases, on the Protective Packaging side, you were walking away from business and/or customers just weren't willing to pay, so they essentially were walking away. I guess, in -- my question is on the pricing negotiations that you had in the food packaging portion of the business. Have you seen any similar movements from customers where that business has, just because of an unwillingness to meet your pricing, has just walked away? Or is that not the case yet?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "No. The nature of those 2 businesses are very, very different. You -- we have -- we gain and lose for customers much more easily in Protective Packaging compared to Food & Beverage businesses because there is, in some cases, a lot of technology in our food packaging business, et cetera. As I said before, some of our businesses in food packaging are in formula. Some others are in strict negotiations. We are, by far, the technology leader in food packaging. We are, by far, the big dog in the protective packaging industry. We are not having highly tense conversations. It's not always about just price. It is about the value that you create to your customers. So when we tell our customers that next round, when their business is going to continue growing, they will ask for new volume and additional volume and that when we run at capacity, we are not going to be able to supply them because we don't have reinvestment economics, they understand. They don't like it, but they understand. It is about this equation of cost competitiveness and performance, and so we need price increases. We have had our food packaging business, which has had -- which was, 10 years ago, much higher quality than it is today. It has constantly been going down, and that is not acceptable. So we need to have this partnership dialogue with our customers, and we do have that, and they understand. So that's what's going on. Plus, we have some incredibly innovative products. I mentioned some, the Simple Steps, the Oven Ease, the -- et cetera, et cetera, our products that create a lot of value to our customers.", "Operator", "And that is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Peribere, I will now turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing remarks.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So -- well, let me thank you all for your participation on the call today. The confidence that our plan to improve Sealed Air quality of earnings is underway, is there. We have people who are really pleased with the progress we have in this company. We are -- our employee force is highly motivated. They're seeing that we have a project. They are adhering to this project, and they are proud of what we're doing. That is the cement, that is the foundation of our future success.", "Our second quarter performance is also a true testament to our leadership team and all of our employees and their commitment to continue progressing. The second half is -- we have given you a guidance in there, and it is a reasonable guidance given the external factors that are impacting our business. Latin Europe is problematic. They -- our sales have suffered, and we should not hide ourselves that it is going to be many years before the EU-27 countries will have a 2% GDP growth. It's not there. It's far from there, and it is disappointing, but it is the reality.", "We have suffered from major currency devaluations in Latin America. The real is at about BRL 2.28, BRL 2.29 today, and it was at BRL 2.04 at the beginning of last quarter -- of this -- yes, of second quarter. The Argentinian peso has also dramatically devaluated. We're seeing decelerating growth -- nice growth but decelerating growth trends in China.", "But despite those macroeconomics, there is a very clear direction for our business. We have pricing discipline, which is beginning to gain traction. We are pleased with this, very pleased with the momentum, internal momentum and understanding from our people and with some of our customers' reactions that I already talked to you about. We focus on providing significant value and innovative solutions to our customers, and we're becoming more nimble. So therefore, we are creating a better way for life, which is the vision of Sealed Air.", "Thank you very much. Have a great day. Goodbye.", "Operator", "Thank you for joining today's conference.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which replies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.", "We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.", "Please note that we will end the call by 11 a.m. today.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. 2013 was a solid year for Sealed Air. We made significant progress on our Get Fit strategy. We increased EBITDA, excluding SARs, on a year-over-year basis by 7% in 2013 and this is only the second time the company has delivered EBITDA margin growth in 11 years and that should speak for this leadership team. I'm also very pleased that we held firm on our pricing initiatives, reinforced our efforts in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we delivered favorable price/mix trends in every division in every region. Our free cash flow performance was outstanding. In addition to our forecast on reducing working capital as the Grace settlement became more likely, we put forth a tremendous effort over the last few months of 2013 to generate cash. We generated $509 million of free cash flow.", "The Grace settlement is a significant development and what I would call a major milestone. It brings closure to an important legal matter after more than a decade. We will no longer incur interest on the settlement liability and we anticipate meaningful cash tax benefits. This will provide us with additional financial flexibility and cash generation in future years.", "And we're very happy with what we have accomplished in 2013. Not only have we started to change our go-to-market strategy, but we also rebranded the company, reorganized Diversey Care, reengaged our employees and set the foundation to reimagine the company. Along the way, we are improving the delivery on our objectives. Since we started this journey, we have heard -- we have heard -- you have heard us back -- talk about a more disciplined pricing strategy and passing on our raw material cost increases. We started that initiative in Q1 and Q2 with moderate success, but fully executed in Q4 with our price increase in North America effective as of November 1. You can count on us to continue to be very disciplined on this in the future and in light of the recent and announced cost increases in benzene, propane and polyolefin.", "Let's now turn to our performance by region for the quarter and the year, which you will see on Slide 4 and 5 of our presentation, for a quick look at our fourth quarter and year-end performance. In the quarter, we continued to see solid sales growth in AMAT and Latin America, with constant dollar growth of 8% and 7%, respectively. Developing regions in total increased 9% in the quarter, accounting for approximately 26% of our sales. Sales in North America increased by 4% in constant dollar, which was mostly from our Food Care and Product Care divisions. Trends in developing regions have been consistent all year. North America performance has also performed relatively well.", "In Europe and in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, or JANZ, we experienced more positive trends in the fourth quarter compared to the first 9 months of the year. In Europe, constant dollar sales increased 3%, led by 5% growth in both France and Spain and 2% growth in the U.K. Holland was essentially flat. Germany declined very slightly and Italy declined by 5%. But these 6 countries combined accounted for approximately 22% of the fourth quarter sales and sales in JANZ increased 3%, which was led by a 5% increase in New Zealand.", "Slide 6 outlines our price/mix and volume trends for the quarter and for the year. Overall, as I said earlier, we delivered positive price/mix and increased volumes in Q4 for the whole year.", "Let me now take you some more details by division. And turning to Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 4% in constant dollars with approximately 4% growth in packaging and nearly 5% growth in hygiene. We reported growth in all regions, led by 11% in AMAT and 7% in Latin America as these volumes continued to increase in the high single-digit low double-digit levels in this region. In North America and Europe, we increased sales approximately 4% and 3%, respectively, despite the ongoing single-digit declines in base production. And JANZ also increased sales by 2% with 11% growth in New Zealand. On a global basis, we are seeing strong growth in the fresh red meat and smoked unprocessed market segment, primarily driven by an increase in demand for our case-ready, quick and easy open solutions. In hygiene, we delivered 4% growth driven by strength in emerging markets with our clean-in-place solution and in beverage and brewing, despite the overall market conditions.", "The trends we experienced in the fourth quarter and for the full year on a regional basis and market basis were very similar, with the exception of Europe and JANZ. For the year, Europe is -- was essentially flat on a constant currency basis, but delivered positive growth trends in the fourth quarter. Despite continuing negative trends in certain European countries, we gained share in the quarter and increased demand for our advanced product solutions and started to see a more stable economic environment. JANZ was also flat for the year, but delivered positive trends in Q4, as growth in New Zealand accelerated from Q3 to Q4.", "Our favorable price/mix performance was -- of just over 3% in the quarter, was attributable to our focus on driving pricing discipline within Sealed Air and our continued shift toward a more favorable product mix. For 2014, we expect beef production in Latin America and AMAT to continue at a similar growth rate that we experienced in 2013. This is expected to be offset by expected single-digit declines in North America and Europe.", "As it relates to our Food Care business in developing -- in the developing regions, we will continue to benefit from not only rising beef production, but also increasing hygiene standards and demand from our innovative solutions. With the protein market expected to decline again in 2014 in North America and Europe, our growth in these regions will continue to depend on driving demand for our value-added services, including integration of systems automations, advanced food safety solutions and new products that provide convenience and drive consumption.", "I wanted to briefly highlight the EBITDA margin performance that Food Care delivered in the quarter. While unfavorable supply chain costs and catch-up on incentive compensation for strong full-year performance negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, Food Care adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs, increased by 8% for the full year 2013 and full year margin improved to 15.2% from 14.3% last year -- the year before, in 2012.", "Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3%, driven by another strong performance in the developing regions and growth in all of our core sectors led by building care services. On a regional basis, constant currency sales growth in Q4 was up by approximately 13% in Eastern Europe, 8% in Latin America and 6% in AMAT. We have experienced similar growth trends in developing regions throughout the year. In Europe, constant dollar sales increased 3%, led by double-digit growth in France, Spain and Sweden. And this is our first quarter in 2013 where we saw positive trends in Europe while -- and while the recovery is fragile, this performance is worth noting.", "As we experienced volumes -- as we anticipated, volumes in North America improved from the decline we experienced last quarter and sales were essentially flat in Q4 on a year-over-year basis. For the full year and for the first time in 10 years, Diversey Care in North America delivered top line growth. As we anticipated, volumes in North America improved from the decline we experienced last quarter and sales were essentially flat in the fourth quarter.", "For the full year, again, we have experienced this top line growth. These trends -- this performance was attributable to growth across all core sectors as a result of new customer wins and product launches. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs, increased 10% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter and for the full year was just north of 10%. This improvement was primarily driven by a more favorable mix and price cost spread, realization of cost synergies and our rightsizing initiatives.", "Looking forward now for Diversey Care, we believe that we will continue to deliver strong performance in developing regions, albeit at a slower pace due to currency devaluations in many of these countries relative to 2013 and see more stability throughout Europe. As it relates to our strategy for Europe, we will continue to focus on bottom line improvements and eliminate business that is not aligned with our profit expectations. Our growth in North America will be driven by our ability to successfully execute on our targeted growth strategy. I want to reiterate what we said last quarter, which is that we are very focused on improving the earnings or quality of this division, including the ongoing cost savings initiatives and eliminating customer and portfolio bleeders.", "Turning to Slide 9. Product Care delivered 5% constant currency sales growth with 5% growth in North America and approximately 2% growth in Europe. We had a mid-single-digit growth in the U.K. and Italy and Germany was essentially flat, but France declined by 2%. These year-over-year trends in Europe are an improvement from last quarter again. We are encouraging, but we are -- but at the very same time, the recovery is slow and we are planning appropriately.", "In terms of pricing and product mix, I am pleased to report a positive impact of 1.7% in the quarter on a global basis. This is a direct result of our decision to hold firm on pricing, walk away from low-margin businesses and focus on growing our packaging systems and cushioning business, which is benefiting from our focus on the e-commerce market. I also want to point out that U.S. Product Care delivered 3% in favorable pricing in the quarter despite our price increases being effective as of November 1. And I'm very pleased with this performance and reaffirm our resolve as we face new resin and raw material increases in the first quarter.", "The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin on a year-over-year basis for the year was primarily due to raw material costs increases not fully offset by price increases and favorable product mix and higher supply chain cost. This suggests that we still have a lot of opportunity to improve on each of the items that I just mentioned.", "And now, I'll turn over the call to Carol, to provide additional comments in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2014.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you are following along with our presentation, Slide 10 provides a bridge for net sales growth on a year-over-year basis for the quarter and full year. We delivered 3% growth in the fourth quarter and 2% growth for the full year. Currency had a 1% unfavorable impact on the quarter and full year 2013, primarily due to declines in Latin American currencies, most notably in Argentina and Brazil. For the quarter, volumes contributed $27 million and price/mix was $52 million positive, driven by favorable trends in all divisions and in all regions. For the year, volumes contributed $114 million and price/mix was $94 million positive, primarily due to favorable trends for Food Care and Diversey Care.", "Slide 11, just like the adjusted EBITDA bridge, excluding SARs, for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat compared to last year. Favorable mix and price cost spread of $26 million and cost synergies of $28 million were largely offset by $31 million in unfavorable supply chain cost and $17 million in performance-based compensation. The unfavorable supply chain costs were primarily related to $12 million of nonmaterial inflation, $8 million of LIFO adjustments and $4 million for timing of inventory adjustments. We recorded additional performance-based compensation of $17 million in the fourth quarter. This is in recognition of our strong year-over-year performance for the full year 2013 in the areas of adjusted EBITDA, working capital management and other key financial metrics.", "For the year, adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs, increased to $1.07 billion from $1 billion in 2012. The 7% increase in EBITDA was attributable to $112 million of cost synergies, $41 million of favorable mix and price cost spread and $40 million in volume. These increases were partially offset by $25 million in performance-based compensation, $34 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $61 million in the Other category you see on the bridge. The Other category includes $46 million of unfavorable supply chain cost primarily related to nonmaterial inflation. As a reminder, we have previously communicated that our annual salary, wage and benefit inflation is approximately $55 million to $60 million. The increase in SG&A expense and approximately $25 million of the unfavorable supply chain costs are related to this compensation inflation.", "In 2013, SARs expense was $38 million, as compared to $18 million in 2012. As of December 31, we have 1.3 million SARs outstanding, which compares to 1.9 million I shared with you on the October earnings call for Q3. Of the 1.3 million SARs outstanding, 800,000 are unvested. In 2014, 500,000 will vest with the remaining 300,000 vesting in the first quarter of 2015. Based on our recent experience, we expect SARs to be exercised within a few months of their vesting date.", "Now, turning to Slide 12. We generated $509 million of free cash flow, a $238 million improvement over 2012. As Jerome indicated earlier, we put forth a tremendous effort in the last few months of the year to accelerate cash generation in preparation of the Grace Settlement. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow is primarily due to higher net earnings and significant net working capital improvements. We made meaningful progress on collection of customer past dues and we reduced our day sales outstanding by more than 3 days. We also reduced our days on hand inventory by 4 days and increased our days payable by 2 days. Our simple working capital, as a percent of net trade sales, improved from 19% at the end of 2012 to 17% at the end of 2013. We are confident that we can not only maintain this improvement, but can continue to leverage improvements in our investment in working capital.", "Cash restructuring payments were $107 million in 2013, which was less than the $140 million we guided to in our October conference call. As we have shared in the past, timing of execution of certain restructuring activities can be uncertain especially in Europe. Our CapEx in 2013 was $116 million, compared to $123 million in 2012. SARs cash payments totaled $46 million for the full year 2013, as compared with $24 million in the prior year. Looking forward, our primary use for free cash flow generation continues to be focused on reducing leverage.", "Our outlook for the full year 2014 is summarized on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $7.7 billion, with organic growth of approximately 3% to 4%, which is due to positive trends in both price and volume. This will be offset by product rationalization of approximately 1% to 2% and an estimated unfavorable impact of more than 2% from foreign currency translation.", "Going forward, we will provide our outlook with a few changes from past practices. For adjusted EBITDA, we will include the noncash profit-sharing expense in our guidance, as it is an actual expense for the company and it's estimated to be approximately $40 million in 2014. Additionally, we are providing guidance for adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share excluding the impact of SARs. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs and including profit-sharing expense, to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion. This compares to $1.038 billion in 2013 or an increase of 1% to 3% on flat top line. We expect adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our 3 core divisions.", "We expect depreciation and amortization to increase to approximately $315 million from $307 million in 2013. This increase is due primarily to bringing our long-term incentive compensation in line with market. We are committed to align our employees with our shareholders and this includes providing market-competitive share-based compensation.", "Now that Grace is behind us, we estimate interest expense to be approximately $295 million. The core tax rate for 2014 is expected to be approximately 25%. We estimate adjusted earnings per share, excluding SARs, to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, an increase of 8% to 15%, as compared to 2013 adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, also excluding SARs. Please note that our guidance for earnings per share has always been net of profit-sharing expense.", "Now, let's turn to our guidance for free cash flow. We anticipate 2014 free cash flow to be approximately $410 million. CapEx is estimated at $170 million. Our restructuring payments are estimated at $150 million. We expect cash interest to be approximately $280 million. Cash taxes are estimated at approximately $100 million.", "To wrap up, I want to say that we made a lot of progress in our financial performance and disciplines in 2013. The entire company is committed to continuous improvement and we very much look forward to the year ahead.", "And now, operator, can you please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two-part...", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, if need be, you could move to the next question, then we can go back to George.", "Operator", "Next question then comes from the line of Alex Ovshey, who is from Goldman Sachs.", "Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Usha Guntupalli on behalf of Alex. A quick question on the pricing growth. Could you remind us how much pricing growth is factored in your 2014 EBITDA guidance?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So, what -- the amount we gave for the organic growth, it's slightly more on pricing than it is on volume, but we will benefit top line for both price as well as volume. But again, that's being offset by currency, negative currency impact, as well as very intended product, customer and geographical rationalization to improve the quality of the business. So again, we said 3% to 4% organic growth with that more heavily weighted on pricing.", "Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And is your target to mostly offset resin inflation? Or is your target to get pricing over and above resin inflation?", "Carol P. Lowe", "The minimum is resin inflation, but we also have inflation above just our resin cost. We have other nonmaterial inflation, whether it's utilities and things like that. And our expectation is to be more than whole, so that we see margin expansion. Jerome, I don't know if...", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So let me repeat what I said 1 year ago and not wavering an inch on this. We have, in Sealed Air, we have a very clear and determined left brain and a very clear and determined right brain. The left brain is about discipline and Get Fit. A very clear element of the Get Fit component is to start by recouping our cost increases. And you heard in my prepared remarks that we have not been very successful in Q1 and Q2 with our price increases compared to our cost increases. Remember that in the U.S., resin prices went up by $0.12 in January of last year. And we have implemented those cost increases, but -- those price increases, but not fully. I was dissatisfied toward the year as to the rate of implementation. And I must clearly say that I was quite happy with our result, determination and the systems that we have put in place with regards to our October announcement effective November 1. And there is -- there's all kinds of things, including a cultural change that we needed to make sure was happening in our various markets. And I must admit that our people saw that it was possible and we're not here in the business of absorbing those costs. So we need to make sure that our people start by understanding that very clearly that we are not in the business of absorbing it completely or partially. And for 2014, we're going to continue to raise this. The resin suppliers have announced $0.04 for February. There's a very large supplier who has announced a $0.06 for March and we're not going to be waiting. You're going to see very soon that we are announcing officially price increases to cover for those costs because we can do that. So that's the left brain, or that's the part of our Get Fit, which belongs to the left brain. The right brain is about changing the game. And this is where we are also determined to improve and change our go-to-market strategy where we are going to -- or in where we're starting to make progress in charging our customers for the value that we create. That is if you have attended our Investor Day in September, you saw 2 arrows. There was a dark one starting very dark and lightening up with our Get Fit because we will have achieved the discipline, the cost control, et cetera, et cetera, over the years. And there's another arrow, which was starting light in the shade and going darker and darker in -- for our Change The Game. This means that as we become very, very focused industry by industry, as we're here to add value to our customers, we are then going to be able to charge for the value we create. If you want just one example, in the meats business, I was last week at a conference with a very large meat producer. And I told him that in essence, we are in the business of helping them value their meat more expensive. This goes to better shelf life, to better hygiene, to improved packaging. That's what we are in the business of. And they say, \"If you can do that, we're onboard.\" We're onboard because we are going to make sure that we are going to be -- that as we add value to them, we're going to be able to add value to ourselves.", "Operator", "Your next question is now from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm not sure what happened before with the transmission, but thanks for getting me in the queue. Real -- just brass tacks kind of question here in 2 parts. You, I think, said your adjusted earnings pre-SARs is $1.39 for the year that just passed. I think in the past, the benefit of Grace would be something in the low teens from an earnings per share standpoint and realizing that's a full year number, but we'll use it to start. If I just add the 2 together, I get in to the low end of your guidance range for the year. And", "[Audio Gap]", "Carol P. Lowe", "the low end. We will have benefit on cost savings that were estimating additional synergy costs. Those, we have factored in approximately $80 million that will benefit in 2014. However, a lot of that is utilized by that $55 million to $60 million in annual inflationary costs that we see. Now, a lot of you would say, \"Carol, you told us last year, it was $55 million to $60 million. Why is it still $55 million to $60 million when we've had headcount reductions?\" One of the challenges that we faced is that we do have a pretty large employee base and some highly inflationary economy specifically in Latin America. And that has created a drag where we're not realizing quite as much of a reduction in that annual compensation increase. What our forecast represents in total is we've conducted a very detailed bottom-up forecast that our divisions have put together, they believe in, they have high confidence in. We've always said that this new management team for Sealed Air, we're going to be very prudent", "[Audio Gap]", "...in our expectations. Please rest assured, we clearly have internal stretch goals, but what we're presenting to you today is something we feel very confident about.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So let me add just a little bit of", "[Audio Gap]", "Operator", "Next question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just given the increase in Europe from a volume perspective, understanding that comps are easy. Jerome, should we start to expect that the next leg of pricing for the company starts to focus on that region? I assume that raw material prices could start to book higher if the recovery there is sustainable.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So, Ghansham, good to hear from you. The pricing -- the cost raw materials increases right now are fairly widespread but depending on the region and depending on the raw material. Benzene prices have gone -- have been shooting very high and this is affecting MDI and this is affecting the propylene chain. So our Instapak business is affected and we are announcing price increases. We have announced price increases in Europe. And we are announcing price increases in North America to that effect. The polyolefin business prices are mostly coming from -- in North America and the market is somewhat softer in Europe. But we also have announced some price increases in our films and polyethylene-based products. Bearing in mind also, there are some price increases affecting the nylon base. So the reality is that the raw materials are increasing in different areas at different levels, but what has been a very clear trend is that the benzene prices have been very firm, and this is -- and therefore, we need to react quickly in that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "At your Analyst Day in September, you guided to 2016 sales of, I think roughly, $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. And when I think about sales guidance for 2014 being basically flat and that top line growth guidance maybe being back-end loaded to 2015, 2016, I'm just wondering how we should think about that. Is 2014 just really impacted by the FX headwinds? Or are you expecting some sort of contribution from emerging markets or a price that you expect to really accelerate in 2015, 2016?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So 2 points here. One is that you need to compare at equal, equal", "[Audio Gap]", "is that I would have done faster in 2013 in retrospect is go stronger at the low-quality businesses. We need to continue and we will this year continue to streamline for bleeders or for low-return customers. This is applying to every single of our product line in every single of our 3 divisions. So I am -- I want growth, but I don't -- I first want quality growth. And to have quality growth, you need first to have a streamlined and clean portfolio. And that's going to continue in 2014, which is affecting our top line growth in general. So we really take at heart this Get Fit. We're taking it very, very seriously because it is our disciplined approach, which is going to make a different company.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Question on working capital, or maybe 2 related questions on it. The first is it looks like you took a really serious push on working capital, especially in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering on the inventory side or the inventory reduction side, if that reduction had any operating issues or resulted in any operating issues, or maybe you didn't run at optimal rates across your normal platform and if that had any impact on, say, the margins? And then just as a follow-up, how should we think about working capital improvements and the potential for that in 2014? Because it did seem like you had some really, really big improvements in the fourth quarter in 2013 overall.", "Carol P. Lowe", "John, great questions. In terms of unabsorbed overhead, which is what we would have experienced if we had a lot of inefficiencies, in total for the company, no, on a collective basis, we did not. The negative impact that we did see is the LIFO adjustment that I referenced, because it spoke specifically for our Product Care business, as we reduced some inventory levels and because of the way LIFO works, we ate back into levels as far back as a basis to 1994. And because of that, we had that LIFO -- negative LIFO impact. So that's really the main obvious thing that we saw. We're very confident about our ability to continue to monetize working capital to create good cash flow for the company. One thing we were able to push really hard on the last couple of months of the year was accelerating collection of past dues. We've shared publicly in Q3 that our past dues were approximately $200 million. We still have $160 million of past dues. So we still have opportunity. Our cash flow that we're forecasting, if you do the walk, you'll see that the primary difference going from the $509 million for 2013 to the $410 million that we're forecasting -- for 2013, $410 million for 2014, is driven by the increase in restructuring charges to $150 million, as well as the increase in CapEx. So those are the 2 primary drivers for the decrease. We do believe we have additional opportunity in working capital and that will be part of our stretch goal internally.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So remember what short-term incentive compensation is based for our people. It's based on EBITDA and we almost reached our objective there; on productivity improvement, which is measured as expense to gross profit; and on working capital as a percentage of net sales too. As Carol said in the prepared remarks, we have improved 200 basis points, from 19% to 17%, and we're going to continue to improve. We can do that. Have we put a very strong stretch goal in Q4 internally? The answer is yes. And it is yes because the Grace settlement was coming and we wanted to come with a lower debt situation. So there's been a very strong push. But we are organizing this improvement, and our internal goal for this working capital to net sales is to improve over 17%. And that's a pretty nice thing. You mentioned also the quality of our business in Q4. At the end of the day, there are 2 things which have affected our cost base there. Number one is that our incentive compensation in 2012 was slightly below 70% for the incentive compensation was paid at slightly below 70%. And in 2013, it has been very slightly above 100%, so there's been some catch-up and which generated $17 million in there. And then the elements of inventory reduction and all of those things have played a small part in it also.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Back to -- a follow-up on George's question earlier about your guidance. So EBITDA was up about 8% last year. You're guiding to up about 2% this year. And I just want to make sure I understand the puts and takes. FX was about a 1% drag on sales last year. This year, it will be 1% to 2%. $30 million lower cost savings this year compared to last year. And anything in terms of price over costs that you're assuming in '14?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So that -- Adam, the currency impact is actually more than 2%, not 1% to 2%, on the top line and the impact on the bottom line on the EBITDA as well. We do -- we -- again, I reference the salary and comp and benefit inflation. We obviously have expansion in margin, which is what we're forecasting. We do have to have positive mix and price cost spread and that's factored in our EBITDA as well. And I also -- I talked about the approximately $80 million in cost synergies and we'll also have volume growth that will positively impact. But we will have, in addition to the salary labor wages and benefit cost increases, we will have some other nonmaterial inflationary costs also.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So you see, the currency thing here will depend on, at the end of the day, altogether, as to what the euro is doing. We had an Australian Dollar, peso or real or Canadian dollar and a U.K. pound devaluation in 2013 compared to 2012, but this has been partially offset by a slight strengthening of the euro when you compare to '12 and '13. We are -- you have seen all of these emerging countries devaluation happen in the last 4 to 5 weeks or even less than that, but we don't anticipate that the euro is going to revalue compared to the U.S. dollar. And therefore, we are a little bit prudent in that sense. What are we doing? Well, in the emerging countries where we can move to -- when we can move to dollar base, we're moving to dollar base. And In several countries in Latin America, we're moving to dollar-based pricing. And when we can't move to officially dollar-based pricing, we are implementing major price increases. This is what has happened in Q4, in our Brazilian market, for example where we went for major, major price increases in real in order to offset this kind of situation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili of Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Just wanted to clarify, Carol, on the '14 outlook, how you're thinking about pension expense. Because I would think that's a tailwind there. And so with the tailwind, I'm trying to understand what other offset might be to that.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay, so Al, I'm going to look real quick, I don't have the number right in front of me. But it's pretty much in line. It was a -- just not even a noticeable increase when we put together our 2014 plan.", "Lori Chaitman", "Do you have another question, Al?", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Pension expense is going to be flattish. And then are you -- and then as far as incentive comp, which was a big headwind in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about incentive comp '14 versus '13? Is that -- a headwind, flattish on the base guidance?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So if we perform the plan, which we've shared with you, it would be flat because we were just slightly above 100% payout factor for 2013 and we would -- we expect and plan to be no less than 100%. So in terms of the numbers we've shared with you, it would be about flat.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And target is -- and the target comp -- incentive comp, the target bogey is the EBITDA that you communicated...", "Jerome A. Peribere", "We don't normally give that.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Our plan that we've communicated in the past, it's weighted, a portion on EBITDA and as Jerome talked about, a portion on working capital improvement and a portion on a support expense as compared to gross profit. So...", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So we're going to keep having these same 3 criteria, which are EBITDA to our internal plan, which is -- and then, our productivity improvements as measured by expense to gross profit ratios and our working capital as a percentage of net sales improvements. Same criteria as last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Manuel of Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I kind of want to come back to the same -- because I'm still, I think, missing a couple of elements when I think about the EBITDA bridge '13 to '14. If I started the $1.04 billion that you did this year and I look at the movement to next year, it's kind of in that $12 million to $32 million of higher EBITDA. And if I start from the earlier comment you made that price would be more of a component of the organic revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, if you have a couple points of price within there, that could be upwards of $150 million of improvement. The $80 million of cost savings, I get something that should be in the kind of low mid-200s is where you could improve. And I recognize you had the offsets of -- you've talked about $60 million of inflation, et cetera. But there's still, Carol, seems to be a gap that I'm having a difficulty bridging. Can you maybe give us that...", "Carol P. Lowe", "I think you're a little high on the mix and price cost spread that you're looking at.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "One thing is the price. The other thing is price cost spread.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes, because it has to fall down...", "Jerome A. Peribere", "We are anticipating some cost increases again for resins and other type of raw materials. So that is the situation. So the first question in the Q&A was about margin expansion and, one, is pricing discipline to recoup our cost increases; number two is margin expansions through what I talked about. So we are anticipating price, but not very much margin expansion. That's one. The second thing is that you have seen that we are talking about product rationalization. And in product rationalization, you are -- we're going to be weeding some product lines or some products. And as a result of that, our overall volume projection is not very large.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just going back to the guidance here for a minute. If I look at the EBITDA growth year-over-year on a percentage basis, it looks like your -- you think you'll grow at about 30 basis points year-over-year. But if you continue to do that in 2015 and 2016, it does look like you'll come up short of the 14.5% to 15.3% EBITDA margin that you outlined for 2015.", "Carol P. Lowe", "So one thing, Scott, and it's a good point, but remember, we have $150 million in restructuring items that we're looking at that we'll start getting additional benefit for that as we move forward. And we haven't realized all of that benefit at this point. We continue -- we'll have $80 million. We'll have additional benefit as we move forward in 2015 and 2016. That will also help us. But we -- we're very confident in the 2016 numbers that we've provided. There's -- we wouldn't back off of those at all from a margin standpoint.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.", "If we look at the debt repayment, Carol, you paid down about $400 million in 2013. Could you give us a feel for how much you expect to pay -- to repay in 2014? And the timing of the cash going into Grace's asbestos fund, as well as the tax credit in 2014.", "Carol P. Lowe", "So we -- the timing was that we actually funded on Monday. So that's -- this past Monday, that's when the funding went in for the Grace settlement. We have $150 million for the 12% bonds that are outstanding that we'll pay middle of this month, actually on February 14. So we'll make that payment. With the cash flow generation, the free cash flow of $410 million, again, principally, all of that will be utilized to reduce debt. So it will be around that $400 million that we'll reduce debt in 2014. As it relates to the tax refund, that actually will come in 2015, because we made the payment in 2014. It will be based when we file our 2014 tax return in early 2015 and we will get more than $200 million in 2015 that we'll also use for leverage reduction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of analyst Chip Dillon.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "A couple of questions, actually to follow up on that one on the tax benefits. If you look at the total value of the -- what you gave, $200 million would be certainly well below the corporate tax rate of 35%. So I'm kind of wondering, are there other sort of less visible benefits, whether you're paying less in estimated taxes in '14 or less in cash taxes than you otherwise would? And then on a separate basis, there was a great rundown on the SARs. And it would seem like this year, let's say 800,000 were actually exercised. Would that be roughly about a $40 million guesstimate as to what that number could be for this year?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So, Chip, as it relates to the taxes -- and we've said it's more than $200 million, part of the challenges we have -- in terms of carrying -- how much we'll carry back versus carry forward, we have to take into consideration where we're at on certain foreign tax credits, how those have been treated. And our tax department does a phenomenal job of making sure they get the most benefit for us that they can. So as we move forward and when we file the 2014 return, they'll look at our position for all of those. So that's why we're saying more than $200 million. We've previously communicated it could be up to $250 million. Again, it's going to depend on our position on other tax credits and certain tax initiatives. With respect to the 25% tax rate that we're guiding to for 2014 versus where we're for the 22% for 2013, one thing that's impacting that right now is that the U.S. Congress has not approved certain things such as R&D credit and look-throughs for intercompany transactions. We expect them to go back and do that retroactive. But right now, we have no assurances, so that's also negatively impacting our core tax rate that we're presenting. So you see a little bit of that happening as well. And then the second part of the question, remind me, Chip, again, what you were asking, I'm sorry. I got going on taxes so much, I forgot the second part.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, can you unmute Chip please?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Right. Okay, we'll put you back in the queue. My apologies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Yes. Just one follow-up question on the shares that you're transferring over as part of the -- or transferred over as part of the settlement or trust with Grace. Is there any lock-up period on those, or can those hit the market at any specific point? Are there any restrictions on how quickly those can be transferred out of the trust? Can you give us some color on that?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So John, it's 90 days -- 60 days, I'm sorry, that there'll be a lock-up on that. They have to be registered and everything. So we -- they've transferred and issued and they've always been in our outstanding share count. So it's not a negative impact from that standpoint, but it will be 60 days.", "Operator", "We now have Chip Dillon again.", "Lori Chaitman", "Sorry, about that Chip.", "Carol P. Lowe", "All right, Chip...", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "No worries at all. It was great, the rundown on the SARs and it looks like that's going to be finally behind you in 1 year or so. But I think you mentioned, Carol, that about 800,000 would likely vest this year. And if we guessed -- is the way to kind of think about it is where we just sort of take that number, if they were all exercised and multiplied times the stock price? Or just kind of remind us. Because of I did that, I would get to about $40 million in expense this year.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes. So it wouldn't be expense. That would be -- your math is correct, but that's the cash impact because they are converted to cash when they're exercised. They don't actually get Sealed Air equity, it's cash settled. The expense is already recorded up to the current stock value. There is a slight discounting we do for any unvested shares because some shares end up being forfeited if people leave and what have you. But generally, the way to think about it is whatever shares are there for the SARs, it's the change in the share price that impacts our expense.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from investor Scott Hendricks [ph].", "Unknown Attendee", "The strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet de-leveraging gives you more options for capital allocation over the coming years. My question is, with shares trading at a low teens multiple on cash EPS, how do you weigh buybacks versus dividends versus further de-leveraging, both philosophically and in terms of the timing?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So priority number one is de-leveraging. And when we will achieve the ratios we have talked about previously, then we -- then the board will decide how much of share buyback and how much of dividend distribution.", "Carol P. Lowe", "And as a reminder, it's about 3.5x to 4x that we feel comfortable that we would be able to look at options to return value to shareholders.", "Operator", "Do you have time for one more question?", "Lori Chaitman", "No. Operator, we're going to move to Jerome closing out, please.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for that. Thank you for your questions. I know hand over the call to Jerome Peribere for the closing remarks.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Well, thank you very much to all for your very active and very insightful questions. I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers and our shareholders for their ongoing support. I would also like to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to improving the operating and financial performance of Sealed Air. And the progress that we made in 2013 was no short of being remarkable, but there's still a lot of work to be done.", "Confident that our plan to improve Sealed Air's quality of earning is well underway and we expect to see continuous improvement throughout 2014 and the future years. 2013 performance is a true testament to our leadership team and their commitments, with very clear direction for our business. And we are very confident that we have the right strategy in place, focused on providing significant value and innovative solutions to our customers, becoming more nimble and, in the end, creating a better way for life.", "We look forward to speaking with you on our next meeting call, currently planned for April 30 of this year.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I will now turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I'd like remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.", "We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.", "Please note that we will end the call by 11 a.m. today. Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO, who is traveling internationally and joining us remotely today. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings results for the first quarter. Our first quarter performance is a true testament to what we are becoming: a company focused on helping our customers win through differentiated solutions and who shares in the value that we create. Including in our operating standard is the necessity to pass on our raw material cost increases in a timely manner. In addition to recovering inflationary costs, the results of our customer value creation approach also shows in the improving quality of our earnings. While there is always room for improvement and there is still plenty of work to do, we outperformed on most, if not all, of our key metrics in the first quarter. We are in the early stages of becoming a knowledge-based company, and I am confident that we are -- and we have the right strategy in place.", "Now I want to make you aware of an enhancement that we are implementing on our quarterly earnings releases. From time to time, we would like to give our division presidents the opportunity to speak with you on a more routine basis regarding their business, key trends and targeted performance metrics. And as always, Carol will provide a review of our financial results. For today's call, I have invited Karl Deily, President of our Food Care division, to provide you with a detailed update on our Food Care and highlight Product Care and Diversey Care performance. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, Carol and Karl will be available for questions.", "With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results presented by Carol. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. Let's start with our performance by region for the first quarter, which you will find on Slide 4 of our presentation. I will highlight sales trends on a constant dollar basis as compared to last year. Latin America and Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, or our AMAT region, continued to be our fastest-growing region, with growth of 10% and 7% respectively. North America sales were up 3.5% with favorable price/mix in each of our 3 core divisions. In Europe, our focus on quality of earnings and eliminating low-margin business resulted in a net sales decline of 2%. We experienced single-digit declines in France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland, which was partially offset by a 4% increase in Spain and relatively flat sales in the U.K. The 6 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 20% of first quarter sales. Sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were a slight -- a little over 1%, which was led by a 2% increase in New Zealand and a 13% increase in Japan, albeit off of a small base. This increase was partially offset by a 2% decline in Australia.", "On Slide 4, we -- Slide 5, we outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we have positive price/mix in every division and in every region. You can see our pricing efforts coming through, particularly in North America and Latin America. In North America, Latin America and AMAT, we experienced favorable price/mix across all divisions. This has been a tremendous effort, and we are extremely pleased with these results. It is worth noting that in Latin America and AMAT, we have experienced -- implemented price increases to address inflation, as well as to offset currency devaluation. Given the economic environment in Europe, we have not made as much progress implementing pricing initiatives as we have had in other regions. While in the first quarter, we had a slightly favorable price/mix in Europe, we have implemented additional pricing actions in Q1, the results of which we expect to see in the coming months.", "Our overall volume declined slightly compared to last year. Karl will cover these trends in more detail. But at a high level, Food Care volume in the quarter was relatively unchanged compared to 2013 despite the fresh red meat market being down approximately 3% to 4% in North America and Europe. Product Care volume, which was also essentially unchanged from the prior year, was negatively impacted by rationalization and unfavorable weather conditions in North America. The decline in Diversey Care volume was due largely to our efforts to eliminate low-margin business.", "Turning to Slide 6. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales bridge, positive price/mix of $62 million in the quarter was offset by a slight decline in volume. Unfavorable currency translation of $52 million was mostly due to the currency weakness in Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Turkey in the first quarter 2014, as compared to Q1 2013.", "For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a year-over-year basis to $252 million or 13.8% of net sales. We delivered 160 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and 110 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. And within each of our divisions, we had both gross margin and EBITDA margin expansion. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $36 million partially offset by negative volumes of $9 million. Cost synergies of $24 million were more than offset by $21 million of higher SG&A and other expenses, as well as $8 million of unfavorable currency.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.33 as compared to $0.23 in the first quarter last year. The adjusted tax rate for Q1 2014 was 21.4% and includes favorable tax settlement in foreign jurisdictions.", "Now I would like to pass the call to Karl, who will provide a detailed review of Food Care results and recap Diversey Care and Product Care performance for the quarter. Karl?", "Karl R. Deily", "Thank you, Carol. It's a pleasure to be with you today and join you on the call. I'd like to turn our attention to Slide 7, where I'll begin with Food Care, and Food Care sales increased 4% in constant dollars, with approximately 4% growth in both packaging and hygiene segments. As Carol indicated, Latin America and AMAT continued to be our fastest-growing regions. This growth is attributable to overall market growth, customer adoption of our innovative products and our pricing disciplines within these regions. As we look ahead, while we expect overall beef production to moderate in Latin America and AMAT over time, we have a very strong market leadership position and believe we will continue to experience healthy growth rates. We are penetrating these markets with our value-added solutions and services and experiencing better pricing.", "In Europe, our constant dollar net sales were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. These results outperformed the protein market, which was down approximately 3%. While the European economy appears to be stabilizing, the lack of GDP growth and flat to declining protein market continues to make it a challenging business environment. Despite the negative market environment, we are still focused on recovering our increased input costs. While we reported a slight increase in price/mix in quarter 1, it was not enough to cover the raw material cost increases that we've incurred over the last few years, and the reason why we went ahead and implemented additional increases in the first quarter of this year.", "Japan, Australia, New Zealand sales were relatively unchanged with 3% growth in New Zealand offset by a 3% decline in Australia. The decline in Australia was predominantly due to pruning of low-margin businesses offsetting favorable market conditions. In North America, the fresh red meat market declined more than 5% in the quarter, with cattle slaughter rates down approximately 5.2% and hog slaughter rates down approximately 4% to 5%. Despite these unfavorable market trends, our business in North America delivered constant dollar net sales growth of 5% due to favorable price/mix on relatively flat volumes. We just started seeing the porcine epidemic diarrhea, or PED virus, negatively impacting pork production in March in North America, and it is not expected to subside until end of the year.", "Going forward, in North America and Europe, we continue to experience single-digit declines in beef production. To date, we have done a very good job offsetting these declines with a more favorable product mix, better pricing and new product introductions, and we will continue this effort. With that said, we are anticipating a larger impact in North America and Mexico from the PED virus in the second and third quarters, as a result of continued declines in pigs per litter. For the full year, industry experts are estimating a reduction in the range of 1% to 7%, with the largest impact expected over the next 3 to 6 months.", "I want to briefly highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the first quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points to 17.6% compared to last year. This increase was largely attributable to price increases and adoption of our innovative product portfolio. While we delivered 9.5% year-over-year growth in the first quarter, the volume challenges in the beef and pork markets will negatively impact our business in the coming months. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA is only expected to be up slightly next quarter, as compared to the second quarter of last year. For the full year, we are anticipating EBITDA growth and margin expansion.", "I would like to now comment on our performance in Diversey Care and Product Care, and if you turn to Slide 8, I will start with the Diversey Care division. The highlights -- the results from our Diversey Care division show net sales on a constant currency basis were up 1%. Favorable price/mix of 3.2% was offset by a 2% decline in volume. We have made progress exiting low-margin business, particularly in Europe, where we experienced a 3% net sales decline on a constant dollar basis. This decline was offset by strong performance in developing regions, with an 8% increase in constant currency sales. This was led by double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and Latin America. We also delivered 2% constant dollar growth in North America despite a difficult shipping environment due to unfavorable weather conditions this winter.", "While we are focusing on customer rationalization and realigning our cost structure, we are also making targeted investments that will further differentiate Diversey Care's product offer in the marketplace. It's worth noting that during the first quarter, Diversey Care's innovative dishwashing product offer, Suma Combi, was recognized by Tomorrow's Cleaning magazine. It's a leading publication in the hygiene sector in the United Kingdom, where we won Best Product 2014 award.", "Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 8.8% of sales. This improvement was primarily attributable to a more favorable customer mix and improved pricing. Favorable mix and price/cost spread and synergies were offset by lower volumes, higher SG&A and negative currency translation.", "Looking ahead for Diversey Care, we continue to expect healthy growth in Eastern Europe, Latin America and AMAT. In North America, we expect our sales trend to be more balanced throughout the year, as compared to 2013, when we had a strong second quarter due to a significant buy-in from the distribution channel. In Europe, we are planning for volume declines, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of the business in a market environment that is not experiencing much GDP growth and the public-sector spending is constrained, especially in machines and tools.", "So if you turn to Slide 9, I'll now cover Product Care. Product Care delivered 3% constant currency sales growth with favorable price/mix of 2.1% and a slight uptick in volume. Constant currency sales in North America increased 2%, and Europe was essentially unchanged compared to last year. In North America, the 2% sales growth was driven by favorable price/mix of 4.2%. This was partially offset by a 2.4% decline in volume. We are seeing an increase in demand from our e-commerce and third-party logistics customers for our packaging systems and cushioning solutions, such as Instapak inflatable bubble and fill air solutions. Growth in packaging systems and cushioning were partially offset by declines in general use, which was negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions and rationalization. In Europe, relatively flat net sales were due to a slight uptick in volume, offset by an unfavorable product mix.", "Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.8% was up 160 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $70 million. This improvement was driven by favorable mix and price/cost spread, as well as cost synergies. While the Product Care team has made great progress over the last 3 to 5 months recovering raw material increases and improving the mix in North America, we still have plenty of work to do on this front, as raw material costs in 2014 are expected to be higher as compared to last year and are expected to continue to increase over the next few years.", "As we look ahead, the Product Care team has an objective of more than recovering raw material increases in order to be able to reinvest in future growth opportunities and innovation. We will continue to focus on providing our customers with automated value-added solutions that lower the cost per pack, reduce damage cost and minimize freight cost. Our volume will be further impacted by our rationalization efforts. However, we expect to offset lower volumes with an improvement in mix and better pricing.", "Let me now pass the call back to Carol to review cash flow, liquidity and our outlook. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Karl. I will now refer to Slide 10. As a reminder, we funded the W.R. Grace Settlement and related accrued interest with $555 million of accumulated cash and cash equivalents and $375 million from committed credit facilities. Free cash flow, excluding the settlement agreement, was a use of $36 million for the quarter. This compares favorably to a use of $63 million in the first 3 months of 2013, due to our improvement in earnings. Working capital as a percent of net trade sales improved from 19% at March 31, 2013 to 17% at March 31, 2014, which is consistent with where we ended the year 2013.", "CapEx in the quarter was $28 million. We expect capital expenditures to increase throughout the year, and at this time, are still estimating the full year to reach $170 million. Cash restructuring costs were $27 million. We estimate cash restructuring charges to be $150 million in 2014.", "Cash payments related to SARs were $14 million in the quarter compared with $17 million in Q1 2013.", "For the year, we have increased our free cash flow outlook to $425 million from the previous guided $410 million. Our primary use for free cash flow generation continues to be focused on reducing leverage.", "On Slide 11, we present our total liquidity post the settlement payment, as well as our net debt. I want to briefly discuss our liquidity position and where we expect to be at year end. To partially fund Grace, we used our revolver and accounts receivable securitization facility. We also paid down our $150 million 12% senior notes in February. We expect our liquidity position to improve over the balance of the year as we continue to use our free cash flow to delever. Our first priority for debt repayment is revolver borrowing. Because of our intent and ability to pay down the revolver within the next 12 months, our revolver outstandings are included in current liability despite the fact that they do not mature until September 2016.", "Net debt in the quarter increased $61 million to $4.4 billion from the balance at the end of 2013. This increase was a result of net cash used for seasonal inventory growth, annual incentive compensation payments and interest payments.", "Our outlook for the full year 2014 is summarized on Slide 12. We are maintaining our forecast for net sales of approximately $7.7 billion, with organic growth of approximately 3% to 4%, which is due to positive trends in both price and volume, offset by rationalization of approximately 1% to 2% and an estimated unfavorable impact of more than 2% from foreign currency translation.", "We are also maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. We currently estimate a full year tax rate of 27% compared to the guidance we previously provided of approximately 25%, due to lower income that is now anticipated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates.", "We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of our $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our 3 divisions as compared to 2013.", "The other category includes our medical business and our corporate and unallocated costs. We expect approximately $100 million of net costs in the other category for the full year, as compared with $88 million in net costs for 2013. The increase is primarily attributable to additional investments we are making in core R&D platform technologies, as well as anticipated negative impact from foreign exchange losses.", "As I mentioned earlier, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance from $410 million to $425 million to reflect the higher end of our EBITDA range. We still expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $295 million, and cash interest payments are estimated at $280 million.", "In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. And I would also like to note that our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for July 30 at 8:30 a.m.", "Operator, can you please open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's still early in the year, but clearly, you're raising your EBITDA forecast versus where you were pointing initially on the midpoint of the range, more bullish on cash flow. Carol, how does that change your view in terms of share buybacks for '14, particularly if your larger shareholders were starting to sell this year?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So Ghansham, what we'll do -- we're still committed to the 3.5x to 4x leverage. Obviously, with the guidance that we've provided, we will be within that range at the end of the year. And we would -- as we've indicated previously, we would approach the board, once we are within that range for support to return value to shareholders, which could be in the form of dividends or share repurchase. I think it is important just to remind everyone that within our existing credit facilities and notes, we do have a restricted payment basket, which does limit what is available in terms of share repurchase and dividends. So we have to monitor that. We do have -- again, the most restrictive right now would be relative to the revolver, but we do have restrictions as well on certain of the notes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Just as we dig a little bit into the free cash flow guidance, which is nice to see that it's up, could you just give us sort of the elements of the what looks to be about a $15 million increase?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So before, we were kind of midpoint for guidance, Chip, and now we're at the higher end from a free cash flow standpoint. So we were to do the walk from EBITDA, you would look at the $1.070 billion, high end of the guidance, you would -- we have previously communicated that we would expect a noncash profit-sharing expense of $40 million. We would have CapEx, the $170 million I've referenced, as well as cash restructuring charges of $150 million. We've also previously communicated that cash tax payments are expected to be approximately $100 million for the full year, and our interest payments are estimated at approximately $280 million. The net difference to get you to the $425 million is a combination of changes in our working capital, as well as SARs cash payments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The question I had is on pricing, 2 parts. One, could you comment as to where you're seeing the most significant difficulty? Obviously, you've had a lot of progress, but the most significant difficulty in implementing the new model across your product lines? And then the related point, are you seeing relatively good momentum either on pricing or volume with your foam-in-place businesses?", "Karl R. Deily", "Okay. Well, I agree with you that we have been very successful. We're doing what we said that we were going to do, and that we have been very effectively moving price in a number of the regions, predominantly in North America. In our AMAT region, we've been able to get price and volume. Australia and New Zealand we've been able to move price. Where we've had the most difficulty is in Europe. And that's where with the environment that we're in, in parts of Europe, it's been most difficult to move the price typically for Product Care and for Food Care. However, we are committed to going back, and we are going back. We have additional pricing actions that we've moved in the first quarter. And we will continue to work those actions, and we are extremely focused on improving the quality of the business and getting paid for the value that we bring to our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question on the food packaging side. I know you highlighted the volume issues around beef and I guess an impending issue on pork. I guess I'm wondering, is that -- because of the pricing dynamics around that, where beef prices and pork prices have gone up a lot, while it's hurting you on the volume, is it helping you in terms of being able to get price and maybe up-sell some of your products to maybe offset some of that, just because the value of the product that your customers are moving are so much higher than they had been 1 year or 2 ago?", "Karl R. Deily", "Well, it's one of those difficult balancing teeter-totter acts. It's difficult to drive price through to the market. I think we heard this morning Chipotle Grill increased their menu prices for the first time in 3 years. So it's not as easy for some of our customers to pass through pricing. But it is definitely, I think, helps the environment to drive both price. And we've have had an accretion of price and mix, especially in our major markets. And it's from just what you said, it's not only driving price, it's driving higher value-added solutions. We've been very effective in leveraging our value proposition into those markets to compensate for the lower production volumes. And obviously, our goal is to help our customers market a lower volume of product so that they can generate greater revenue for themselves. So I think both from providing higher mix value-added solutions as well as just the constrained market is favorable for accretive pricing actions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Carol, I think it was mentioned on the call that the first quarter didn't yet reflect all of the full pricing actions that have been thus far taken. And I was wondering if you could help us quantify what the annual benefit from that -- from the incremental pricing would be that wasn't yet reflected in the first quarter.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. So Al, the comment largely was related to Europe -- my specific comments. We have had additional pricing increases that were implemented in March that we would expect to see benefit of in the second quarter. However, as we've also noted, we will have offset due to rationalization, and Karl commented specifically about Q2 and potential impact from the protein market. But what I was commenting to was specific in Europe where we've had some price increases, but we -- they've not stuck as much as they have in other regions. So we will be going back in specific geographies and with certain customers where we've not realized as much of an increase to cover our inflationary costs as we should have, as well as addressing underperforming accounts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.", "Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple -- one question, but it has kind of 2 parts to it. I mean, first, kind of from the perspective of, I think, if we take the high end of your guidance range, that implies $32 million of EBITDA improvement for 2014 versus '13. But yet, after 1Q, you've already got $21 million of that kind of in hand. My question really kind of comes around what changes with the cadence over the balance of the year. Are you possibly anticipating that the pricing that you're putting in place, that the competitive landscape gets more difficult? Or it sounds like you're still anticipating some volume growth. What are the elements that become potentially more challenging that help make that either look very conservative or that are negatives maybe that we're missing?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So obviously, it's just one quarter that we've got under our belt, and -- but there's still uncertainties ahead. We do have confidence in terms of our EBITDA performance as we commented that we do expect improved EBITDA year-over-year, as well as EBITDA margins. However, as Karl has noted, the PED virus in North America and Mexico will be impacting the protein market for the remainder of the year, predominantly within Q2 and Q3. Within Product Care, staying disciplined on pricing, we do expect further rationalization as we eliminate low-margin business. That has an impact on volume, and we will experience some under-absorption. And that could also be the impact with Food Care with the decline in volumes related to the virus. For Diversey, again, great execution from the team on pricing disciplines, rationalization. They're being very proactive going after very low-margin accounts either to increase them or to exit them from the portfolio. The macroenvironment in Europe is still remaining very challenging, even though we are starting to see a little bit of stabilization. But again they're -- because of some of the higher fixed costs structure, we do have under-absorption relative to that business and it impacts the overall profitability. So again, Europe will be key as we move forward. And again on total for earnings per share, the tax is moving from 25% to 27% also impacts our earnings per share.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "The sales bridge in the slide indicates volumes were a $12 million hit year-over-year. And on the EBITDA bridge, volumes were a $9 million hit. And given you've done a lot of voluntary shedding of low-margin business, I guess the decremental margin was maybe a little higher than I expected. So given you had maybe some weakness in red meat or maybe weather, I was wondering if you could just give any color around that and the volume, what volume's really losing?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So the biggest impact is relative to Diversey. Again, as I just referenced on the prior question, because Diversey is more of a fixed cost structure as it currently stands versus Food Care and Product Care, if you look specifically at their volume impact and out of that $9 million, Diversey accounts for $6 million of it. So again, that's why we say when we get volume and top line growth in Diversey, it falls straight through to the EBITDA. So it's a great opportunity as we continue to see improvement in that business and the Diversey Care team works to align its cost structure. We do expect in the second half of 2014 to see some of -- a greater impact for the alignment of the cost structure for Diversey Care. But that's the primary driver why you see such a big drop from the sales line to the EBITDA line.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "In the Food Care business, I mean, clearly you're making some pretty good progress on the pricing front. Can you just talk about the impact that had on your market share across the key product lines, if any?", "Karl R. Deily", "Sure, Alex. We don't talk specific market shares. But I think you can see how we have performed above the market, that not only with our pricing, but with the new solutions that we're introducing to our customers, that we've been able to outpace the market. So as we look forward in North America, we've had basically flat volumes. But we have the headwinds of the reduced slaughter rates and the second and third quarter impact of the PED virus on volumes that we're expecting. In Europe, sales have been relatively flat, but there are obviously various dynamics in the European market. And I think we continue to have some losses due to pricing, but we also have had some very great wins, and that's both on the packaging side and the hygiene side of our business. So we continue to manage the markets and our business very closely. And in areas where the markets are growing, like in Europe, there are parts of the market of that are strong, whether it be Russia, U.K., Northern Europe, other markets that are very weak, like Southern Europe, France, Italy, to name just 2. At Latin America, where volumes are dropping a little bit, but they're still improving, what we do is we just very much look at selling new products, penetrating those markets and managing our margins.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.", "Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "In 2013, your EBITDA contribution from price/mix was $41 million. And in this quarter alone, it was $36 million. If you run rate that, you get to close to $150 million this year. What's embedded in your full year EBITDA guidance in terms of the price/mix contribution, as well as any loss of volume related to those price increases and to the product rationalizations that you talked about earlier?", "Carol P. Lowe", "In terms of our guidance, what we talked about was the fact that we would have -- so 1% to 3% year-over-year growth versus 2013. And in terms of the rationalization that, that would be -- we have organic growth of 3% to 4%. And that's due to both positive trends in price and volume. We've not split that out specific to the organic growth. And we would have rationalization of 1% to 2%. And again, the foreign currency translation is a meaningful impact on the top line at more than 2% estimated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to focus for a minute on the rationalization. I think kind of like, Carol, on that last answer, you just said that -- hoping [ph] to get that 1% to 2%. But can you talk about the process -- the progress you're making on rationalization? Do you think there's a opportunity to accelerate that and maybe get that done in a 12-month period rather than 18- to 24-month period? And if so, what segments are running ahead of schedule?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So if -- and Karl can comment specifically on Food Care, as well as provide color for Product Care and Diversey Care. But in general, just to remind everyone, when we talk about rationalization, it is by customer, it's by product, it's by geography. And we are approaching it in a very surgical fashion to make sure -- the first step is to see if we can maintain business by increasing pricing or changing the product offering that we may deliver to a customer to improve the overall quality of earnings that we realize either from a customer or a certain geography and from a product line. So that's the first approach, so that does take time. We are making meaningful progress. It's showing in our earnings results in Q1, as we are improving the quality of our earnings in a meaningful way. We then follow that, if we're not successful, in some of those direct approaches to our customers or with specific product lines, then we have to move to exit. Obviously, we can't just abandon a customer by not supplying them. We have to have it timed correctly because they may have other products that they buy from us, or we may have other support within a certain geography that we have to meet. So we will accelerate as best we can. Obviously, we would prefer to have the improvement in earnings on a quicker basis because that gives us additional cash to reinvest in the business in terms of innovative products that we can bring to market, as well as delevering and getting to a position where we can return value to shareholders. Karl, I don't know if there's anything specific...", "Karl R. Deily", "Yes, Scott, the only thing I would add is it's a discipline. And it's like quality or safety. I think it's a job that never ends. And hopefully, you get -- make progress on some of the significant dilutive customers, products or countries. But you just continue to work the process, and it is a process. And you could then have a major devaluation like Argentina experienced in January. You focus on that, and you may have other things that ebb and flow. But in general, I think it's an ongoing process, and a discipline. And I think we're becoming much better at it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Margins in Diversey Care was quite strong, but off an easy comp in Q1. How much of the improvement was you walking away from some bleeders? And should we see continued momentum on the margins front? And can you provide an update on the progress in your push in North America?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So we -- a lot of the progress that we made in Diversey Care was due to exiting very low-margin business. That made a meaningful contribution to the margin improvement. We expect, as we move forward for the balance of the year, as Karl noted, that we will have continued margin improvement for the full year. However, we also referenced the fact that Q2 comps will be a bit challenged because there was a pull forward in Q2 2013 on some sales for the distribution channel that we won't expect to repeat. We expect it to be more normalized in 2014 than it was in 2013, a little bit smoother. In terms of North America, we are making progress. We referenced that our sales were up 2%. And that was despite the fact that it was a very challenging quarter from a weather perspective within North America. So we're pleased with our results. And the team continues to do just a great job executing on its strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.", "Carol, I was wondering if you could touch on the cash generation next year, as well as the tax refund anticipation from the Grace transaction or solution. You gave us the numbers, the cash used in 2014, yes, with CapEx, restructuring, interest expense. Can you compare that with next year -- or compare next year with this year, rather?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So we've not provided details for 2015. We have talked about the fact that by 2016, we expect to have $600 million in free cash flow. That was provided during our Analyst Day back in September last year. I will note that as it relates to the refund that we expect to receive due to the Grace Settlement having actually funded that in 2014, that our cash benefit for 2015 is expected to be slightly in excess of $200 million when we file our 2014 return in early 2015.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from John McNulty.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question maybe for Karl, with regard to the customers that may have left because of pricing issues where you've raised price on them, have you -- is it too early yet, or have you seen any indication of them coming back because either competitors have followed through on price or the customers actually realized, \"Hey, you know what, there's more value than we thought. And we're coming back.\" Like, have you seen any trends like that yet? Or again, is it too early to tell?", "Karl R. Deily", "John, it's probably too early to tell. But we have had some of that occur in Europe on the hygiene side of the business, where we implemented some significant pricing actions to the market, where our margins or our performance just wasn't to our standards. And actually, within 2 or 3 months, 2 of the customers that had left us came back either due to our -- value of our products and services, or the inability of the competitor to supply. So we do believe that we provide great value, as we market our value proposition, that we provide great value to our customers. And we believe when some of them do step away that they will come back.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Bigger picture question for everyone, including Jerome if he's on the line, when we've seen companies go through transformation turnaround programs, call them what you will, usually the first couple of years are where you make the most progress. There's an obvious pricing need that needs to be addressed and gets addressed. There's an obvious cost reduction move that needs to be addressed and gets addressed. And the momentum is good. And then invariably, these strategies for the companies lose momentum in year 3 or 4. How do you -- if you agree with that premise, how are you going to maintain momentum within Sealed Air, as you go -- get past year 1, year 2 in this transformation? Or what specifically are you worried about and what specifically will you do?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So let me take that one. Am I on the line?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes, you are.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So good question. The -- and this is why we have 2 programs. One is called \"Get Fit\", and it is about -- all I talked about was, for a long time, was a disciplined approach to what needs to get fixed. And yes, we're making faster progress than I originally thought. But I'm not surprised because we have very clear guidelines, very clear metrics, and we are fabulously executing on all of those. But the next step, which we are starting to do, is the famous \"Change the Game.\" And the \"Change the Game\" is a more value-add approach to our customers. And you need to know that in Sealed Air, we have -- we are absolutely obsessed with making our customers win. And winning for our customers is about adding margin to them through value-add solutions, and then we share in the value. And this is a whole program, and of course, we don't want to say too much about that until we launch some of those. But in the 3 divisions that we have, we are very focused in developing those, talking actually right now with some customers about some of those, and this is what is starting now and which is going to gain tremendous momentum over the years, which is why during Investor Day, I was showing you this curve, which was taking us to a certain level of EBITDA towards 2016 and then continuing to grow. And I have very little doubt that this company is going to look very, very different in 3 to 4 years from now because of the \"Change the Game.\" I hope I have answered your question.", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. And I guess before we wrap up, just to add one thing, to get back to the Rosemarie's question about cash flow, while we can't state whether it would more -- potentially more favorably impact 2015 or '16, we have implemented a special performance award program if we can exceed our cash flow that we've provided to you of $600 million in 2016, as well as exceed goals for 2015 and 2014. So we're implementing -- we've implemented a special program to incent a keen focus in the company and across the entire company to accelerate our cash flow generation, again, helping provide investment for R&D technologies and innovation, as well as to more quickly being able to hopefully delever the company as we move forward and return value to shareholders. And that is referenced in our proxy.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Operator, I'll pass the call back to you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

My name is Sue, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com. I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and these reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 9:30 today. Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. At this point, I'm sure you had the chance to carefully review our second quarter earnings release, and I must admit that I'm happy to see how we are assembling the product. Our financial performance in the quarter is yet another data point that gives us confidence that our strategy is working, an important data point, as this is our best adjusted quarter ever -- adjusted EBITDA quarter ever. We are improving the quality of earnings and continuously implementing new disciplines to expand margins and increase cash flow, but this strategy is not just about the financials. It is also about becoming a knowledge-based company. It is about changing the culture, changing our go-to-market strategy, and ultimately, delivering the most value-added and innovative solutions, which make our customers win. A significant step in making this happen is to create a stronger, one-company culture.", "As I shared with you last week, we announced plans to relocate our global headquarters to a state-of-the-art, environmentally sustainable facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. We will be moving our 3 divisions, R&D facilities and our corporate offices into a single location, and within 3 years, we expect to have about 1,300 employees in our new global campus. This move should not be considered as an isolated initiative. It is part of our \"Change the Game\" puzzle that we continue to successfully assemble. We have resolutely focused on our pricing and working capital initiatives that I first discussed with you back in the first quarter of 2013. We expected to see results towards the end of the year, and we did. At our Analyst Day in September of last year, we talked about creating a one-company culture, and with that objective in mind, we presented our new vision, mission, values and our new modern logo, the Trillian. You would be surprised how this new culture is making inroads in the company. And the move to the new campus must be seen in that light, a determined goal to unite our culture across divisions and functions, to dramatically increase innovation, new business models and collaboration, gain efficiencies and actually accelerate change, all of these for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Let me now focus on our discussion on the second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, Carol and I will open for the -- up the call for your questions.", "So on Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the second quarter. I will highlight sales trends on a constant dollar basis as compared to last year. Latin America and AMAT continue to be our fastest-growing regions, with growth of 8% and 7%, respectively. In Latin America, the 8% growth did not compensate for the currency devaluation, as our raw material costs are priced in U.S. dollar equivalent, and therefore, we're continuing our pricing efforts in the third and fourth quarter. Additionally, we lost 30% of our sales in Venezuela in second quarter, which should not be a surprise to many of you. In AMAT, China delivered 13% currency sales growth -- constant currency sales growth, with both Food Care and Product Care reporting double-digit growth due to strong demand for our new products and increased market penetration. Diversey Care also had very solid performance, with nearly double-digit growth as a result of our continued focus on food service and hospitality markets.", "North America sales were up 3%, with favorable price/mix in each of our 3 divisions. And in Europe, we delivered a slight increase in sales. France reported a 2.5% growth. Spain was up slightly and the U.K. and Holland were essentially unchanged. But this was offset by declines in Italy, Germany and Switzerland, and bear in mind that these 7 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 22% of second quarter sales. Russia and Poland delivered strong performance, with 15% and 8% constant currency growth, respectively. Sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand increased 2%, led by a 3% increase in Australia, partially offset by a 4% decline in New Zealand, and this decline was due to our decision to exit the low-margin business in the Food Care division.", "On Slide 5, we outline our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had constant currency sales growth in every division and in every region. We have made significant progress with our pricing initiatives and new disciplines across our division, with a 4.6% positive price/mix in Food Care, 1.9% in Diversey Care and 3% in Product Care. On a regional basis, we had favorable price/mix in all regions except Europe, where unfavorable mix offset a positive price due to the subdued economy throughout the volume -- throughout Western Europe.", "Turning to Slide 6, and moving to Food Care. Sales increased 4% in constant dollars, with approximately 3% growth in packaging and 6% growth in hygiene. We had 10% growth in the developing regions. Latin America and AMAT continued to be our fastest-growing regions, with strong demand for our innovative products and solutions. Japan, Australia and New Zealand sales were up approximately 2%, with almost 5% growth in Australia, offset by what I already talked about, which was the 3% decline in New Zealand.", "In North America, cattle and hog slaughter rates were down approximately 5% each in the second quarter. We have seen signs of herd rebuilding in cattle due to declining feedstocks and favorable pastures. We anticipate beef production to continue declining into the second half of the year. Third quarter could potentially be the trough of the cycle, as evidenced with very recent publications of the July slaughter rates in the U.S. Keep in mind, this trend is positive for the beef cycle over the long term, and hog slaughters is also anticipated to continue declining in the coming months, with some industry experts suggesting that it will subside in the fourth quarter. Despite these unfavorable market trends in North America, we were able to outperform the market, and deliver just over 2% constant currency sales growth, with favorable price/mix, better pricing and new product introductions.", "In Europe, our constant dollar sales increased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Our business in Europe benefit from the 3% growth in the poultry market and a relatively flat beef and pork market. The European economy appears to be stabilizing, but the lack of GDP growth and essentially flat protein market continues to make it a challenging business environment. With that said, we had, again, favorable price/mix cost spread in the quarter. I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the second quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $159 million or 16.6% of net sales increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely attributable to price increases and adoption of our innovative product portfolio. Our focus on value-added selling has been, and will continue to be, a tremendous effort within Food Care. Despite the anticipated challenges in Q3 related to PED virus and cattle slaughter rate, we are still anticipating EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.", "On Slide 7, we highlight the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3%. Developing region increased 9%, with 15% growth in Latin America, 10% growth in Eastern European countries and 6% growth in AMAT. We delivered low single-digit growth in Southern Europe. And while one quarter doesn't set a trend, I must admit that the performance in Southern Europe it starts to become encouraging. Despite a tough year-on-year comparable in North America, constant currency sales were up 1% there, with growth in the U.S. offset by a decline in Canada.", "And while we continue to focus our customer rationalization and realigning our cost structure, we're also making targeted investments in both sales and marketing and product development that will further differentiate Diversey Care in the marketplace. And despite the targeted spend, we delivered 12.4% EBITDA margins in the second quarter. Going forward, we still expect EBITDA margins expansion for the full year in 2014, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of this business and additional cost reductions that should positively impact the fourth quarter.", "And now turning to Slide 8. Product Care delivered 3% constant currency sales growth, with variable price/mix of 3% and on essentially flat volume. Constant currency sales growth in North America increased 5%, which was partially offset by a 2% decline in Europe. Similar to last quarter, we continued to see an increased demand for our e-commerce and third-party logistic customers for our packaging systems and cushioning solutions. Growth in this higher performance solutions was partially offset by a slight decline in general use, and sales in general use was impacted by rationalization and the lackluster economic environment in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% to $71 million, or 17.3% of net sales. This is a 180-basis-point improvement compared to last year. The margin improvement is a direct result of the repricing actions on some of our products, especially foams and bubbles and mailers in North America and Europe. The Product Care teams focuses -- continues to focus on pricing discipline and getting paid for the value that they deliver, to allow for reinvestment in the future growth opportunities and innovation. And as we look ahead, volumes in Product Care will be negatively impacted by product rationalization. However, we expect to offset these declines with increased demand for our higher performance packaging solutions. Our packaging systems and cushioning product portfolio are designed to minimize freight cost, reduce damage cost and improve the consumer experience. And now let me turn the call over to Carol to review our net sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow and outlook. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis, starting with the net sales bridge on Slide 9. Positive price/mix of $66 million in the quarter was offset by a slight decline in volume of $8 million. Unfavorable currency translation of $22 million was mostly due to currency weakness in Argentina, Brazil, Australia and Turkey.", "Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $284 million or 14.4% of net sales. We delivered a 50-basis-point improvement in gross profit margin and a 90-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin. And within Food Care and Product Care, we had both gross margin and EBITDA margin expansion. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to a favorable mix and price cost spread of $37 million. Cost synergies of $25 million were more than offset by $33 million of higher SG&A and other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was also negatively impacted by $4 million of unfavorable currency.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42, as compared to $0.35 in the second quarter last year. As anticipated, the tax rate of 29.5% increased compared to last year, primarily due to the lapse of certain U.S. tax laws, including the research and development credit, as well as realizing greater earnings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions with higher tax rate.", "Now turning to Slide 11. Let's look at our free cash flow. Free cash flow, excluding the $930 million payment under the Grace settlement agreement made in February, was the source of $112 million. This compares favorably to a source of $9 million in the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, partially due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Our operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, improved from 20% at June 30, 2013, to 18% at June 30, 2014. Our CapEx was $55 million, and cash restructuring costs were $50 million for the 6 month period. Cash payments related to SARs were $17 million in the first 6 months of 2014, compared with $28 million same period last year.", "Turning to Slide 12. We have updated our debt maturity schedule post the recent refinancing of our credit facility. Last Friday, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities, including repayment of the outstanding Term Loan B. The amended and restated facility provided for the refinancing of the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving facilities. The company's new facilities, totaling $2.1 billion, are comprised of $1.3 billion of Term Loan A facilities and $700 million of revolving commitments. The company also established a new $100 million delayed-draw, Term Loan A facility. The amended and restated facility will provide approximately $15 million of annualized interest savings, in addition to maturity extension, more covenant flexibility and an increase in our restricted payment basket.", "Turning to Slide 13. Let's highlight our updated guidance for the year. Based on our performance in the first and second quarters and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2014 guidance. For net sales, we estimate approximately $7.75 billion. This is a $50 million increase from previously provided guidance. It assumes an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately 1% from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70, as compared to the previously provided guidance of $1.50 to $1.60. The increased outlook for adjusted earnings per share is due to higher estimated adjusted EBITDA, plus lower interest expense in the second half of the year and a reduction in our shares outstanding. During the quarter, we completed a share repurchase of $130 million or approximately 3.9 million shares. We are still estimating the full year tax rate to be approximately 27%.", "Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of approximately $1.085 billion to $1.095 billion, an increase from our prior guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion. We still expect full year adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our 3 divisions as compared to 2013. The other category, which includes our medical and new ventures business and our corporate and unallocated cost, is now expected to be approximately $90 million of net cost, which is essentially in line with 2013. Our estimate for depreciation and amortization of $315 million remains unchanged. We are increasing our free cash flow outlook to approximately $485 million from $425 million, reflecting our higher EBITDA range, combined with lower CapEx, lower restructuring cost and reduced cash interest payments. We are now estimating capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million, due to the timing of certain projects moving from late Q4 into early 2015. For cash restructuring costs, we anticipate approximately $135 million, as the timing of execution of certain programs can be uncertain.", "Cash interest payments are estimated to be approximately $7 million lower than our previous estimate of $280 million, as a result of the savings from the amended and restated credit facility. As you know, we are extremely focused on free cash flow generation and have initiatives in place to drive sustainable improvements in working capital, earnings growth and margin expansion. In our 2014 proxy, we highlighted that the board approved a special PSU award program, targeted at supporting the generation of increased cash flow. This program includes executive officers and a broader group of employees. For the special PSU award, we set a 3-year cumulative free cash flow goal for 2014, '15 and '16 to exceed $1.7 billion. The $1.7 billion excludes the $200 million tax refund we expect to receive in mid-2015 related to the Grace settlement. For the special PSU grant to be paid out, we must achieve our free cash flow goal and meet other metrics, including minimum earnings per share, working capital levels and total shareholder return. We continue to evaluate our total cost structure, and any additional cost reduction opportunities identified over the coming months are not expected to have a negative impact on our 3-year cumulative free cash flow goal of exceeding $1.7 billion.", "To conclude my remarks, I would like to reiterate Jerome's excitement regarding the opportunities ahead. We are delivering on our commitment in staying focused on driving financial and operational excellence. We look forward to speaking with you again at our third quarter earnings conference call, which is tentatively scheduled for October 29 at 8:30 a.m.", "Operator, can you please open up the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sorry, I jumped on a little bit late, you might have mentioned this earlier. My question is a little bit more top-down and away from the businesses, and it relates to the headquarters move. How much in savings do you expect to accrue from the move to new headquarters from the other facilities? Why couldn't you have accomplished whatever goals you're trying to achieve with this move in Elmwood Park, which is a relatively new facility as well, guys? And what's the deeper mission associated with this move?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thanks, George, good to hear you. And you missed, as you said, the earlier comments, because I explained the rationale of this move as part of our initiatives. And it is not an isolated initiative. It's just -- it's a whole plan to increase employee collaboration, to have -- to decrease the barriers between our divisions and our functions and add -- more than reduce costs. So today, you know very well that our headquarter are in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, that we have one product head -- one division, which is the Product Care division in Mayhew, New Jersey, that we have our Diversey Care in Amsterdam, that we have our Food Care division in South Carolina. We don't have one company here. We have -- if I push it, we have 3 companies. And when you bear in mind that you have R&D in their own facilities, and that we have scattered around the world some other parts of those divisions, then you understand that we can do much better. What I want is to offer our employees growth opportunities across divisions, across functions. I want a very collaborated environment, which is going to accelerate our \"Change the Game\" initiatives. So then the next question is why North Carolina? Because North Carolina is a good place to work from. It has a good airport. It has a good climate, it has a young population. It has affordable cost of living. It has proper local taxes. It has a good talent pool. It has lots of young people, and that makes it a very good place for us. We have had some support from the North Carolina government and this has helped the decision, but it is the whole things which I just talked about which are important. We need -- we are expecting cost synergies as a result of being all of us together, but it is not so much that. It is about being one, and my theme inside the company was the beginning of one company, the power of one.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty, CS.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So with regard to pricing, you clearly are getting some solid traction, it looks like pricing, or price/mix at least, accelerated in pretty much all the packaging businesses and a little bit of -- on the Diversey side as well. Do you feel that there's more room to go or are we plateauing here in terms of maybe extracting the value from -- for your products from your customers? How should we think about that going forward?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So I must admit I'm really pleased with this change in culture in the company. We are making huge progress, and there is a little bit of mix, but there's a lot of price. When you look at our Product Care division, we have said that in North America, we have 5% price/mix growth. Well, 4% of the 5% are price alone. And this is with volume, which in fact, did not decline, because we have a 10-basis-points volume reduction in North America. So you compare the 4% price and the 0.1% volume reduction in an environment where volume, in general, has not been very favorable, and you just see here a very simple example of how we're doing in pricing. And we're doing the same in every single region, because including in Europe, we had positive, we had about 1% price alone in Europe on Product Care. So it shows that it is about discipline. It is about who you want to be, and it is about creating the real value for our customers, but being respected for the value that we create. So when we move, you move to other type of businesses, Diversey Care is -- we have a little bit less of that, but it is still strong, and the reason why it's not like this is that what we are doing is that we're eliminating some bleeders and low-quality businesses, replacing them by better ones. But those are, generally speaking, contracts that we have with our customers, and it takes a little bit of time to do that. On Food Care, Food Care is very strong. We talked about price/mix in North America of 3.4%, and the total price/mix of 4.6% in the division, with just price in North America is 3%. And same for the rest of the world, where we have, in total, almost 4% price alone in that division. The volume in North America is slightly down, but much less down than the mega trends that we have been observed with the PED virus and with the beef cycle. Actually, in the third quarter, we believe that the beef cycle is going to continue to be down. If I have further questions in the queue, I will elaborate on that. So now the question is what's next? Well, we're not done. We're not done. We believe that we need to continue to recoup some price/mix and we've made major progress. Well, I think we have made major progress when you look at this. But we are going to be very attentive to optimize our pricing, and we believe that we can do further progress. Over the mid-term, you've seen how much we have accomplished. In the past, we had a 13% EBITDA, 13.1% EBITDA in the first half of last year. We have 14% -- 14.1% EBITDA in the first half of this year, and we are intending to continue this progression in the future, and you have seen in our Investor Day our progress in -- and our targets for 2015 or 2016, and we're pretty dedicated to achieve those.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi, Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Jerome, on the sales guidance increase for 2014, can you just give us some more color on the various components there? Are the beef and pork production issues less severe than you initially thought? Are you losing less market share than you perhaps thought you might as part of your bleeder initiative, if you will? And if you can also touch on the competitive behavior you're seeing both in Food and Protective Care as a function of the price increases you're leading in the market?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Okay, so the guidance is, actually for the rest of the year, and therefore for the second half, is more guided towards the fourth quarter. Half of our division is Food Care, and what we've seen from official data is that the slaughter rates in beef are just -- I don't, know what adjective to use, year-to-date in beef, it is 6.8% down. And the slaughter rates are week-by-week since the third week of June, are minus 7, minus 11.8, minus 10 and last week was minus 11.6. So it just shows you that the slaughter rate is worsening, and this is why you heard in my prepared remarks that I believe that the -- we're probably going to reach the trough -- not probably, I believe that we're going to reach the trough in the third quarter. The pork rate slaughter rates are exactly the same, year-to-date, minus 4.7, and in the past few weeks, we reached minus 8.8, minus 9, minus 8.9. So that again is why I talked about the trough. So that's why in that environment, we're doing extremely well. We're doing -- we're continuing to progress in Food Care. We're going to -- we're continuing to progress in every single of those divisions and our, in staying with Food Care, our poultry business is doing quite well and globally and including in the U.S. When you move to Product Care, the packaging systems business is doing extremely well, and our general use is a little bit behind. And the reason is that we've been taking some pretty steep actions on pricing, and we intend to continue doing this, because some margins were just simply unacceptable. So the important thing in Product Care is related to our dimensional weight opportunity. This change that has been announced by FedEx and by UPS in charging volume, cube and not only weight, is provoking reactions from our customers who are asking for new and different solutions, and we have great solutions. So they are proactively working on this, and we have lots of conversations with many customers. And there might be some cannibalization out of some of our commodity type of product, lower value to some more performance packaging products, and we're working on this.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Al Kabili, Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "Jerome, I just wanted to follow on Ghansham's question, I guess, on the outlook. And it sounds like from your outlook that you see, and it's good to see it raise, but it sounds like you see sort of more moderate year-over-year EBITDA growth in the back half of the year versus what you experienced in the first half. And you mentioned some of the issues in North America on the Food Care side, but some of those issues were also still happening in the first half. Are you seeing anything else incrementally that sort of tempers that growth that you see in the back half from an earnings perspective, because it sounds like there's a lot of things happening positively on the price and cost side still?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So the market is what it is, and we are -- I consider that we're beating the market and we're leading where we have to lead. You're correct when you say that the first half EBITDA of last year was at 13.1%, and we are -- we have delivered 14.1% in the first half of this year. The second half EBITDA was 13.9%, and we are projecting 14.1% or so or close to that, and therefore, you see that the delta is less incremental, but you have to look at the comps. We had announced some -- and implemented some steep price increases in the -- from November 1 last year, and we were very successful at those. So the comp is a little bit more difficult in there. Having said that, the sales growth is -- was 1.7% in the first half, and we're planning it at 1.2% in the second half. So yes, we are a little bit prudent with what we're seeing in the U.S. PED virus and in the beef cycle slaughter rates for the third quarter, but we're pretty confident in ending what I would call a pretty strong year, above plan. Carol might have something to add. Any comments, Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Al, I think the relevant point is, as Jerome highlighted, as we move into the back half, especially Q4, we do have some difficult year-over-year comps because of a lot of actions that were taken last year and the references to the growth that we're expecting on the organic side, we do expect to still see second half growth, but we will continue to have some rationalization, especially with the keen focus with Product Care on some of the more general use type products, and switching our value investments and focus on the higher value products, but we will continue. What we always say is a good measure of quality of performance is if your EBITDA growth rate is exceeding your top line growth rate. We had strong performance in the first half for that for 2014 and for the full -- for second half and for the full year, our EBITDA growth rate will be significantly higher than our top line growth rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo.", "Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "This is Gabe, on for Chris. First question revolves around the CapEx guidance, and I appreciate that sometimes projects get pushed out. But can you talk about what level of spending that you think is necessary kind of to support increased customer penetration or new product introduction, stuff like that? And if there's any spending incorporated into next year for the corporate move.", "Carol P. Lowe", "So the -- I'll address the corporate move first. The -- over a 3-year period, the net cash outflow is expected to be less than $20 million, and so it is not a material impact, and that's over a full 3-year period. And we do expect, on a net present value basis, longer term, we will have net savings with this consolidation. But that isn't really the driver. It's all the reasons that Jerome highlighted previously. As it relates to the capital projects, what we have said is that, on average, if we're spending somewhere around that $170 million, $200 million or even the way we look at it is our R&D investment and our CapEx investment together, being approximately $300 million, that, that is plenty to support our strategic plans, our growth initiatives to make the right investments in the right regions, in the right solutions, and to have the innovation level that we want. We're completely comfortable with that, and it will vary from year-to-year, how much is spent, R&D, versus how much is spent from a CapEx standpoint. The Diversey Care business is very low investment from a CapEx requirement. Our supply chain team continues to do just a phenomenal job across all 3 of the divisions in managing the footprint and getting the right capital in the right places to support the growth of the business. So we really are extremely comfortable anywhere between that $150 million to $200 million from a CapEx standpoint, that we can sufficiently support the business and provide opportunity for growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Ng, Jefferies.", "Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "This is Alex Hutter, on for Phil. In Diversey, you saw good growth in volumes off a tough comp, and Europe seems to be recovering slowly. Price/mix is a little bit less of a tailwind for the top line in the first quarter. Can you talk about the moving pieces in terms of mix and price in that segment as you shed the bleeders, and should we see price/mix return to that kind of 3% range you saw in the first quarter?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Diversey Care is a different animal in terms of the way you build contracts and things like this. So we need to be a little bit careful on this. So we had a total price/mix of 1.9%, 2% in the second quarter. That is slightly less than the 3.2% of last year. In North America, we have slightly more than that, and we're quite pleased with this. And again, we have several sectors down there in Diversey Care. We have BSE, food service, hospitality, health care, retail, channel and all of these, and therefore, one size doesn't fit all. What I -- what is very clear is that we're very focused on eliminating low-quality customers. And when we come to bidding, we just change -- we're not hesitant to do that, as it was the case before. I have no issue with losing customers, provided they don't contribute. And we have seen some of that in the past, and actually, every time we have lost one, which would have low return, and passed that on to our competitors, we just went back and just took some other more value-add customers. That's the game.", "Carol P. Lowe", "And Alex, if I could add to that, one thing that is important, we've emphasized with Diversey Care that in terms of rightsizing the support structure to match with the revenues and where our focus is at, it does -- it has a little bit more of a lag than the Food Care business and the Product Care business at times. I would like to note for the second quarter that the Diversey Care team, they did a great job identifying certain businesses that they needed to exit because of the margins. And if you look specifically at the adjusted EBITDA bridge, you'll see that the volume reduction that we had on the top line, actually, although slight, it did positively contribute to improve total EBITDA dollars for the division for the quarter. So Ilham and the team, again, they continue to be focused on making sure we have the right match and cost structure and support, and that they can put a lot of their resources and investments towards innovation for the business. And as we've also noted, towards the latter half of 2014, we do expect to see the benefit of some of the cost reduction activities that the division is taking. So we're really pleased with the progress that they're making and the strategic plan that they have laid out for the entire business going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "I have a couple of questions that just sort of relate to the cash flow in the next few years. One is, if you sort of look at where you started, how much more working capital cash squeeze do you think you still have? What kind of opportunities do you have there? And then, I guess, secondly, could you just talk about sort of the timing of when you were going to move the divisions from, I guess, their various locations, including the headquarters to the Charlotte campus? Is that next year or will that phase in over a few years?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So let me start with that, and let me start, Chip, with your second question, so the timing of this move. So first, we're going to build the campus. That's going to take 2 years. So we already have a nice party organized for the Christmas of '16 in this campus. I want to celebrate that. I already invited the governor and our board. And of course, first, our employees, who are going to be unbelievably proud. In my career, I have seen what the benefits of a campus can be, and they are amazing. When you put everybody in functions and in businesses together, that's a huge difference with centralization by the way. But when you put the key people who can benefit from collaboration together, you have collaboration. It's extraordinary to see. So when is this going to happen? I said in, the new building, towards the third, fourth quarter of '16. In the meantime, we're going to organize waves of people moving, and we already have determined waves. And we're going to move into temporary offices. So that's how it's going to be working. With regards to cash flow, Carol made a comment on the special incentive, which is in the proxy that we published last April, without too much details. But she gave you a number, $1.7 billion is the threshold. And if we reach $1.7 billion of free cash flow for the years '14, '15 and '16, the payout is 0. So it is from there that it starts to pay there. So it is extremely important that we understand that, and the reason why there is a special incentive is to stretch our people to go and do that. So we're making huge progress on working capital as a percentage of net sales. Carol is going to give you some details, but we believe there is more. We moved from 20% in the first half of last year to 18%, and our goal is to continue making progress in there. We are not tolerating bad news. We are not tolerating bad debts, and those kind of things, and we already -- we had $212 million at December of 2012 as bad news. I come from a culture where this is a no-no, and we have a moral contract with our customers, and this moral contract is I deliver on quality, on time, you pay on time, and there's nothing special about these kind of things. Carol, you want to add something?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So Chip, at the end of June this year, we have -- still have $1.4 billion invested in working capital, simple operating working capital, so your trade receivables, plus your inventory less your payables. So there's still opportunity. We've made great year-over-year improvement. Our DSO is down 3 days versus June of 2013. Our DPOs have improved by 2 days. Inventory days on hand has improved by 2 days. However, we've made the improvement on the past dues, but we still had approximately $140 million past-due outstanding at the end of June. So there's still opportunity there. We have a lot of key initiatives underway, with great focus, cross functional focus, full business support in terms of sales and operations planning, SKU optimization, simplification. So we feel like there's still very meaningful opportunity for us from a working capital standpoint, but the other thing to keep in mind is our -- while we're very focused on this and we believe that being at 18% working capital as a percent of net trade sales, we still got a long ways to go to get to world-class. And Sealed Air has that potential to have world-class working capital metrics. So again, the focus in addition to working capital, we will continue to have quality of earnings, which means expanding our EBITDA, expanding our EBITDA margin. That will also greatly contribute to free cash flow. So we feel like we still have tremendous opportunity. The board did set a stretch goal for the company in exceeding $1.7 billion, but we're very focused on it, because it benefits our ability to reinvest in the company, as well as return value to shareholders.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "It really is, interesting comment that Carol made here, is that when you compare us with many other companies, most companies today, after the global crisis in the last 4 years, are at peak margins, and that's not our case. We believe, and we know that we are not at peak margins. We have proven that we are progressing and we're -- I'm confirming that we have ways to go and to improve our margins. So our cash flow is not going to only come from squeezing. It is going to come from eliminating the waste where we have waste, and we have made huge progress on this, but it is also going to come from improving our margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.", "Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Usha Guntupalli on behalf of Alex. Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one quick one. So given your focus on pricing for some time now, have you seen competitor and/or customer behaviors toward price change materially? And specifically, have you had any customers you lost initially because of price come back to you for your value proposition?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So that is a very good question, because what we -- there is always the gaining and losing of customers, and sometimes it is about price. Sometimes it is about something else. And let me assure you that we are also gaining customers based on price, not because of we reducing prices, but because of the value proposition. I cannot repeat enough to you what I've been saying internally, is that our #1 job, our #2 job, our #3 job, is to be obsessed with helping our customers win. That is, and I word the word obsessed, because I want every single of our people to understand that this is our job and only our job. And -- but this does not mean that making our customers win should go through price reduction. Actually, I'm asking our people to make sure that we are respected by our customers for the value that we create to them, and it is common practice to -- and obvious, to say that customers choose their suppliers, all right? Well, what I'm telling them, our people internally also is choose your customers, and you need to make sure that you are happy with your customer mix. That if you only deal with the pricing driven customer, you are never going to get there. Because for those of us who are pricing seekers, we are never satisfied. The minute we find a cheaper price, we want another cheaper price. So I want our people to choose better their customers, and we're achieving this. So to cut the story short, are we losing business? Yes, we are. Are we winning business? Yes, we are. Are we losing business then because of our pricing? Very little. Look at what we have been doing in our Product Care division, which had the biggest pricing repositioning of recent time. North America, we had 4% price in the second quarter. Our volume in North America is minus 0.1%, and I don't think the market has been positive in the whole of protective packaging world in the second quarter. And as a result of that, it's just to prove that we can be respected for the value we create. And it's the same in the Food Care. I don't think that we have lost share. Actually, we might pretty well have gained share in the -- in all kind of packaging and also beverage businesses, and we're doing pretty well. Because when you look at our volume, again in North America, as an example, we have lost 1% in volume, but our pricing only in North America has been 3%. And in Europe, we gained volume in Food Care, and we gained price. So I think this is just a proof of what's going on in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of John McNulty, CS.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I had a question regarding your cash flow. So your cash flow, it looks like if you pull out the restructuring charges, you're pretty much already at your 2016 target. So it looks like things are going well there. I guess, can you walk us through, I guess, first of all, if you think there's upside to that target or if we kind of plateau on the free cash flow generation here? And then also, how to think about the uses for that? I know it sounds like you freed up some ability to buy back more stock around the credit refinancing, but maybe an update there as to how much you can buy back now, and then also what kind of -- which pieces of debt you may be able to take out with some of the cash that you're generating over the next 12 months as well?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Okay. Thank you, John. So obviously, the $1.7 billion, exceeding that amount over that 3-year period ending 2016 with our current outlook for 2014 at $485 million, it definitely would imply that the 2016 target that we shared of $600 million on our Analyst Day, that we would exceed that. We would need to exceed it, and so you can kind of estimate the math in between. We're not going to provide 2015 numbers now or specifically update the 2016 amounts that we provided at Analyst Day, but obviously, it has to be higher than $600 million for us to exceed $1.7 billion. In terms of the uses for the cash, we've been really clear that we do have a goal of returning value to shareholders, which we have defined, in addition to the company performing better, having higher earnings, making the right investments. So we do have the quality growth for the company that investors seek. We also want the opportunity, as we move below 4x leverage, that we look at our dividends, as well as potential share repurchases. We did have the Q2 share repurchase from the Grace trust. Right now, with the refinancing of our credit facility, that was our limitation before, because we can only repurchase approximately $150 million worth under the restricted payment basket once we took out what we pay in dividends. With the refinancing of those facilities, they are no longer the limitation from a restricted payment basket. It's actually our senior notes or bonds. And right now, based on those limitations for the basket, it's approximately $200 million a year. Based on what we've already executed, we could do an additional $70 million this year if we had the right opportunity. When we look -- but there were some carryover from last year. If we look at 2015, that basket is probably limited to around $80 million that we could do in 2015. However, we've also been very clear that we would be opportunistic, and we would consider possible activities or market transactions that would alleviate that current restriction. But again, we'll be opportunistic. It has to be the right timing. It has to be the right returns for investment. And our leverage, still we're not within that 3.5 to 4 range that we're ready to move ahead right this minute with something, but it is definitely on our list, and we'll respond as we believe is appropriate for the company and for our investors.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you.

We also generated $354 million in free cash flow in the first nine months of the year and as a result of third quarter performance we raising our full year forecast for adjusted EBIT, earnings per share and free cash flow despite a tough protein, uncertain macro-environment and currency headwinds.", "Our execution so far in 2014 is a direct result of our commitment to improving the operations at every level of the this organization reimagining Sealed Air and the trends that we have seen and expect to see and what we expect to see is very encouraging.", "Before Carol provides you with a detailed discussion on the numbers I wanted to update you on a few things. First I wanted to make you aware that for the first time we are hosting our quarterly earnings call from our temporary site in Charlotte and as you know Charlotte will become the home of our new state of the art global corporate headquarters.", "We look forward to taking this significant step in creating a stronger, one company culture.", "Second I would like to highlight our recent recognition by CDP also known as Carbon Disclosure Project. Sealed Air was named to CDP's Climate Disclosure leadership's index where our transparency and reporting scored 97 out of 100 points which puts us in the top 10% of S&P companies. We also scored an A- on our performance in achieving energy efficiency and reduction in CO2 emissions. These are Sealed Air's best ratings to-date and is significantly improved over last year's scores. And integral part of our sustainability strategy is focused on reducing our own and our customer's carbon footprint and providing solutions to help drive that -- that helped drive in a sustainable economy.", "This underscores our commitment as a world leader in sustainability and supports our company vision which is to create a better way for life.

And Ken will join us on our first quarter earnings call in 2015 alongside Carol and me.", "For today's call we have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of our Diversey Care Division to provide you with a detailed update on Diversey Care. Under Ilham's leadership the Diversey Care team has made significant progress despite the challenging, the economy challenges in Europe which is Diversey Care's largest market.", "Ilham will also highlight, food care and product care's performance and at the conclusion of our prepared remarks Carol, Ilham and myself will be available for questions.", "With that let's start with an overview of the financial results. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you Jerome. On slide 4 of our presentation you can see our performance by region for the second quarter. I will highlight sales trends on a constant dollar basis as compared to last year unless otherwise noted. Latin America and AMAT continued to be our fastest growing regions with constant dollar growth of 8% and 7% respectively. Given the currency devaluation of Latin America our as reported sales were essentially flat compared to last year. Brazil and Mexico were up approximately 10% and both constant currency and as reported future growth in both food care and Diversey Care.", "For the AMAT region China and India delivered 6% and 15% constant currency growth respectively. China was driven by double-digit growth and Diversey Care and mid-single-digit growth in food care and product care. Strength in India was primarily attributable to Diversey Care and our food hygiene business. North America sales were up 3% compared to last year led by 6% growth in product care. Both Food Care and Diversey Care increased sales in North America by 2%. In Europe we delivered a 1% increase in sales. The UK reported 5% growth and France, Germany and Spain were essentially unchanged.", "This was offset by declines in Italy, Switzerland and Holland. The seven countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 21% of third quarter consolidated sales. Russia and Poland delivered 9% and 6% constant currency sales growth respectively. Sales in Japan Australia and New Zealand increased 5% primarily driven by a 5% increase in Australia and a 3% increase in New Zealand. While our business in Japan is still relatively small our product care division has been performing well with double-digit growth for the third consecutive quarter.", "Turning to slide 5 and 6, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBIT performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales on slide 5, we delivered $2 billion in sales an increase of 3.1% on an as reported basis and 3.6% in constant currency. Favorable price mix was 3.1% or $59 million. Volume increased $9 million or 50 basis points. Unfavorable currency translation of $4 million was mostly due to the currency weakness in Argentina, Turkey and Canada.", "Now turning to slide 6, for the quarter, adjusted EBIT increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $300 million or 15.2% of net sales. For the total company the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $31 million and a $5 million increase in volume.", "Cost synergies were $24 million in the quarter. SG&A and other expenses increased by $36 million of which $12 million was attributable to an increase in incentives performance-based compensation and $11 million was related to salary inflation.", "We delivered a 120 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 70 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to last year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52 as compared to $0.42 in the third quarter last year.", "As we anticipated the tax rate of 27.8% increased as compared to last year primarily due to greater earnings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions with higher tax rates and the lapse of certain U.S. tax laws including the research and development credit. Beginning in September and as of yesterday's clothes we have repurchased approximately 800,000 shares for a total value of approximately $27 million.", "As a reminder our target EBITDA leverage ratio is 3.5 to 4 times. We continue to evaluate alternatives and are now evaluating our alternatives that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders and maintain our target leverage. On slide 7, we outline our price mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region.", "As you can see from the slide we had constant currency sales growth and favorable price mix in every division and in every region. Food Care has had solid performance despite the challenges in the protein market in North America and Europe and both Diversey Care and Product Care have been gaining momentum throughout the year.", "For three consecutive quarters the year-over-year growth trends in net sales have improved on an as reported basis and in constant currency. I will now turn the call over to Ilham Kadri, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Diversey Care results and a recap of Food Care and Product Care. Ilham?", "Ilham Kadri", "Thank you Carol and good morning everyone. Slide 8, highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on constant currency basis were up 4%. Volume was up 3.7% with a favorable price mix of 0.2%. Developing regions increased 12% Latin America was up 16%, AMAT was up 12% and Eastern European countries were up in the mid-single digits. Turkey, China and India were our fastest growing countries both as reported and in constant currency.", "We experienced increased demand in the building service contractors, food service and hospitality sectors. North America sales were up 2% in the quarter growth in the U.S. was partially offset by a slight decline in Canada. Building service contractors and hospitality were our two strongest end markets. In Europe constant currency sales were essentially unchanged.", "Positive trends in the UK, Switzerland and Spain were offset by declines in France, Holland, Italy and Germany. We experience growth in the hospitality and retail markets which was offset by declines in building service contractors and food service.", "In both local North America and Europe we are experiencing healthy demand for our floor care machines. Our business is beginning to benefit from our focus on quality value and innovation and our commitment to existing low-margin businesses.", "You may remember that we have talked about this at our Analyst Day last year. I have three examples to share with you to demonstrate our progress. First in the third quarter we completed our first multimillion dollar sale of IntelliTrail TASKI machine which is an innovative web-based a GPS system optimized for intelligence fleet management. We believe that our TASKI portfolio will be a key driver for future growth.", "Second you may recall that earlier this year we announced that we were walking away from customers in the UK that were a drain on our bottom line. Two targeted sales -- and to focus on the quality advantages we offer sales in UK increased 4% in constant currency in the third quarter as we have more than recouped the lost sales with the higher margin business.", "And third we've recently acquired Excel product line from Virox, we continue investing in differentiated disinfection [ph] technology that not only outperforms other technology but also has a much better environmental profile.", "Our emphasis on environmental and socially responsible program is being recognized by major brands in the market and we're confident that this will prove to be a competitive advantage over time.", "You can see that we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $70 million or 12.7% net sales in the quarter. Last year adjusted EBIT was negatively impacted by $3.8 million reserve related to a large customer in AMAT. Adjusting for these reserves the year-over-year increase in EBITDA would have been 8% which is a solid improvement. We are making projected investments in R&D sales and marketing and you will see some of that spend in Q4 along with some currency headwinds given our exposure to Europe.", "With all that said and Carol will provide details pertaining to our outlook we remain confident that we will deliver adjusted EBIT growth and margin expansion for the full year.", "Turning to slide 9, with Food Care sales increased 4% in constant dollars with approximately 3% growth in packaging and 4% growth in hygiene. We had 10% constant currency growth in the developing regions. Latin America and AMAT continue to be our fastest growing regions with strong demand for our innovative products and solutions.", "Both Brazil and Mexico reported approximately double-digit sales growth on as reported and constant currency basis. Japan and Australia and New Zealand constant currency sales were up approximately 5%. In Europe the protein markets was relatively flat.", "Our constant dollar net sales increased to 2% on year-over-year basis. Volumes were up just over 1% and price mix was slightly favorable. On a constant dollar basis double-digit growth in the UK and Russia and positive trends in France were partially offset by declines in Spain, Italy, and Germany. In North America cattle and hog slaughter rates were down approximately 10% and 5% compared to last year.", "Despite these market trends we were able to outperform the market and deliver approximately 2% constant currency sales growth with favorable product mix, better pricing, and new product introduction. We believe the quarter will most likely be the bottom of that the cycle.", "And the rate of decline to moderate into year and we believe that the PD virus [ph] is now largely behind us and we expect the hog production decline to moderate in the fourth quarter.", "It's worth noting that despite volume declines in the beef markets in North America and the soft economy environment in Europe fresh red meat were up in the mid-single digits in the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year in both regions.", "The stock performances is a direct result of customer acceptance of our value added solutions including case ready, ready meal, Diversey Care and (indiscernible). Poultry has also been a key growth driver in North America and Latin America. I want to briefly highlight the EBITDA margin performance of the second quarter for food care.", "Adjusted EBIT of $178 million or 18.1% of net sales increased 11% as compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of pricing disciplines adoption of our innovative product portfolio and cost synergies. Despite the anticipated volume declines in the protein market in North America and currency headwinds in the fourth quarter we are well on track to deliver EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.", "Turning to slide 10 product scale delivered 4% constant currency sales growth with favorable price mix of 4.5% and a slight decline in volume. North America which accounts for 60% of our product care business increased sales 6%. Europe was flat with last year and accounted for just over 20% of our product scale sales.", "Constant currency same growth in Germany was offset by declines in the UK, France and Italy. In AMAT it's worth noting that we have's double-digit growth in Japan and high single-digit growth in China. Similar to last quarter growth in our higher performance solutions including cushioning and packaging systems were driven by an increase in demand from our e-commerce and third-party logistics customers. I want to briefly highlight the recent market introduction of the -- system presents the first truly mobile instant back platform.", "Capable of delivering the damage reduction and optimization benefits that are increasingly demanded by the growing e-commerce market segment, that makes the it's a pack several system so valuable to the e-commerce is also stimulating significant demand in our targeted global emerging markets.", "In just a few months we're seeing a strong pipeline global customers and expect this to be a key growth driver going forward.", "Adjusted EBIT increased 7% to $74 million also -- or 17.7% of net sales. The margin improvements is a -- of the pricing actions and discipline in North America and Europe practical our general business. Despite some of the pricing and product actions we have taken in our general use business we had positive trends in the third quarter with an improvement in the contribution margin. In product scale we expect to deliver EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.", " Let me now review cash flow and Outlook. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you Ilham. Turning to slide 11 free cash flow excluding the $930 million payment under the grace settlement agreement made in February this year was a source of $354 million and the first nine months of 2014. This compares favorably to a source of $154 million in the nine months ending 2013 due to higher earnings and improvement in operating working capital management.", "Operating working capital as a percent of net sales improved from 20% at September 30, 2013 to 16% at September 30, 2014. CapEx was $94 million in cash restructuring costs were $76 million in the nine months ending September 30. Cash payments related to SAR S were $18 million in the nine months entering September 24 as compared to $43 million in the prior-year period.", "Turning to slide 12 our updated guidance for 2014. Based on our performance on a year-to-date basis and our Outlook into year and we are revising our full-year 2014 guidance. The net sales we estimate approximately $7.7 billion which assumes an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately 2% or $160 million from foreign currency translation.", "We most recently guided to an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 as compared to the previously provided guidance of $1.65 to $1.70. The increased Outlook for adjusted earnings per share is due to higher estimated adjusted EBIT.. It's anticipated to be approximately $1.11 billion an increase from our prior guidance of one point of $1.085 billion to 1.059 to $1.059 billion. We still expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our three divisions as compared to 2013. The impact on EBIT from an unfavorable foreign currency translation is expected to be approximately $25 million for the full year of rich approximately $11 million is in the fourth quarter.", "Adjusted EBIT guidance for the other category which includes our medical and new ventures business and our corporate and unallocated cost is unchanged at approximately $90 million of net costs. We continue to evaluate our total cost structure including as appropriate the possibility for future restructuring programs. Any such programs would of course require approval by our Board of Directors.", "We would provide any related update on our Q4 earnings call and early February on any additional restructuring program such programs would be funded with the grace tax refund we expect to receive by mid-2015. We are increasing our free cash flow Outlook to approximately $540 million from $485 million reflecting our higher adjusted EBIT forecast combined with lower restructuring cash cost.", "For cash restructuring costs we anticipate approximately $100 million for 2014. You may recall that at the beginning of the year we had forecasted but hundred $50 million in cash restructuring charges for 2014. As compared to the hundred million dollars we're forecasting today. The remaining $50 million in cash payments is expected to be made in the first half of 2015. Our forecast for capital expenditures and cash interest are unchanged at $150 million and $273 million respectively. To conclude my mailbox I would like to congratulate our employees around the world for their ongoing commitment to improving the quality of earnings and the execution demonstrated in the third quarter. We plan to build on this momentum and drive continuous improvement in the years ahead.", "We look forward to speaking with you again on our first-quarter earnings conference call which is tentatively scheduled for February 10 at 8:30 AM. I would now like to open the call to Q&A session and I encourage you to focus on diversity care as we have the privilege of having -- with us today. She has done great things and has a lot of information to share with you about the strategies she is leading and the improvements she is driving so far for our Diversey Care business.", "With that operator can you please open the call for questions?", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Albert Kabili of Macquarie Research.", "Albert Kabili - Macquarie Research", "", "I'll take your suggestion Carol on the Diversey Care. Ilham can you highlight that the volume increase in Diversey Care was surprising to us especially given the macro environment in Europe so can you talk about the sustainability you see in volumes in Diversey Care and how concerned are you with the macro environment. Are you seeing any recent weakening given the data out there. Thank you.", "Ilham Kadri", "", "Indeed a good question I'm very pleased and proud of our team of which I would name is a very good quarter both in the Diversey Care side that also -- company. If you think about this the way look at it is we had started to harvest what we have done in the past two years of previous . Since 2012 we increased our EBIT percent by 120 basis points. Our organization is much more focused on quality business and is focused on quality is showing up in the numbers although we have (indiscernible) still a lot of work to do. We need customers and hospitality in healthcare.", "We are extending and building service contractors thanks to our labor productivity programs were our equipment systems. Throughout 2014 I'm sure you have noticed that year on year trends are improving. We had double-digit growth in Latin America [Technical Difficulty] growth there.", "The United States for example grew 2.8% of constant currency and Europe is further improving trends and flattish year on year which is a very good achievement as we were declining since the in Europe and in the U.S.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Carol maybe a question for you with regard to the pushing off of the restructuring program can you walk us through how we should be -- or at least the cash flows around that. Can you walk us through have we should be thinking about the timing of cost coming in and give us an update on that as we look to '15 and beyond?", "Carol Lowe", "So we started the year thinking that are synergy costs related to restructuring would be approximately $80 million. We are on track to realize $95 million and cost synergies. We had $27 million in Q3 and we expect approximately 20 21 million for Q4. So our original the program was integration and optimization program which was to generate cost synergies of $200 million versus the 2011 base. That will wrap up by the end of this year. Second, program which was our earnings quality improvement program -- that is what is tracking at a more accelerated basis with savings closer to $115 million versus our previous estimate of 90 to 100 and versus our previous estimate of 90 to 110,000,000 versus the 2012 call space.", "When we look at 2015 as our reference from cash cost for the restructuring we would expect to have approximately $50 million that we expected to spend in 2015 that we will spend in the first half -- of 2014 that will spend in the first half of 2015. As we reprioritize our projects for 2014 we've concentrated on the higher returning projects first and that has resulted in some of the projects being pushed out a little bit into 2015. But again we are on track for that level savings for the equipped program which is what you'll see a lot of in 2015, savings of $115 million versus the 90 the $90-$110 million.", "Operator", "The next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "What gives you the most confidence in your free cash flow guidance of the next couple of years and in particular how does Diversey Care contribute to that what's made you more comfortable about the diversity contribution to cash. Thanks.", "Carol Lowe", "With respect to free cash flow we definitely have a key focus on our working capital management that's been a significant contributor. We've been very open and vocal about our improvement in terms of DSOs reducing past dues. We also are actively managing our inventory through our sales and operations planning process and that is generated a lot of the cash flow that you've seen today too. Also our continued discipline around the quality of earnings is providing the EBITDA which we see sitting in our cash flow and all three of the businesses are contributing to that improvement. So and diversity care has had strong cash flow and we expect them to continue to have strong cash flow with what ill health is driving in terms of the disciplines and the focus that she commented on our Diversey Care we continue to expect them to deliver on free cash flow as we move forward. Jerome do you want to add anything? You might want to talk about rationalization customer rationalization.", "Jerome Peribere", "I think you say obviously we had made a great progress in Diversey Care under the DSO basis and looking at our low-margin businesses both from the -- we need to choose our customers as well and we need to pay premium for our breakthrough and innovative technologies. We are having as we speak a big SKU program because we have a big sale. Our business is about managing complexity but the 8020 will applies to our business and to our technologies and we are as we speak building up that -- optimization which is going to take some time but definitely in the coming year 18 months you'll see a great progress there, so a great discipline. Now in Diversey Care it's about the culture of discipline and that's what we are engaging and.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "When you look at the EBITDA bridge for the quarter or so far in 2014 the increase has been disproportionate on the pricing cost side. At the margin expansion both food and product since it -- seems to be well underway. As we think about it comparable bridge for 2015 how should we think about these various elements of year-over-year basis including foreign exchange and since (indiscernible) on the call may be Ilham more specifically will participate in 2015 on a financial basis. Thanks.", "Carol Lowe", "We're not providing 2015 guidance right now. But what I will say because we know there is concerned around currency and obviously because we have such a large percent -- percentage of our sales better European or based in some countries where there have been devaluation we will share that lets make an assumption that the euro was at a dollar $.25 for 2014. That could potentially have an impact on our 2015 sales top line for a negative currency of $300 million. Now that is not just the euro but looking at across all of their currencies which could potentially have an impact on (indiscernible), as approximately $40 million on a year-over-year basis. So we will share that but again not any additional comments on 2015 guidance.", "Jerome Peribere", "Before I jump on to Diversey Care let me just say this is going to be of course an impact that we are likely to see happen. We haven't seen it in Q3. We will see somewhat sizable amount -- currency impact on (indiscernible) in Q4 it will be it $11 million. And Carol just talked about the $40 million on the EBITDA level adjustment currency at the exchange rate of today and it is not the euro do evaluating it is all the other -- it is the dollar reevaluating against other major currencies etcetera. So as far as we're concerned we already have embarked into a plan intervention on which is going to mitigate this.", "And of course you will hear about our guidance in early February but I want you to know that Ilham said the right word. We're moving towards a culture of discipline. We are ready proactively are taking actions to mitigate that kind of negative impact.", "Ilham Kadri", "So on Diversey Care specifically over the market in Q4 is forecasted to be largely flat as compared to Q3 and we continue our journey towards quality business existing low-margin businesses and replacing those -- will with higher-margin customers as we have done in the UK and other places. We expect Eastern Europe and AMAT Latin America to continue showing good growth. I might as well about the businesses seasonality. Quarter two is our strongest quarter of the year. The difference between quarter three and quarter for is much smaller and depends on distribution channel sales and equipment sales which can travel between one 2 or another. I also remind you that our business and Diversey Care 45% of our business in Diversey Care is in Europe.", "The currency exposure as we will say will impact but -- as we speak we're trying to mitigate the currency impact and despite the challenging environment Diversey Care is holding its own with a handful of customer wins and for saving programs. And also you will CSN quarter for targeting to invest in sales, marketing and R&D which will further allow Diversey Care to differentiate in the marketplace but expect margin growth and margin expansion for the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays.", "Scott Gaffner - Barclays", "Just wanted to dig into food care for a moment, adjusted EBITDA margin year-to-date you have it at 17.4%. I think at the Analyst Day you mentioned 16% to 16.5%. Is there any reason that you can see Jerome why there would be some margin get back and the next couple of years or is there the ability to continue to push hard on price cost even if the -- prices maybe come down next year and in the future. Thanks.", "Jerome Peribere", "So what you just said is that we are ahead of our program. And yes in 2014 execution is doing extremely well. So my answer to you is no, there is no reason that it would be giving back. You have the present prices and they go up or down. The trend is up. And I think nobody should expect that we're going to see price is going down over time. There is a decoupling for many years now between the price of -- in North America and the price of gas and shale gas which is why it produces have had so much margin expansion and this is due to tight capacity utilization which are also affecting Europe.", "We have prepared ourselves for two years now with the disciplined approach to our pricing and this is about passing the cost increases as they occur. Next to that you have innovation and you have all the service and the value that we add to our customers and the value that we add to the customers is huge thanks to our innovation especially and if you had have been at that -- which is food show of the world's which happened last week in Europe you would have seen that our -- was the star product. It was the star attraction.", "And we have had extreme success with that launch just recently . This is going to be followed into the U.S. We also are launching a higher view -- which is called opted in Europe and in Q4 we will be launching on target in North America (indiscernible) Expo in November do in Chicago. We have a lot of momentum with innovation and that is how we express the fact that we're bringing value to our customers. And that is the way we approach the situation.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo.", "Chris Manuel - Wells Fargo", "You talked about potentially or alluded to potentially doing some further restructuring or some other actions in '15. I want to get a sense as to what we some thoughts as to how you are thinking about what that might look like. Is that focused the next wave of restructuring primarily take a more cost at of the business. You\u2019re -- on quite a way that way looking through different businesses. Is a more focused maybe on headcount Warren regions or to improve the work to grow the business faster or how do you think about the next way that you would undertake and what it might touch.", "Jerome Peribere", "So let me introduce the subject and Carol might add some color here. We have a very key metric which is our gross profits ratio. Our work profit ratio is a productivity ratio. We believe that we can improve and should improve this ratio year-over-year in the next several years. So this is not a metric for one to two years. I believe that we can progress on productivity. You have seen -- we all do projections and you've seen that some areas of the world are softer than some others.", "And you see some functions which can continue to improve on the productivity. So that is where we are targeting our program. By definition we do to restructuring for the state of restructuring. You've heard me say several times that we're moving there to become a modern and well-managed company. That is the -- there is still we are to do, we continue in the journey. And we are -- talking about playback time on those restructuring programs to improve our expense profit ratio which is a good way of operating this business. And in some regions we do have a better ratio than some others, those are to be unaffected than some others.", "Carol Lowe", "Chris, just a couple comments to follow one, referencing productivity, metric that we use as part of our annual incentive program. Year-to-date we have had a 240 basis point improvement in that metric so it is a keen focus across the entire company. And as I stated in my prepared comments in a restructuring program that we can -- conduct going forward that we might take to the board we would expect to fully fund with the grace tax refund that we will receive in 2015 and that is made at approximately $200 million from the cash that we would receive back so we would expect to fully funded and I will also remind you that I talked about last quarter the fact that we had an incentive a special incentive program focused on free cash flow generation.", "It's a three-year program that runs through the end of 2016 . The starting point to have any payout under the program we have to receive $1.7 billion and free cash flow generation over the three-year period. And we expect to have that program be a very positive program for a large number of our employees in the company.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.", "Mark Wilde - Bank of Montreal", "I wondered if you take a step back now after 24 months if you have any different views on what the growth rate potential is in these different businesses one with the margin potential of the businesses is. You are still a long way from the kind of margins that the legacy Sealed Air business had back in the late 90s and early 2000s.", "Jerome Peribere", "All right. So it's a good benchmark. It's a good benchmark and you have -- we have laid out the journey. In our invested day September of last year. We're going to have another investor day in June of next year. This one is going to be focused on innovation and change the game. We are ahead of our forecast as you all can see by now . And in my view is that this company is a company which is continuing on its way to transformation. We are very truly reimagining Sealed Air. For those who would think that are margin is plateauing our view is that it is going to continue to improve.", "It's going to continue to improve as a result of our discipline and this is where we would call the quote unquote mathematical aspects of it. And we had very focused and targeted programs on multifunctional and multi-businesses. We also are transforming this company with regards to the value we create to our customers. And we now price according to the value that we create to our customers.", "And therefore my view is that the target -- the numbers you are referring to are the good -- are realistic numbers long-term, what is long-term? Probably more than two years. We are not been a good to 20% EBITDA and 2016 or in 2017. We have laid the road. But you heard me very clearly saying that there are two phases in our transformation. One is called to get that. (Indiscernible), this is the mechanical part of the business. And we are making fabulous progress.", "We are starting in reimagining Sealed Air in the way of transforming this company and change in the game. The move to Charlotte having all the divisions together exchanging ideas and you and setting be outcomes because the commonality of the three divisions is about selling the outcome and not selling staffed. That is going to change this company. I am very optimistic. You laid out the journey and I will follow it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs", "On Diversey Care and as you think about the marketplace and how you stack up relative to your biggest competitor can you just talk about how over the last couple of years you feel like you've improved the diversity business where you can better compete in the market relative to send competitors.", "Jerome Peribere", "Diversey Care rather than on a given competitor. Obviously our focus in such that the company was to lose (indiscernible) better quality businesses and this is the name of the game. And I tell you it has been the biggest mine -- our organization has experience in. For example to give you an example of how we track to win on wins and losses we track all the wins and losses above 500K and this is a low threshold and we did it in -- to allow us building a division culture around quality wins and low-quality business losses. Year-to-date we\u2019re -- we target to win and offset this with a better quality business and this is what we're doing in many places like in the UK as a shared in my prepared remarks that we're doing it in other places as well.", "This is key as we cannot lose business -- fixed cost as we are in the service business. The example of a growing in the U.S. is continued and infrastructure there targeting to expand and hospitality where we are progressing very well and getting more wins in service while our equipment's are being adopted by the U.S. markets in the building service contract and -- education. So all-in-all we are gaining share.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.", "Adam Josephson - KeyBanc", "I tried a bit late so my apologies but mature mind reminding us about the restrictions on your ability to buy back shares in the next two years and what if anything you might to regarding your notes outstanding to deal with that issue.", "Carol Lowe", "Right now what we would have remaining based on since September we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $33 for a total of approximately value of 27 million. That would be best with a capacity of approximately 40,000,000 due to the restricted payment basket. We've been very focused on having the leverage reach between 3 1/2 and four times as we wrapped up Q3 we have now dropped below four times where at approximately 4.8 times leverage so that gives us flexibility to take a look at our debt structure and maybe step up and how we're going to pursue looks ability to return value to shareholders.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners", "Question is on the pricing power. It looks like clearly in the quarter both food care and product care side nice -- at least price mix improvement. I guess the two-part question is how much of it would you say of the roughly 4% improvement was price and how much was mix and as you look ahead to think there still more runway in terms of recapturing some of the value that Sealed Air should of been getting in the past as you talked about its product differentiation. Do you have more room there?", "Jerome Peribere", "First speaking you heard me say in February 2013 that I see this -- the role of a leader leads and that is our responsibility. We have sometimes the market shares and we need to decide what is our approach to the value we create and how we share it. We have clearly determined this. So when you look at the price mix in the third quarter actually what we think is that -- is increasing but the bulk of it is in price. And if you look at those let me give you some flavor. If you look at food care for example we have a price mix in the third quarter of 4% and almost 3 is just price.", "There is a lot in North America just on price and in Latin America you need to remember that we by residents in dollar or in dollar equivalent and as a result we have had a lot of price and out price Latin America and food care up 13% about nine is just right and it is very key because otherwise our margins would go down. In product care it is about the same kind of trend.", "When we talk about price mix the bulk is on price and just to give you an example in North America in product care our price mix was 4.6% in the third quarter and almost four was just price. In Europe you don't have the same kind of environment because you have -- a deflation environment right we're also having margin expansion and we are positive on price alone be on food care be on product care and also in Diversey Care when you look at this. So it is not only about price but it is also about -- but it's not only about price.", "What I'm really attentive to is whether we do have margin expansion for margin compression. And we are having margin expansion and we have room to go.", "Operator", "You next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "George Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right now you are still in the get fit phase. And it's been growing as you said well. Does the imperative to innovate does the imperative to drive mix relative to price increase perhaps even on the exponential rate over the next couple of years given what's already been record progress on margin and pricing for the business so that obviously you don't sell product you\u2019re trying to sell value but to also want to maintain your shares, were there is economic profit over time. So does the imperative to innovate and to raise mix accelerate here in the next couple of years and how do you do that. Thanks and good luck in the quarter.", "Jerome Peribere", "Actually it's a repeat of your second quarter question which was thank you very much for get fit when it's change the game coming, that was your question. And let me confirm the change the game is not going to be coming. It is on route, every single division has a change the game commitment and I know what you guys want -- what you want is show me the money. Show me the innovation. Show me the change the game and give me numbers.", "And this is why we're going to do that in 2015 at our Investor Day focused on change the game where we are going to give you specific examples of how we tackle the market differently. It is important for us to bring innovation and we\u2019re bringing innovation because innovation is the mother of differentiation and therefore of margin expansion through creation of value to our customers.", "I have several examples but I'm going to take -- I already talked about on Food Care, a good trait. A great innovation, (indiscernible) great innovation. We are going to be talking to you pretty soon about the new type of structure in that which is going to be fairly disruptive. On product care our Instapak Simple that we have launched on October 1 is a great innovation and it is a great innovation because the main issue of Instapak is that you need to have a fairly big sizable equipment to serve your customers or in the customer premises. Well this is a smaller equipment which opens a whole lot doors to e-commerce and to smaller type of companies who need strong cushioning. I\u2019ve several examples on Diversey Care and including on some mops [ph] and but you might want to mention one or two Ilham there.", "Ilham Kadri", "As Jerome said in Diversey Care journey, get fit and change the game. One of sequential events. We started both at the same time. And I believe we shall completely differentiated value proposition. I remind you that we\u2019re the only player in the market who has chemicals, machines, tools and equipment and the Intellitrail example I shared in my prepared remarks speaks for itself. We compete by integrating and differentiating the technology and with invoice detergent dollars but we sell productivity and labor productivity program to building service contractors.", "Finally and this is something new and we change the conversation with our customers, we are still there and our business puts together can offer to retail store or a quick service restaurants much more that\u2019s just detergents or soaps. We are leader in food waste and farm to fork chain management and along with Diversey Care food safety program and integrated social we are combining both trends to better service our customers.", "Operator", "We have no more questions.", "Jerome Peribere", "In that case I am going to make a last comment to George's question. We are having a very strong focus on the long-term because we are determined to transform this company into what I called a knowledge based company. That is what we are. This is a long-term goal and we are truly going to become more and more knowledge based company. This is a journey and this is why we have those two programs one is about delivering short term and we're very pleased with where we are now. And the second one is about creating additional value to our customers into the company. Thank you very much for attending. I hope to see you soon and we will continue working.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this call is being recorded for recording purposes. And now I would like to hand the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Lori.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements.

Please note that we will end the call by 9:30 today.", "Now I will turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome Peribere", "Thank you, Lori and good morning everyone. I am very pleased to report that 2014 was a very strong year for Sealed Air. We exceeded our financial objectives in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014 and expanded margins by 90 basis points despite currency headwinds. We had favorable price mix in every region and in every division in the quarter and for the full year. We improved the health of our balance sheet and generated over $600 million in free cash flow. We continued on our innovation path including for example Darfresh entre, Instapak Simple, and a new TASKI XP platform. We also announced the relocation of our headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina and launched a new website. ", "These are just some of the many successes that we had over the last 12 months and while we are pleased with our 2014 financial results, we still believe that there is significant improvement to be had in terms of top line potential growth and further margin expansion as well as maximizing our free cash flow generation. But before we review our fourth quarter and year-end results, I want to share some insights on how we are approaching 2015. ", "Based on foreign exchange rates today, we are assuming unfavorable currency translation of approximately $550 million in sales and $80 million on EBITDA in 2015. And while we anticipate as reported sales in 2015 to be down approximately 5% compared to 2014, we expect to grow approximately 2.5% in constant currency and are confident that we will deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. EBITDA growth and margin expansion will be driven not only by favorable input cost but also our continued focus on value adding selling, operational disciplines, and earnings quality improvement efforts. ", "With that said let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end results and Carol will provide of course more details on our 2015 outlook. Let's start with 2014 full year performance by region on slide 4. Net sales were up slightly on an as reported basis and up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $183 million impact on net sales in 2014. By region, sales in North America increased 3% on a constant currency basis due to 5% growth in Product Care, 2% growth in both Food Care and Diversey Care.", "In Europe sales improved on constant currency basis, each quarter throughout the year resulting in a modest increase in constant currency sales in 2014 as compared to a slight decline in 2013. Latin America and AMAT were our fastest growing regions in constant currency sales growth in the middle high -- in the high single digits. Constant currency sales in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were up 2% in 2014. ", "On slide 5, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales declined 2% on an as reported basis but were up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $105 million impact on net sales in the quarter compared to $183 million for the full year. Sales in North America were up 2% led by 5% growth in Product Care and 4% growth in Diversey Care. Food Care sales were essentially unchanged compared to last year. Sales in Europe were down 6% on a reported basis and up 2% in constant currency. ", "To be more specific on our performance in Europe, let me provide you with country trends on a constant currency basis in the quarter as the UK delivered strong growth of 9% with double-digit growth in Food Care and mid single digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. Spain, Switzerland, and Holland were flat to slightly up while France, Italy, and Germany declined. The seven countries I just referenced accounted for 21% of our fourth quarters consolidated sales and I also would like to highlight that Russia continued to deliver strong growth with net sales in Q4 increasing 5% on an as reported basis which translate to approximately 40% growth in constant currency. ", "Moving on to Latin America and AMAT, both regions delivered constant currency sales growth in the high single digit in the quarter, and in AMAT, China, and India delivered double digit sales growth and in Latin America, Brazil, and Mexico delivered mid single digit growth. On an as reported basis, AMAT was up approximately 3% and Latin America down 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of significant currency devaluations. Constant currency sales in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were up slightly in the quarter, growth in Australia was slightly offset by the decline in New Zealand. ", "On slide 6 we learn our price mix volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slides, we had constant currency sales growth and variable price mix in every division and every region in the fourth quarter and in 2014. Food Care had solid performance despite the challenge in the protein market in North America. Constant currency sales in both Diversey Care and Product Care improved each quarter throughout the year. ", "We also stayed focused on our commitment to shift our business to a more innovative, value added solutions and provide in best in class service to our customers on a global basis. We have made significant progress on this front but there is still plenty of room for improvement as we continue to evolve into a knowledge based company. You will hear more about all of this at our Analyst Day on June 18, in New York City. ", "Turning to our performance by division, I will focus my comments on fourth quarter results on a constant currency basis. On slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% with approximately 3% in Packaging and 2% in Hygiene. Latin America increased sales by 10% and AMAT increased 2%. Europe had a strong performance with a growth of 5% whereas North America was relatively flat. Developing regions which include Latin America, AMAT, and Eastern European Countries delivered double-digit growth led by strong performance in Argentina, Russia, and China. ", "In Europe Packaging sales increased nearly 9% while Hygiene declined 3%. The Protein market was up slightly in the quarter which helped but we also continued to see increased demand for our value added solutions and new platforms. In Hygiene you know that we continued to prune low margin businesses and while this effort impacted top line, it made a significant contribution to our EBITDA margin performance. Food Care adjusted EBITDA in Europe delivered margin expansions of 300 basis points in 2014. This significant improvement was due to a combination of a low margin pruning and operational improvements in our hygiene business as well as the accelerated adoption of our innovative Packaging portfolio. ", "In North America cattle and hog production were down approximately 8% and 4% respectively compared to last year. Despite these unfavorable market trends in North America, our sales were relatively flat compared to last year due to favorable product mix and better pricing. To reiterate what we said in our last earnings call, we believe that this cycle is close to the bottom and we expect that the rate of decline to moderate over the next 12 months. ", "It is worth noting that on a global basis our three largest market segments fresh red meats, smoked and processed, and poultry delivered sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Poultry have also been a key growth driver in North America and in Latin America. The strong performance is a direct result of increased demand for our advanced solutions such as Case Ready, Darfresh, Fluids, Grip & Tear, Quick. We introduced Darfresh entre during the fourth quarter and we have already experienced significant traction in both Europe and North America. Darfresh entre is a system solution that reduces food waste into total distribution system while also utilizing less material. ", "I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the fourth quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $172 million or 17.5% of net sales increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of pricing discipline, improved mix, and cost synergies. And for the full year, Food Care's net sales of $3.8 billion increased 4% in constant currency, and was essentially unchanged on an as reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2014 of 17.5% increased 140 basis points over 2013 which is an outstanding performance. And going forward in 2015 we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost, and our continued focus on innovation and operational discipline are expected to more than offset the forecast of currency headwinds. ", "Slide 8 highlights the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on constant currency basis were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Volume and price mix were up approximately 2% each. Developing regions increased 11% led by 16% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in AMAT. Our fastest growing countries were China, India, and Brazil and North America increased sales 4% which is our strongest performance in North America over the last 24 months. ", "In Europe sales were essentially unchanged, positive trends in the UK and Switzerland offset by declines in France and Germany. Holland, Italy, and Spain were relatively flat and from an end market perspective on a global basis, our strongest sectors in the quarter were building service contractors and hospitality. We have had a number of solid customer wins that are beginning to ramp up and contribute to our top line results. And during the quarter we introduced amongst others the TASKI XP platform, a standalone -- a stand on, sorry, Floor Care machine that delivers 30% more productivity than the conventional work behind Floor Care machines. ", "As you can see, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $58 million or 10.9% of net sales in the quarter. We are beginning to reap the benefits of our targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing but unfavorable currency translation and certain supply chain cost had a negative impact on margins during that fourth quarter. Diversey Care generates nearly 45% of its sales from Europe and its performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was negatively impacted by currency declines. ", "For the full year Diversey Care's net sales of $2.2 billion increased 3% in constant currency and were essentially unchanged on an as reported basis. But adjusted EBITDA in 2014 of $245 million increased 3% compared to last year. To be noted is that excluding unfavorable currency translation in the fourth quarter and in 2014, Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA was up 5% and 8% respectively. In 2015 we expect Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA growth to be moderated due to its high exposure to the euro. ", "Turning to slide 9, Product Care delivered 5% constant currency sales in the fourth quarter, sales growth in the fourth quarter which is at highest growth rate all year. This growth was attributable to favorable price mix of 4% and as we have continued to shift our business towards high performance solutions, including cushioning and packaging systems and continued to focus on improving the quality of our general use business. As we have discussed, growth in e-commerce and third party logistics is increasing demand for our cushioning and packaging systems and we expect these trends to continue going forward. ", "If you recall last quarter, I highlighted the Instapak Simple as one of our key innovations that brings the benefit of cost effective, high performance damage reduction to emerging regions and the e-commerce market. This product was successfully launched from October of last year. ", "North America which accounts for about 60% of our Product Care business increased sales 5%. Europe represents just over 20% of Product Care sales and had its strongest performance of the year with over 3% growth. AMAT also had its strongest performance of the year with 11% sales growth and AMAT and Japan, Australia, and New Zealand combined account for just under 20% of Product Care sales but it is worth highlighting that both China and Japan had double digit growth in the quarter. Latin America accounts for only 4% of Product Care sales and declined 2% due to the rationalization efforts that were completed during the quarter. ", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $77 million or 79% of net sales. Growth in cushioning and packaging systems along with product and customer rationalization actions in general use had a significant impact on our adjusted EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Every quarter in 2014 we delivered both top line and adjusted EBITDA growth. ", "For the full year Product Care\u2019s net sales of $1.7 billion increased 4% in constant currency and 3% on and an as reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10% compared to last year and margins improved 120 basis points to 17.7%. The rates of adjusted EBITDA growth surpassed sales growth throughout the year, underscoring our commitment to securing the appropriate value for our solutions. Going forward in 2015 we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost, and our continuous focus on innovation and operational discipline in general use are expected to more than offset currency headwinds. ", "And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow, and outlook for 2015. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 10 and slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on slide 10, we delivered 2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and 7.8 billion for the year. On a constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 3% for both periods. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix which was 3% or 61 million in the quarter and 3.2% or 249 million for the full year. ", "Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods, unfavorable currency translation with 105 million in the quarter and 183 million for the full year. Approximately 20% of our total sales are exposed to the euro, approximately 4% to the Brazilian real, and then we have approximately 2% exposure to both the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.", "Turning to slide 11, for the quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $282 million or 14.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $48 million. Cost synergies were $22 million in the quarter. Selling, general, and administrative and other expenses increased by $40 million of which $17 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance based compensation and $14 million was related to salary inflation. Currency translation had a negative $17 million impact on EBITDA in the quarter. Despite currency headwinds we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the fourth quarter last year. ", "For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year to $1.12 or to $1.12 billion or 14.4% of net sales. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price cost spread of 3.2% or $150 million on essentially flat volume. Cost synergies of $97 million were more than offset by an increase in SG&A and other expenses of $127 million of which $46 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance based compensation and $54 million was related to salary inflation. ", "For the full year, currency had a negative impact of $30 million on adjusted EBITDA. Yet we delivered 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2013. ", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.59 as compared to $0.39 in the fourth quarter last year. 2014 EPS was $1.86 as compared to $1.39 in 2013, an increase of over 30%. The 2014 tax rate of 22% was lower than our previously provided guidance of 27% largely due to the December enactment of credit extenders as well as favorable earnings mix. In 2013 our tax rate was 21%. ", "During the fourth quarter 2014 we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $50 million at an average price of $36 per share. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $184 million at an average price of $34 per share. This includes approximately 3.9 million shares purchased from the WRG Asbestos Personal Injury Trust in the second quarter of 2014.", "Since the beginning of this year 2015, we have repurchased approximately 498,000 shares for $21 million at an average price of $41 per share. We will continue to be active in the market and have the capacity to buy an additional $69 million in shares through the end of 2015. We continue to evaluate alternatives that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders and maintain our target leverage of 3.5 to 4 times. ", "Now turning to slide 12, free cash flow was a force of $612 million in 2014 excluding the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of 509 million in 2013 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales improved from 17% at the end of 2013 compared to 14% at the end of 2014. The company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13 month average target. For the 13 month period ending December 31, 2014, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 17%. This represents 200 basis point improvement compared to 2013. ", "CAPEX was $154 million and cash restructuring cost were $108 million in 2014. Cash payments related to SARs were $21 million as compared with 46 million in the prior year. Cash interest payments in 2014 excluding the settlement were $293 million compared to $290 million in 2013. ", "Turning to slide 13, in December 2014 we issued $425 million for 4 and 78 senior notes due 2022 and $425 million, 5 and 8 senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds from the offerings were used to repurchase the 750 million 8 and 8 senior notes. In July, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities. Altogether, these transactions reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately 30 million, provide extended maturities, and increased covenant flexibility. ", "Turning to slide 14, our outlook for 2015 is presented. We expect net sales to be approximately 7.4 billion, a decline of approximately 5% on a reported basis but an increase of approximately 2.5% in constant currency. As Jerome mentioned earlier, we estimate an unfavorable impact of approximately 515 million on sales from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 as compared to 2014 adjusted EPS of $1.86. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015. ", "Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of 1.15 billion to 1.18 billion or approximately 3% to 5.5% growth rate on a reported basis. Currency is estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately 80 million. We are confident that we can achieve the level of EBITDA presented as we continue to focus on our disciplines to improve the quality of earnings and benefit from favorable input cost. Additionally, we expect approximately 50 million in cost synergies most of which will come from the earnings quality and improvement restructuring program. ", "In late December our Board approved a new restructuring program, the Fusion Program which will consist of projects across our three divisions as well as functional support. This program is expected to generate savings of approximately 80 million to 85 million by the end of 2018. We do not expect to realize any savings from this program until early 2016. ", "The cost of the Fusion Program is expected to be approximately $275 million to $285 million of which the net cash outflow is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. We anticipate the proceeds from asset sales and state incentives to be approximately $65 million. Our guidance for free cash flow is approximately $600 million for 2015 which excludes the tax refund related to the Grace settlement of approximately $245 million. ", "Our outlook for free cash flow is derived from higher earnings, improvements in working capital and lower cash interest payments offset by higher restructuring cash cost and capital expenditures as compared to 2014. Cash restructuring cost excluding restructuring CAPEX are expected to be $120 million. This $120 million consists of approximately $50 million from previously announced restructuring programs and approximately $70 million from the new Fusion Program. ", "Capital expenditures are expected to be $180 million which includes approximately $45 million of CAPEX related to restructuring activities. In 2014 CAPEX was a $154 million of which approximately $25 million was related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in CAPEX for 2015 as compared to 2014 excluding the restructuring activities I just mentioned is associated with target growth projects for Food Care, Product Care, and Diversey Care and R&D pilot plant and the second phase of our ERP implementation. Cash interest payments are expected to be $255 million and cash taxes are expected to be $110 million. ", "Before I open the call to questions I would to like to remind you that our first quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April the 28th at 8:30 AM and Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care Division will be joining us for that discussion. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June the 18th in New York City as previously mentioned. I look forward to speaking with you again in the near future. With that operator can you please open the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. ", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Hey, guys good morning. ", "Jerome Peribere", "Good morning Ghansham.", "Carol Lowe", "Good morning. ", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Good morning sir, just first off could you just give us a sense as to what the volume outlook by an operating segment is for 2015 as it relates to your guidance and I guess that\u2019s related, your guidance is for 2.5% constant currency growth given where resin and kind of what it\u2019s doing right now and some of your pass through in your contracts, is it fair to expect a negative price mix bios partially portfolio for the year? Thanks. ", "Jerome Peribere", "Good question Ghansham. So our volume for 2015 is going to be at about 1.5% or so. And this compares with zero volume growth that we had in 2014 and about slightly higher than 1% in 2013. We are going to see volume growth in the three divisions, led by Diversey Care and Product Care and also some in Food Care. So, the story of price mix is going to be somewhat different than the one of 2014 because obviously the resin prices have been and are coming down and as a result of that it is not so much price which is going to be important into 2015 but just margin and margin expansion. And we do believe that we are going to be having margin expansion from all kind of things. ", "Number one, we need to remember that we are in a recovery mode. We have lost a lot of pricing over the past few years and we need to rehabilitate pricing. This is true for what I would call the commodity parts of our portfolio specifically in Product Care and in Food Care. ", "In Product Care we still have a whole segment which is we call the general use which I would tend to call the more commoditized type of product lines and those were as they have been doing better in 2014, they are far from being at an acceptable level. So, we are going to be holding very firm and we are holding very firm on our pricing. We will only respond to competitive aggression and that's all we are going to do. ", "On Food Care, we do have some regional weaknesses in some product lines and that is what we are going to be addressing on pricing. Obviously currency translation is hurting and as they all continue to go down because the dollar is revaluating regularly amongst almost all currencies. We are in need to adjust our pricing. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. ", "John McNulty", "Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. With regard to resin prices having come off, have you started to see any of your customers potentially upgrade their products at this point. I know there was a lot of kind of down shifting of products that they were looking at when oil prices and resin ran up. So have you seen the reverse of that yet, and is it something you are expecting as you look into 2015?", "Jerome Peribere", "Good morning John, I can't precisely answer your question other than make the following comments. We are working very hard at addressing the customer needs depending on the segment they want to touch. So, some -- you take Food Care as an example, some customers want more shelf life and as they want more shelf life, they need to work great in the quality of the products. ", "Some others want portion size with potentially less shelf life but improving compared to what is on the shelf today. This is a real strong trend right now and so on. So, what we have in Sealed Air now is a whole commercial organization absolutely obsessed with understanding and satisfying customer needs. So it is going to really be on a case by case basis and more than a general approach which by the way I haven\u2019t been told that this is the case, in terms of grading generally speaking the packaging. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America. Go ahead please. ", "George Staphos", "Thanks everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details and taking my question. Congratulations on the year. I guess maybe related to what Ghansham was getting at, if I take the midpoint of your range for 2015 from a margin standpoint, it is up roughly about 130 basis points if I did my math correctly versus 2014 despite the foreign exchange headwinds. So Jerome and Carol, as we think about how you have confidence in that goal which you said you did is most of the progress towards that going to come from mix and further value selling or will more of it come from productivity or other buckets and within that how would we think about the mixture across the three segments? And the last thing is, sounds like Diversey will have a tough time growing this year because of FX, would you confirm that or add color, thank you and good luck in the quarter?", "Jerome Peribere", "Thanks George, good to talk to you. What the big hitter, the big hitter in 2015 is obviously that we\u2019re going to have more than half a billion dollars of currency translation. Just imagine, just go back one second to the fourth quarter and imagine us publishing a constant currency EBITDA number of about $300 million in the fourth quarter which is what you would get if you add the $280 million and the $17 million of EBITDA currency translation loss. So we would have all celebrated an extraordinary quarter. ", "I can assure you that we would have just blown away our numbers on a constant currency basis for 2015. But life is what it is and we have felt what\u2019s coming actually very early in September actually and we have started very early to take measures hence our Fusion project. To come to the point, $550 million and more possibly of foreign currency translation equally balanced by volume about $100 million and price mix. So that\u2019s the way we are seeing it. We are going to stay very firm in prices first of all because resin is not the only component of our cost. It is only a part of it. We have -- we are a highly serviced company. As a result of that we have a lot of manpower, we have 25,000 employees or 24,000 employees in this company, and therefore you remember my comment of two years ago about the salary match increase year-on-year. So this is a big part of the cost. And we have conversion cost, etc. ", "Coming on to Diversey Care well by definition with 45% of our sales in Europe we are exposed to currency and the translation that I just talked about. And therefore we are anticipating a slight improvement in our profitability in dollar basis. Having said that let me remind you that we are very clearly on the right track as proven in 2013. EBITDA improvement and as proven in our 2014 EBITDA growth as we have in constant currency, we have grown about 8%. So we are making wins in the field, it happens in the field but we are very focused on margin improvement in that business which is the thing which is going to last overtime no matter what currency is doing. ", "Carol Lowe", "And George I\u2019ll just add just to remind everyone we highlighted the 80 million EBITDA foreign exchange expected negative hit year-over-year in our 2015 guidance. In addition for a couple of years now we have talked very publicly that we have approximately around 60 million in annual inflationary cost related to wages benefits. So if take those two as cost increases to go from the 1.18 billion to the guidance we\u2019ve provided for EBITDA for 2015, that tells you and then you take the 50 million positive for cost synergies, you can do the math and see what\u2019s remaining and that it\u2019s all coming. A lot of good benefit from mix and price cost spread as well as the volume growth that Jerome highlighted for both benefitting the company and again staying firm on our good practices and policies and the cultural changes that we\u2019re making. Also I\u2019ll just mention real quickly back to John\u2019s question, because of the great advances of technology I got an update from our President of our Product Care Division to answer about the quality of the products and he -- if not meaningfully up but we are starting to see a shift towards some of our core view products for e-commerce which is a much higher quality product as well as our inflatable bubble which is also higher quality than some of our general use products. So we are starting to see a little bit of that trend but it is still very minor at this point. ", "George Staphos", "Thank you, Carol. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please proceed. ", "Scott Gaffner", "Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to look backwards and look forwards around your pricing initiatives. I mean if I look back to 2014 maybe even over the last 18 months a lot of your pricing initiatives look like they came on the back of higher resin, maybe that made it a little bit easier for you, maybe it made it made it more difficult, but can you talk about what the decline in resin means as far as pricing initiatives going forward and can you also talk about what sort of benefits if you were to maintain pricing you would get from lower resin, thanks?", "Jerome Peribere", "So, I am not Scott going to go too much in details there for obvious competitive reasons. But what we have embarked into is a whole program of margin restoration. I said some time ago that we were not having reinvestment economics and we did need -- we do need to have that. This is the very basis of proper business management. So we have gotten pricing as a result of resins and we have gotten other type of pricings at the very same time. ", "In the future, we have in Europe for example last year, sorry before coming to the future, we had last year pricing power also in Europe despite a very poor environment. So, this company is in transformation and it is on the way of doing two things in a very disciplined way. The first one is good business management. You saw it in terms of margin expansion, we need margin expansion because we have -- because they have dramatically deteriorated in the past. And we are going to continue to be doing this. We are going to have mixed improvement because by definition we are not putting the resources on our lower margin products, we are shifting them towards higher margin products. And we are doing working capital management. ", "You have seen what we have done in just one year, we moved 300 basis points from 14% of operating working capital -- from 17% operating working capital to 14%. And this is -- and we are continuing to do this kind of things. And at the very same time we have started to reinvent this company and this company is not going to be just about more plastic. It is going to be about the cutting edge of the technologies which will enable our customers to win. That is what we are going towards. That should give them higher margins and give us higher margins. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Good morning, this is actually Gayle Barn [ph] for Chris. Congratulations on the year. Just had a question about the state of economy across the world with the U.S. kind of emerging as being holding more strong and some of the developing regions being a little bit fragile and how you expect to sort of -- what regions and/or product lines you expect to get the 1.5% volume growth that you talked about?", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay, well Chris good question and good morning. Well the buzz word which is not mine which is everybody's is volatility. I got it all wrong in fourth quarter when in October I said that we were anticipating, we were already into the fourth quarter and we were anticipating $10 million negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation. We got $17 million, almost double. During the fourth quarter our average exchange rate for the euro was 126 and the real at 247, the ruble at 43. Guess what, the ruble is at 66 today, the euro is at 113, the Brazilian real is at 281. So more volatile than that, I don\u2019t know. So which is why I am stopping making projections on resin prices for example, on currencies, etc and our exchange rates for 2015 are at around those levels that we have today although possibly just a little bit more conservative. ", "So where is it going to grow, we have \u2013- we are expecting innovation to pull us and actually in Food Care the innovation has already pulled us. Pull our results and our product mix which is going really well. We are going to see a deceleration of the beef cycle, negative beef cycle so things should be improving a little bit in volume in North America. And we should see the hogs business have a little bit of growth in North America which would be all good. Real at 280 is good for meat exports and for local profitability. So we should benefit a little bit about this. ", "In Diversey Care we are continuing to eliminate low margin businesses and at the same time we have had a few solid customer wins and in hospitality we\u2019re going to have even more on healthcare, in the kitchen and on TASKI. So I am positive there, we should have some volume growth there. We continue to grow volume and nicely in emerging countries. In Latin America, in TASKI we have been hurt by very fast devaluations but we\u2019re up in reported dollars in AMAT and we are growing very, very nicely in quite a few countries down there. ", "And in Product Care we have -- Carol talked about our core view line. We have some specialty packaging there which are doing very well and our systems which are doing extremely well also. And that\u2019s where we are planning to shift. You have seen that we had growth in Product Care in Europe which didn\u2019t have for a while. We think we have a lot of momentum in North America and intend to do that. And by the way also in Asia on our Product Care division we are extremely optimistic that we\u2019re going to be succeeding there. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Please proceed.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes, good morning and congratulations on another great year. When you look at the working capital squeeze, Carol you mentioned you got it down to 17% of sales. Could you give us and about 90 million or so I guess last year what should we look for in 2015 and 2016 and then just quickly if you could give us a breakdown of the 97 million in cost saves last year, how that was split between the EQIP Program and the one from back in 2011 I guess it was called the IOP Program?", "Carol Lowe", "Alright, so good morning Chip. As we think about the working capital, it contributed approximately $168 million for 2014 for our free cash flow and for 2013, it was about $145 million. And as we look towards 2015, if you go kind of looking at the $600 million that we guided we would anticipate if you do the math taking into account I gave you CAPEX and restructuring, payments, interest payments you\u2019re going to come right somewhere around 110 million expected benefit from working capital management. We still are slightly over a 100 million and pass due receivables. So we expect some of that benefit to come from continuing to decrease our past dues. If you recall we finished 2012 at over 200 million so we\u2019ve made great progress but there is still some additional progress that we can make. ", "Also our management of inventory, we feel like there are continuing opportunities as we make our processes more robust around our sales and operations planning as well as SKU optimization. We also had some investments in inventory as we started to implement some of our new distribution programs that our supply chain team is working on. So, as we make those transitions, at times we carry slightly higher levels of inventory and then we right size those. So, we did have that right at year end. So, we do have opportunities in both. Our payables, we have made great progress in increasing our days table outstanding and we will continue to focus on that as well where it makes sense and where we have large dollar spend and large volume. ", "In terms of the $97 million in savings that we provided for the improvement from 2013 to 2014 for cost synergies most of that, a large portion of that came from our EQIP Program. We still had a little bit trailing from our integration and optimization program, but the larger portion was from the EQIP Program. And as we looked to 2015, as we noted almost all of that 50 million in cost synergies will come from the EQIP Program as well with the new Fusion Program starting to give us the positive return at the beginning as we move into 2016. ", "The new program has an internal rate of return in excess of 40% so we are really excited about what that's going to bring to our cost structure as well.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Philip NG of Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Alex Hutter", "Good morning, this is Alex Hutter on for Phil, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. One of your public competitors in Food appears to be taking a more proactive stance on price, which was encouraging but can you provide some color on competitive activity in Food Care and Product Care and based on those dynamics do you expect to or have you seen any players ceding price to gain share with resin prices falling?", "Jerome Peribere", "There are some skirmishes in the field here and there by definition and -- but I would say nothing notable. Every company pursues its own strategy. We are not going to lose business that we don\u2019t want to lose. But we are the leader therefore we have to be conservative on price reduction. And as I said before, our strategy is to recoup the margins that we have lost in the past and that's what we really want to do?", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli Company. Please proceed. ", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. ", "Carol Lowe", "Good morning Rosemarie. ", "Jerome Peribere", "Thank you. ", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "I was wondering Jerome you said something to the effect that rebuilds were above your expectations for both the quarter and the year. And I was wondering if you could give us a little more details on the areas where you were surprised on the positive side and whether there were some negative surprise which were more than offset by the positive ones?", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay, Rosemarie good question again. The -- what surprised is not so much the results but -- because the result -- because the financials are the consequence of what we are doing. What surprises me is the speed at which from Q3 to Q4 of 2013 this organization has shifted its mind. And this organization is now a courageous organization. We have our people who believe, our people who see how we are winning and how we can continue to win. Have taken the responsibility of the price leadership and of the product mix leadership and of the need for innovation and therefore things are moving at a pace which is very different than from the past. And I could see that. As I said, sometimes late Q3, early Q4 of last year and therefore you now are seeing the results that we had. ", "We started in the first quarter but in fact it amplified throughout the year. You should, as we have said during the prepared remarks, our Product Care and Diversey Care business had constant currency sales improving every single quarter. In Q1 our Diversey Care business improved in constant currency by 1.2% in Q1 of 2014. It went up and up and up and in the fourth quarter of 2014 it went up by 4%. And this is obviously something extremely important. And the same with our Product Care which started the year at 2.6% and finished the year at 4.6%. And this is extremely important because there is a change in pace, there is more courage in the organization, etc. Doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s going to continue to go crescendo like this because we have as I said before a very volatile environment and so on. ", "So we are not going to take currency as an excuse, we have to do what we have to do. We are going to continue doing and forging ahead through a disciplined approach to our business to improve operationally and to start building and we have started that to start building the future. So as to what didn\u2019t go that well, I would say I am not going to contradict myself with what I said before because I have been really positively surprised as to how we are gaining -- how we are making this cultural change and stuff. ", "So the negative are uncontrollable factors and I don\u2019t control currency and I don\u2019t control the overall economy. Having said that we were not expecting the economy to improve much better, so this is going to be considered as a plus if it does come. It has been here since the last two to three years and we believe that in 2015 it is going to continue to be here. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator?", "Operator", "Hello. Can I just confirm it Anthony Pettinari or you want me to? I am assuming they don\u2019t wish to take the call, shall I forward the next call through to you. ", "Lori Chaitman", "Yes, let\u2019s take the last question please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The last question comes from Al Kabili of Macquarie. Please proceed. ", "Al Kabili", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess Jerome you mentioned that this year is much more about margin than it is about price given the situation with the resin outlook, that said in your outlook how do you think of 2015 as far as, are we getting an outsized resin benefit this year that then makes it more difficult to expand dollar margins next year or do you very much see 2015 as very much part of the normal progression in the EBITDA margin expansion and so you would still look to continue to grow margins in 2016 as well? Thanks. ", "Jerome Peribere", "So, we are ahead of our schedule. You remember that when we had our Investor Day in September of 2013, we have given guidance with regards to our EBITDA margins. We are going to be there and more in 2015. So we are ahead of our schedule. The way it\u2019s going to happen is going to slightly different temporarily but we are continuing to have the same kind of approach to what we wanted to have. But that\u2019s important to understand. I am going to stop making predictions on the resins because in Q4 I was wrong and it is soft in Q1. There are wide discrepancies depending on the parts of the world which will have to be corrected. And next to that you have -- it can turn upside down very quickly depending on the demand in Asia, depending on a few factors here and there you could see resin prices move backup and therefore we have to be very careful with any price concession because as we all know it is much easier to go down then to go up. And these things can turnaround very, very quickly.", "We are resolutely on our way to 20% EBITDA in the mid to long-term. I really believe that with our Get Fit initiatives and with our Change the Game initiatives which are going to start to bear fruit in a meaningful way in 2016, 2017 and from there, we are going to have a portfolio which is going to be fairly different with new and differentiated technologies which should give our customers a differential advantage and improved profitability for ourselves too.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would like to turn the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future, are forward-looking statements.

You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 9:30 today.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. At this point, I'm sure that you had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the first quarter. I have to say that I'm very pleased with our results, and we had a great start off to the year.", "We stayed disciplined throughout the quarter and delivered on our objectives despite heavy currency headwinds. Net sales of $1.7 billion are down 4.4% as reported, but in constant dollars, net sales were up 3.5% compared to last year's first quarter.", "Each division and all regions delivered constant-dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix. The combination of favorable price/mix and lower input costs resulted in a gross margin improvement of over 200 basis points, with strong performance in both Food Care and Product Care.", "For adjusted EBITDA, we delivered $284 million or 16.3% of net sales despite $22 million of unfavorable currency translation. This represents a 260-basis-point margin improvement and, in constant dollars, an increase of 22% compared to last year's performance.", "Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of 21.7%, and Product Care adjusted EBITDA was 20%. Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency but still delivered 6% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant-dollar basis. I will leave the details on the financials and business trends to Carol and our guest executive speaker, Ken Chrisman, who is the President of our Product Care division.", "Before I pass the call to Carol and Ken, I want to highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management, with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. In alignment with this strategy, in March, we acquired the assets of Intellibot Robotics, a startup U.S.-based private company that pioneered the development of robotic commercial floor cleaning machines. Intellibot is really the only currently selling advanced robotics floor care machine outside of the consumer market. These intelligent machines are empowered with sensors used for navigation and are also connected to the cloud for data monitoring, optimization, troubleshooting, servicing and upgrading software. The robotic technology is agnostic to different types of sensors, which will enable new features to be seamlessly incorporated into the platform as they come to market.", "The combination of Intellibot Robotics' expertise and Diversey Care's TASKI mechanical cleaning leadership will accelerate the growth of robotics and what is known as the Internet of Things in the floor cleaning market. We are still at early stages of robotics and automation in the cleaning and hygiene industry, and we are excited to bring the first team of artificial intelligence specialists from Intellibot to Sealed Air Diversey Care.", "In early April, we completed the sale of our North American trays and pads business, a noncore asset within our Food Care division. While we had become the global leader in the food grade absorbent pads, this business was becoming quickly commoditized and faced significant competitive pricing pressures. The business was heading below 10% profit margin, and the North American trays and pads business generated about $200 million of sales -- in sales in 2014 and approximately $50 million in the first quarter.", "I also wanted to share 2 important organizational decisions. First, we have decided to build and own the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina to -- we have decided to build and own the campus in Charlotte, North Carolina for financial reasons. After conducting extensive financial analysis, owning the campus versus signing a long-term lease made the most economical sense. This new state-of-the-art global headquarters will be the home of not just our 3 divisional headquarters, but also the home of our largest R&D center.", "The proceeds from the sales of our trays and pads business and the sale of our building in Racine will fund approximately 2/3 of this capital investment. As a result of this decision, we increased our CapEx budget from $180 million to $210 million in 2015. And second, we made a decision effective in April that we will realign the countries within Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, which we had referred to as our AMAT region. We are also realigning the Japan, Australia and New Zealand region, and going forward, we will report network sales of Europe, Mid-East, Africa and Turkey as the EMEA region. The remaining region will include Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Japan and will be reported as Asia-Pacific. We believe that this realignment will increase local focus and place more accountability in the hands of regional and divisional leaders to create greater cross-selling opportunities across divisions and, especially, a faster decision-making process.", "For today's discussion, Q1 results are presented under the historic regions as these changes are just now taking place. We will provide you with sales trends by new regional alignment at our Analyst Day on June 18 and on our July 30 Second Quarter Earnings Call.", "With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the first quarter. I will highlight sales trends on a constant-dollar basis as compared to last year, unless otherwise noted.", "In the first quarter, Latin America and the region comprised of Japan and Australia and New Zealand were our fastest-growing regions, with constant-dollar growth of 7% and 5%, respectively.", "On a reported basis, both regions were down mid-single digits. Constant-dollar growth in Latin America and Japan/ANZ were driven by strength in our Food Care business with increased demand in Argentina, Mexico and Australia. The AMAT region was up 3% in the quarter, with positive trends in India and Africa for both Food Care and Diversey Care.", "North America sales were up 3% compared to last year, with 3% growth in each of our divisions. Europe was also up 3% in the quarter in constant dollars but down 13% as reported. We delivered 7% constant-dollar sales growth in the U.K. and 1% growth in Spain. France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland were flat to down 1%, and Holland was down in the mid-single digits. The 7 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 20% of first quarter consolidated sales.", "Russia and Poland had solid performance, with Russia delivering nearly 50% constant-dollar sales growth and Poland delivering 7% growth.", "Turning to Slide 5. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales, an increase of 3.5% in constant dollars, unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $146 million or 8%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and the Russian ruble. Net sales on an as-reported basis were down 4.4%. Favorable price/mix was 3.2% or $58 million, and volume was up slightly.", "Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% on a year-over-year basis to $284 million or 16.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $56 million. Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $17 million in the quarter. SG&A and other expenses increased by $18 million, with wage inflation being our largest driver. As a reminder, our annual compensation increases occur April 1 each year.", "Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. We delivered a 210-basis-point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 260-basis-point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. On a constant-currency basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 22% as compared to last year's results.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.54 as compared to $0.33 in the first quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.05. The tax rate for Q1 2015 was 25% as compared with 21% for Q1 2014.", "In the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for a total value of approximately $64 million. As communicated on our last earnings call, our EBITDA leverage ratio target is 3.5x to 4x. We believe this is an optimal leverage ratio for our company. We are currently evaluating options that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders while maintaining our target leverage.", "On Slide 6, we outlined our price/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant-dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see, we had constant-dollar sales growth and favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. And this is our fourth consecutive quarter where we delivered at least 3% constant-dollar sales growth despite our global rationalization efforts.", "I will now turn the call over to Ken, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Product Care as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Food Care. Ken?", "Kenneth P. Chrisman", "Thank you, Carol. Slide 7 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Before we get into the quarter, I want to briefly discuss the organizational changes we made in Product Care that we believe will accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Effective January 1, we realigned Product Care into Global Performance Packaging, which is approximately 40% of Product Care sales, and Global General Packaging, representing approximately 60% of Product Care sales.", "Global Performance Packaging includes our differentiated proprietary platforms that focus primarily on cushioning and damage reduction, such as Instapak, automated systems, core view and specialty foams. Global General Packaging is derived of our more highly distributed solutions, such as our utility offerings, including bubble wrap and Cell-Aire foam, and our higher-growth offerings, including mailers, inflatable bubble and paper systems.", "We also formed a dedicated global sales team to focus on the rapidly expanding e-commerce marketplace and our automated systems. Our end-to-end innovative product offering, combined with our packaging design expertise and global reach, provides us with a significant competitive advantage across multiple industries, including e-commerce. And with this realignment, we are confident we are well positioned to take full advantage of future growth opportunities.", "One thing to keep in mind is that while we are focusing on growth opportunities, we remain committed to delivering earnings quality, and our customer and product rationalization efforts are ongoing.", "Let's take a look at our first quarter performance. Net sales were up slightly in constant dollars. You can see that we had a favorable price/mix of 3.4% on volumes that declined 2.3%. Favorable price/mix is a direct result of the success we have had in shifting our business to higher-performance packaging and our ability to maintain our pricing discipline. First quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in general packaging in all regions.", "Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care achieved adjusted EBITDA margins of 20% or $76 million in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix, lower input costs and cost synergies more than offset FX headwinds, resulting in an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 9% as compared to first quarter 2014. In constant dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 16%. In Product Care, we remain on track to deliver EBITDA growth and margin expansion in 2015.", "Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales, on a constant-currency basis, were up 1.5% in the first quarter. Favorable price/mix was up nearly 2% with positive trends across all regions. Volume was relatively flat. In constant dollars, AMAT sales increased 4% led by mid-single-digit growth in China and double-digit growth in India. North America sales increased 3% on volumes that were up just over 2%, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of sales growth in North America.", "Sales in Latin America and Australia/New Zealand were up slightly, while Europe was essentially unchanged. In Europe, sales were up in the U.K., France and Italy. From a global end market perspective, our strongest sectors in the quarter were building service contractors, hospitality and health care.", "In February, we announced that we signed a 5-year global contract with Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, which represents a significant expansion from our previous 4-year EMEA contract. For those of you who didn't see this press release, our contract with Carlson includes more than 1,300 hotels spanning 105 countries and territories. In addition to the Intellibot Robotics acquisition that Jerome highlighted, Diversey Care introduced a revolutionary small-sized scrubber, the TASKI 2100 Micro, equipped with IntelliTrail, a GPS-enabled remote monitoring device for TASKI machines.", "Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $41 million or 8.8% of net sales in the quarter. As we anticipated, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter. Excluding FX, adjusted EBITDA was up 6% compared to last year. Also, it is important to note that while top line was relatively flat in Europe, we had record level EBITDA margins in this region.", "Aside from FX, we also continued to invest in R&D and sales and marketing to drive future growth, which offset the margin improvements we delivered in Europe. With that said, we continue to estimate constant-dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.", "On Slide 9, we highlight results for our Food Care division, which had an outstanding quarter. In the first quarter, Food Care sales increased 5.8% in constant dollars with favorable price/mix of 3.8% and volume growth of 2%. Our fastest-growing countries in constant dollars were Australia, the U.K., Russia, Mexico and Argentina, which all delivered double-digit growth.", "Developing regions, which include Latin America, AMAT and Eastern European countries, were up 15%, with Latin America up 12% and AMAT up 5%. Europe and JANZ were both up 7%, and North America was up 3%. Price/mix was favorable in every region except for AMAT, which declined slightly due to unfavorable mix. For volume, we had positive trends in every region, except for Latin America due to pricing adjustments in response to currency devaluations.", "In Europe, we outperformed the protein market, which was up in the low single digits due to a more favorable mix driven by demand for our new products and continued pricing discipline. We also had double-digit growth in equipment solution sales in the quarter.", "In North America, our sales were up in the single digits despite cattle production being down nearly 6%. Despite unfavorable market trends in cattle, we still experienced increased demand in fresh red meat due to the adoption of new products and our continued focus on value selling. For the remainder of the year, we expect that these markets -- to continue to decline but at a decelerating rate than what we've been experiencing over the last 6 to 9 months. We also experienced strong sales in smoked and processed meats and poultry. Both markets were up approximately 4% to 5% in the quarter. While we expect these trends to continue in pork, we are closely monitoring the poultry market due to the recent outbreak of avian influenza.", "From a product perspective, I want to highlight that during the first quarter, our Darfresh On Tray package received the Highest Achievement Award from the Flexible Packaging Association's 59th annual Awards and Innovation Showcase. Darfresh On Tray improves product visibility and extend shelf life for the consumers and retailers, while processors benefit from sustainable operational efficiency improvements in throughput and up to 40% reduction in top film with no material scrap", "Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance. Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $191 million or 21.7% of net sales, an increase of 20% as compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, pricing initiatives and cost synergies. Going forward, in 2015, we expect to continue to benefit from further adoption of our new products and continued focus on value selling, which will be offset partially by currency headwinds and formula pricing. I will note, however, that we are well on track to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion.", "Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and outlook. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow was the source of $63 million for the first 3 months of the year. Excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement, this compares favorably to a use of $31 million in the 3 months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management.", "As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending March 31, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 230-basis-point improvement compared to March 31, 2014.", "CapEx was $21 million, and cash restructuring costs were $22 million for the 3 months of Q1 2015. Our updated outlook for 2015 is reflected on Slide 11. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion as compared to our previously provided guidance of $7.4 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9% or nearly $700 million as compared to our previous guidance of approximately 7% or $550 million. Our current outlook assumes a euro rate of $1.10.", "Additionally, our previous outlook included approximately $200 million in sales for the trays and pads business. This disposition does not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and Q1 2015 will continue to include North America trays and pads, but we will have no benefit from this business going forward. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we anticipate an organic growth of approximately 3%. This compares to our previous guidance of approximately 2.5%.", "Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.18 billion. This reflects a slight reduction for the removal of the trays and pads business as well as the increased FX headwinds. Currency is now estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $100 million as compared to our previous forecast of approximately $80 million. If you exclude the FX headwinds and $15 million impact of the divestiture of our trays and pads business, adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been above the high end of our previous range.", "Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.15 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Currency is expected to negatively impact earnings per share by approximately $0.35. Our constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.43 to $2.50. Our interest expense for 2015 is now expected to be $245 million as compared to our previous forecast of $255 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015.", "We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million from $600 million to reflect the lower adjusted EBITDA forecast and higher CapEx, partially offset by lower cash interest payments. Free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million tax refund we received during the first quarter related to the Grace settlement.", "As Jerome mentioned, owning the campus in Charlotte instead of signing a long-term lease is the right economic decision. The decision has led to an increase in our CapEx budget to $210 million from our original forecast of $180 million, of which approximately $75 million is related to these restructuring activities. While the proceeds from the sale of the trays and pads business and the sale of our Racine facility are not part of free cash flow, they have, in fact, resulted in cash receipts. These proceeds will be reflected in investing activities on our cash flow statement, which sits below free cash flow.", "During the quarter, we entered into a cross-currency swap for U.S.-based debt to euro-denominated, increasing our euro-based debt exposure to 14% from the previous 4% level. This transaction, combined with higher cash balances, reduces our cash interest payments to $240 million for the year as compared to our previous expectation of $255 million.", "Other key elements of our free cash flow have not changed. Cash restructuring costs, excluding restructuring CapEx, are still expected to be $120 million. We are on track to recognize $50 million in cost synergies in 2015 from our restructuring efforts.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. But before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 30, at 8:30 a.m. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 18, in New York City. I look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day and to speaking with you again in the future.", "With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from George Staphos, Bank of America.", "George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess my question, Jerome, would be on Diversey Care and the progress you think it's making, particularly whether you think you'll be able to sustain both volume growth and margin improvement in the future. Which regions are you having the most difficulty doing that now?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Thanks, George, very good question. first, we all know that with the size of our business outside of the U.S., in Diversey Care, this is the division which is the most hurt by currency. We had a 9% negative translation in the first quarter at the sales level, which is $45 million, and obviously, this has been hurt most. So the highlights of Diversey Care for the quarter are that we're sustaining now and accelerating our growth in the U.S. You have seen a 4% sales growth, which is really good, and we're continuing to make inroads in that important and large market. Our hospitality market globally has been very strong with double-digit growth, and our health care market in North America has been very, very strong. The -- where we have right now short-term difficulties is probably in Russia and in some parts of the Middle East because the Russians were traveling a lot and were spending a lot in hospitality. And given the local political and economic situation, you have a little bit of reduction of that, which is affecting Dubai, for example, and affecting also tourism within Russia. And this is short-term because we believe it is going to be turning around. With regards to China, the first quarter, we had middle-digit growth -- middle-single-digit growth in Diversey Care in China, and this is a little bit of a disappointment because we're used to double-digit growth. But this is mostly coming from the fact that we have -- that the new hotel opening, because of the real estate crisis in China, has been much slower than in the past. We are growing nicely in restaurants and quick service with local chains. Some international chains have been hurt in the recent past, but we also expect that this is going to get much better. Brazil is a region where the whole company and the result of the whole economy has been hurt, including Diversey Care. And again, you know the economic environment there and the very strong devaluations. All of those things, nevertheless, make me very positive. We had 6% EBITDA growth in constant currency in Diversey Care. We have lots of innovation. The Intellibot, which is a startup, is not going to impact sales, but it is going to have a midterm tremendous benefit on our business, and we are growing where we really want to grow. Hospitality, health care and so on are very important segments for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McNulty, CS.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A question to start out is really around resin. I think there was a lot of concerns that with resin prices or oil falling, you might have to start giving back price, and it looks like in the quarter, that really wasn't much of an issue. Now we're already starting to see resin push back higher, in some cases. So I guess, can you walk us through how the conversations with customers are progressing around that topic and also maybe how to think about the price versus raw material mix going forward over the next couple of quarters?", "Jerome A. Peribere", "Let me start with that one, John, and good morning. You've seen what we've been doing on price/mix in the divisions which are quite exposed to resins, which are Food Care and Product Care. But we've done -- in Food Care, we've done 2.8% price/mix in the first quarter. The very bulk of it, the very large majority of this 2.8% is price. You've seen what we've done in Product Care, and we've been doing 3.4% in the whole -- sorry, I made a mistake. In North America, in Food Care, we had a price/mix of 2.8%. In the total company, we had a price/mix for Food Care globally of 3.8%. In -- and again, the very large majority is in price. In Product Care, globally, it's 3.4%. In North America, it's 4.2%. So we are very active on price. And the reason is that I keep on saying, and our customers accept that when we talk, have good conversations on the value we create, is that in most of the cases, our packaging costs, be in Product Care or be in Food Care, have a negative cost. What I mean by negative cost is that the cost of damage coming from either products being broken in Product Care or the cost of food waste as a result of shelf life, et cetera, et cetera, is much higher than the cost of the packaging. As a result of that, it is not about reducing the cost of our package by $0.01, $0.02, et cetera, et cetera; it is about reducing that food waste and reducing the damage. These are the serious conversations that we're having with our customers, which allow us to price for value, and this is extremely important there. And maybe Ken can add something here and give some color.", "Kenneth P. Chrisman", "Thanks, Jerome. From a Product Care perspective, we saw 4.2% growth price/mix in North America, Q1. That's really a result of great pricing discipline on our general packaging side of our business. As Jerome highlighted, dim weight is coming into play in North America in a way that it had not previously. Our ability to be able to communicate the value of our packaging is taking -- is diminishing a lot of pressure about price. There is some pressure on price, but we've been able to address that by communicating clearly our value. We also see a very favorable mix shift as we spend time working in the direction of higher-performance solutions in our performance packaging portfolio. So that combination has certainly worked favorably for us in Q1, and we expect to see that working as we go forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili, Macquarie.", "Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research", "I just wanted to follow up on John's question, previous question. Maybe, Ken, to you on the Product Care side, it seems like there's some pretty sizable recent resin inflation in Europe, which has historically been kind of one of the tougher Product Care areas to operate. And I wanted to see how you though you are equipped to handle that. And then offhand, if you could, I think within the 2% volume decline, how the performance packaging performed.", "Kenneth P. Chrisman", "Al, thanks for that question. In the first quarter, we saw overall price/mix growth in Europe of 2.4%. Unlike North America, where much of that was in price, in Europe, much of it was really in mix. So a lot of movements. We do expect our price to continue to see improvement in Europe, but the mix, the upselling, the selling value is really where we're seeing benefits in our European business. So our profitability is growing there very rapidly. We're still going through some customer and product rationalization in general packaging, but overall, the effect of some new products and a favorable mix is driving success for us in Europe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi, Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Look forward to seeing the robots in action at the analyst meeting.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "You will.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I guess my question is this: Just given all the changes in your portfolio over the past 3 years, asset sales, customer rationalization initiatives, et cetera, can you give us an updated sense as to how to think about your current volume baseline versus what you think are normalized levels across each of your segments? And maybe we could just start with Protective Packaging, just given your guest speaker there.", "Kenneth P. Chrisman", "So we think about our volume, what's working right now -- and that's a great question. The new product -- the investments that we're making in our business across the board in innovation are where we expect to see our growth coming from. So as we are disciplined in price, we're seeing sales growth that way. We're now starting to see how we're going to be able to secure ongoing volume growth. And it's because of new products, it's because of the portfolio. We have the most robust product portfolio of new products in performance packaging Product Care that we've ever seen. And we do expect that to drive our portfolio going forward. Also, the dedicated sales team in e-commerce is also a significant driver. As we look at markets, the biggest change in Product Care is a de-emphasis of product and an emphasis on markets. So when we look at e-commerce, third-party logistics and electronics, we're putting more effort and resource in those spaces, and they're growing faster than the market. We also say this affects the volume trends we're reporting, but it's important to note that excluding the rationalization efforts, we are experiencing healthy single-digit volume growth.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "On the Food Care side, we have had a very nice volume growth in the first quarter. And interestingly enough, this is as a result also of Australia, which saw our sales growth at about 12% in the first quarter, but this is not sustainable. The kill rate of cattle is extremely high at this point in time, and over the coming quarters, this rate is going to have to go down and so -- and this will slightly affect our sales in there. But generally speaking, the -- we are happy with the chicken market in North America. It's been doing very well, and we had nice, very nice growth. But we also had a lot of new products. We have Darfresh [ph] launched extremely successfully in Europe, which is going to be launched in the second quarter in North America. We have our Optidur line in Europe, which has been launched, and we are going to also accelerate our -- we're going to ramp up in the U.S. soon. We had very nice volume market penetration in Russia in a very difficult environment, in Eastern Europe also. So we're quite happy about this, but altogether, we are expecting to see, towards the latter part of the year, a little bit of volume increase compared to what we have today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research Partners.", "James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "It's James Armstrong for Chip. My question is on the CapEx. According to Slide 11, it's up about $30 million. Could you help us with the total cost of the Charlotte campus and how this spending will flow? And offsetting that, what are the proceeds of the Racine, Wisconsin building sale and also the trays/pads business?", "Carol P. Lowe", "So we're not going to disclose the trays/pads business at this time. We held in the cash flow statement that it's approximately $25 million, so that will be -- that is broken out. There's some additional amount that may be added to that, that are in escrow when we vacate the building later this year, so -- but it's approximately $25 million. In terms of the total value for the Charlotte campus, it's estimated approximately around $120 million, with part of that being paid in 2015, and the remainder will be paid in 2016.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Ng, Jefferies.", "Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "This is Alex Hutter on for Phil. In Product Care, can you talk about the margin differential in general versus performance? And maybe help us quantify that. And then how do you see that progressing with the 60-40 split you talked about as you move towards your longer-term margin goals?", "Kenneth P. Chrisman", "Okay, great question. I will say that performance packaging has better margin performance than general packaging, which is why we're emphasizing that space. We are putting more resource into our performance packaging business across the globe to drive its growth, and we are working on rationalizing our general packaging business to ensure that we have the right total cost, that we have the best cost to serve in that market space. Also say with the strategy, we're able to focus on critical growth sectors in e-commerce, 3PL and electronics. Some of that does lift general packaging, but it lifts the growth part of general packaging as our system solutions, paper systems, inflatable bubble are our higher-value systems in general packaging.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Manuel, Wells Fargo.", "Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Gabe on. Carol, I guess this question will be for you, kind of housekeeping with respect to CapEx. If there's -- how much in the CapEx guidance, I guess, is reflected -- or for the new Charlotte facility? And then if I subtract out the $75 million of restructuring spend that's embedded in the $210 million, I'm coming up with $105 million. What is the sort of maintenance CapEx? And then implicit in that would be sort of return-oriented capital. And can you tell us where you're spending some of that -- those dollars by region or product line?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Yes. Thank you, Gabe. So basically, the increase in CapEx to go from our previous $180 million to $210 million, that's all being driven by the new campus in Charlotte. So that's the spend -- approximately the spend for 2015. I would like to note that one of the reasons that the decision makes sense from an economic standpoint is what Jerome emphasized: that the campus includes our largest R&D center. And the cost for an R&D center as compared to a regular office building is significantly different. It's more than twice the cost. We will reap the value of this investment, but it makes it difficult when you come to trying to do what would be a triple net lease or standard lease. No lessor is going to want to finance that because it's not necessarily transferable to someone else if you vacated the building. So the cost we would have paid on a net lease basis would have been significantly higher than our cash cost even with an interest burden. And at the end of the lease period, we would end up owning nothing, whereas we will own this asset, and it will be very valuable for our future as a company to attract talent and to support innovation and growth for the company. With respect to sort of maintenance CapEx, it really runs less, slightly under $100 million. So everything that you're seeing this year between that $100 million to $180 million, including restructuring investments, has a very positive return for the company. So some of the focus above and beyond the maintenance CapEx, we obviously are always investing to improve the quality of our products. We're investing in capital that helps us with our innovation, such as producing the Darfresh On Tray. We also are investing to make sure our assets are located in the right regions where we have growth. So we've said that we expect our growth to be disproportionately higher in our developing regions, such as Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. So that's where a lot of focus for our investments are headed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde, BMO Capital Markets.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "I'm just curious, Carol, kind of following on CapEx. As growth continues to accelerate offshore and in some of those emerging markets, are you going to need to increase kind of the capital budget to fund that growth on new sites?", "Carol P. Lowe", "No. Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Actually no, we feel like -- we've always said we expect our capital to run somewhere around $200 million a year, giving us plenty of room for maintenance CapEx, quality investment as well as innovation investment, and we don't really expect that to change. For next year, we'll have slightly high -- we'll have higher CapEx because of the restructuring that we've communicated on, which also will include the remainder for the Charlotte campus. But we feel like that $200 million, based on the current business, is plenty to fund us. And actually, if you look at our spend trend, we typically fall well below that, absent any restructuring spend, and have very healthy investments from an innovation standpoint. And as a reminder, the Diversey Care business is very low on capital intensity. And also, if you look at our investment requirements for CapEx relative to a lot of our peers, we have a much lower requirement for investment of our total operating cost relative to our peers, yet we produce some of the highest returns in the industry. So in terms of getting the value out of our capital, I'd put us at the very top of the list.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.", "Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Jerome, a couple of questions, if you haven't touched on this before. One, can you tell us what the EBITDA was for the trays business that was sold?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Well, Alex, what we have shared is that -- Jerome noted early on in his comments at the beginning of the call that the business was facing a lot of competitive pricing pressure, had quickly become commoditized because of certain low-value entrants into the marketplace. And so the business was on track to head below 10% fully burdened EBITDA margin. It had performed higher than that in the past, and what we shared in terms of our guidance is that removing the pads and trays business has resulted in a reduction of our EBITDA estimates, our adjusted EBITDA estimates, for the full year of about $15 million.", "Jerome A. Peribere", "So the reason for this disposition is fairly obvious. That's not the kind of company I want to have or portfolio I want to have. If you produce those trays, you have to have state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment, which we didn't have, and you have to have a very lean company with no R&D and with no service. That's not who we are. We are fastly moving towards becoming a knowledge-based company, which is selling value. And this is why, interestingly enough, you're seeing in the same quarter, you're seeing a disposition of a commodity product and an acquisition of a technology. And you're going to see the same trend in terms of acquisitions in the future, startups or specific technologies which are going to help us become who we want to become.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from at Anthony Pettinari, Citi.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Maybe just a follow-up for Ken, referencing the dedicated e-commerce sales force. I was wondering if it's possible to give any color in terms of the level of growth you're seeing in e-commerce. Maybe to ask the question in other way, I think at the Analyst Day, you said e-commerce was about 12% of segment sales. With the growth that you've been seeing there and the rationalizations in general use packaging, is there a way to kind of size what percentage of Product Care could be e-commerce in the next couple of years?", "Kenneth P. Chrisman", "Anthony, that's a great question. Well, we are working on determining exactly how big e-commerce is. It's such a -- we're having a bit of a challenge making sure we define it properly. A lot of people claim they're e-commerce that aren't. We're really looking for things like value-added warehouse and distribution, companies that are doing fulfillment where they can take advantage of our small parcel packaging solutions. We've put dedicated resources in North America, Europe and China, specifically in e-commerce, because it is growing so fast. But not just growing fast, what we're seeing is it's becoming more sophisticated. The requirements for packaging used to just be the lowest-cost packaging is all they need. Now it really is becoming an extension of the retail experience. So that's why we are putting more resource in the space. It is growing faster than the underlying market, so it deserves consideration from that standpoint. But now that market e-commerce is maturing to a point where our value story and our performance packaging solutions are starting to resonate in a way that, historically, we had some challenge getting some traction. So that's why we are putting dedicated resource, significant amount of resource, specifically into this market effort.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Brian Lalli, Barclays.", "Brian Lalli - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two-part question. You, in your cash flow statement, showed that you bought 69 million of shares through the quarter-end. I believe this leaves you with about 20 million of capacity for the rest of the year. I guess, one, at this phase, is it safe to assume you've exhausted most of this remaining capacity in April? And then secondly, I guess, does finally reaching maybe the point of having limited capacity for buybacks change your thoughts around the cost of refinancing those higher costs? Notes -- again, on September, I think, of next year, and then I guess maybe how do you weigh -- or how does the board weigh the cost of this versus potentially the delayed opportunity to deploy that excess cash and keep leverage between 3.5x to 4x?", "Carol P. Lowe", "Thank you, Brian. So at this point, we have used just about all of our restricted payment baskets. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we were committed to this 3.5x to 4x leverage target. We feel like it is the optimal level. And based then on our cash flow guidance and our strong cash flow-producing capabilities, we will be looking for options to return value to shareholders. As we have shared in the past, we look at kind of a net present value impact in terms of refinancing. And when we get within probably a 50-basis-point differential, knowing that interest rates can move one way or another, we will take a slightly negative impact. And rates have been very attractive, so we are looking more frequently at our opportunities to be able to return value to shareholders.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today.

Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Sealed Air Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I would now turn the conference over to your host for today, Lori Chaitman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports, Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 11 AM today.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you, Lori. And good morning, everyone. Our comments today will focus on the second quarter and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July.", "First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. To quickly recap, we outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy.", "We have executed on many Get Fit programs to-date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models, and disruptive innovation. You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination, it is a journey. And that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique knowhow, resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created.", "Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes that extended maturities, increased covenants flexibility, and reduced our annualized interest expense. With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders.", "And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. At this point, I'm sure that you've had a chance to review our press release and earnings results for the second quarter.", "Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America tray and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price mix, lower input costs, and manufacturing improvements.", "Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million, or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 280 basis points with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis.", "Let me now turn to slide four where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food Care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%. And in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronic sectors.", "The Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as reported basis as a result of currency devaluation. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4%, and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries was offset by a slight decline in the UK and in Switzerland. The nine countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales.", "In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline of 5% on an as reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care, India and Southeast Asia were up 8%, and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil.", "Let's now turn to slide five, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division in the second quarter. Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price mix was 2.7% and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil.", "Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%, APAC increased 5%, EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico; and mid to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. We experienced constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, two countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7%, primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business.", "In North America, cattle production was down 8%, which was offset by mid single-digit growth in smoked and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. Our fresh red meat business was up slightly and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance was a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall in North America, we had favorable price mix and volume growth.", "For the remainder of the year, we expect continued decline in the beef market, but at the decelerating rate than that we have been experiencing over the last nine to 12 months. In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new, very successful products, resulted in a 4.5% constant dollar growth rate in our European food packaging business. We are experiencing increased demand for Darfresh on Tray and OptiDure and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach.", "Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives, and cost synergies.", "Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slaughter rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that.", "Some of these external focus also include economic challenges in Brazil and Venezuela, and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned. We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year, but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion.", "Slide six highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price mix was up 2.2% and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia Pacific was up 3.5% and EMEA over 2%. From an end-market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and healthcare, and we also experienced increased demand in our distribution channels.", "EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey, positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and instability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai.", "In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, would have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. North America accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth with increasing demand from our hospitality and healthcare segments.", "In Asia Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Brazil.", "Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million, or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter. And as we anticipate, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter, and on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities.", "For example, we're already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot, and are having many conversations with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we're accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into year-end. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we're still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year.", "Slide seven highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price mix of just over 1% on volumes that declined nearly 2%. Favorable price mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global \u2013 both global performance packaging and general packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted in fact by rationalization efforts in Latin America and to a lesser extent also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions, and should be mostly behind us by mid 2016.", "On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid to high single-digits. Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now.", "On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future, given our product breadth, global reach, and focused investment in performance-based packaging.", "And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of global performance packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well.", "And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, and outlook. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide eight, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price mix was 2.4%, or $48 million, and volume was up 1%, or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million, or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as reported basis were down 9.6%.", "Turning to slide nine, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4% as reported to $308 million, or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $58 million.", "Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divesture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA, and unfavorable currency translation was $34 million.", "Despite currency headwind, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period.", "Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year.", "Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter 2014. In the first quarter 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rate. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions.", "In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares. And as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares.", "Now, turning to slide 10, we outlined our price mix, volume trends, and sales price on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care and, excluding rationalization effort, in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil, as Jerome previously referenced, and our rationalization effort in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth.", "Turning to slide 11, you can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first six months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the six months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management.", "As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250 basis point improvement compared to June 30, 2014.", "CapEx was $58 million and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the six months ending June 30, 2015.", "Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on slide 12. We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9%, or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%.", "Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We're now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. We want you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at $1.34 and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at $1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure includes Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and Australian dollar.", "Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 to $2.58, without the impact of currency.", "As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28.", "We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million. And cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activities. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. But before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27, at 10 A.M.", "Operator, can you please open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Sure. Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Can you first off update us on the volume outlook for each of the segments for the back half of the year? On protective packaging, do you think it'll remain down for the rest of the year? Diversey, there seems to be some momentum, should we expect that to continue into the back half? And also in Food, do you see any deviation from the first half volume run rate, anything else that we should think about? Thanks so much.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, good question, Ghansham. The volumes are there except in Product Care, but this is mostly the results of rationalization. So, what we had is a negative almost 2.5% globally in the first quarter in Product Care, and now it's about 1%. We're seeing this improve over time, and probably in the second half, definitely we are going to be hitting the e-commerce season and we're putting lots of efforts in some very specific sectors in there. And I must say that we are having or we are on the verge of having some pretty nice customer wins and so. We also are introducing quite nice new products, which have a lot of momentum. And this is in both equipment and in the new products themselves. So I would be \u2013 I'm quite positive that the very forceful efforts put by Ken and his forceful leadership are going to bring pretty good results.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And Food Care?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "On Food Care \u2013 but on Food Care, it's quite interesting. We have had nice volume growth in an environment which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meat market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet.", "In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses which have been closing. I think the number is 15; JBS has recently published that they have closed five. And this is the result of drought, high prices of red meat at the cattle level, reducing purchasing power, and you know that red meat is an expensive meat and, as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we are going to see \u2013 we're carefully optimistic \u2013 but the poultry market has been good for us and we expect that it is going to continue being good.", "Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And OptiDure, Darfresh on Tray are doing absolutely wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth, not as much in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter, but we believe that it's going to be okay.", "Diversey has been improving its volume. And we had flat volume in Q1; we had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Scott.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just looking at the change in EBITDA year-to-date, you put up about $114 million of mix and price-cost spread. Can you talk about that a little bit? How much is really coming from mix, how much is coming from price-cost spread, and how should we expect that to trend in the second half of the year?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So Scott, we really \u2013 we don't break that out \u2013 and I know Jerome will have a comment as it relates to some of our input costs. But we would expect for the second half of the year, and specifically with Food Care, we will have a benefit from some lower input costs. But at the same time, as everyone's aware, we do have the formula pricing for Food Care, as Jerome referenced in this opening remarks. And so that will narrow that positive price cost spread that we'll see in the second half compared to the first half. So, Jerome, I don't know if you want to make any specific comment.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I always like to \u2013 in a growing \u2013 in an increasing raw material environment, it is very important to see whether you've got price increases and whether you've got price. In a decreasing environment, and we have had that compared to 12 months ago, with resin, what is important is mostly to see whether you get margin expansion or whether you don't, to see \u2013 to look at your pricing discipline. The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter, but we've got positive pricing, and that is important.", "That lead me to the second half and the resin prices. There have been attempts in North America to raise resin prices in July, it's not going through. And we'll see what August gives. But the volume overall is \u2013 and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena, olefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there's going to be major price increases. And as a result of that, what we're going to be seeing is formula pricing gets its impact during the third quarter.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, Scott, I'll add to that just that when we referenced pricing, it isn't necessarily general across the board pricing increases. We've communicated frequently that we're being very focused in understanding the value that we're bringing to our customers, helping them understand that. And so some of our pricing actions are just going to our customers and making sure we're getting the value for what we've created. And again, just to emphasize it, it's very specific based on the values that we're bringing. So from that standpoint, there is a portion of it that is \u2013 it really is definitely mix because it's higher value solutions that we're bringing to the marketplace.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO. Please proceed.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah. I wondered, Jerome, if you can just talk about the impact of FX in terms of just sort of changing mix within any of your businesses as we look around the globe? For example, you would think that the weaker currency would be helping like fresh meat exports from places like Australia and Brazil.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So what you do have is \u2013 so I'm starting with Australia and Brazil and stuff. Yes, normally you should have that. It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil, which I have made comments recently saying that not only the local market is very weak, their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally a lower real should help, but it seems that the export markets are fairly weak.", "With regards to Australia, the slaughter rates of the herds has been double-digits in the first quarter and is slightly coming down. And the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth \u2013 very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not \u2013 the first quarter was, if I remember well, double-digits and here we're talking about high single-digit.", "With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first quarter and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing \u2013 that we are forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that, because with oil being very low, with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be \u2013 have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar \u2013 versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious, because the real is \u2013 was yesterday, I didn't check today, but it was at BRL 3.36 versus a forecast of \u2013 or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about BRL 2.22, BRL 2.23 and versus the second quarter this year at BRL 3.10. So we have to be careful there.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Jerome, I had a couple of question again on volume. I guess, first of all, if possible, can you comment at all how much of the decline in Product Care was related to the downturn in manufacturing electronics, as you term it, how much of it was rationalization? And if I could tack on a part two, in Diversey, it was nice to see the volume growth there. Could you provide a bit more color in terms of what initiatives are working? Are you getting any actual traction in terms of volumes from things like Internet of Clean and robotics or is that just increasing the interest? Thank you.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Good to hear from you, George. Good question, again. The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would exclude voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business and, as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business, which was really unprofitable and, therefore, we just \u2013 we did that out.", "Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America, should the electronic business be more positive. And actually it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the \u2013 those kind of devices consumption, it's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum in 3PL and e-commerce, and we are introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months.", "On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing, because the trend is a positive trend, and we're having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We think we had a bad quarter for all kind of reasons at the beginning of the year in Canada. We're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter one and quarter two, I'm just seeing a trend. So these are not businesses which turn around very quickly, because customer wins and the share of wallet at the customer is just a long-term process, but I'm positive.", "So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera, Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. These are not big products today. We are starting \u2013 we're having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably. But you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of this.", "Intellibot, I can tell you how happy I am, I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, pickup in our sales, and we are investing a lot. We're going to lose money in 2015 out of this Intellibot operations, because in fact we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually this is going to impact the second half of the year. But I'm very happy with that.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. Impressive quarter, congratulations on that front. You mentioned the contractual pass-through will kick in a little more fully in the back half for Food Care. Should we still expect positive pricing in that business and the amount of pricing you're seeing in Product Care? Is this a good level, especially with a potential uptick in the back half from a favorable mix?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, well, formula pricing is going to have a negative impact on our pricing in Food Care in the third quarter, there is no doubt about that. So I think it's important. We have had positive pricing in the U.S. specifically, because formula pricing is mostly in the U.S. or in North America, I should say. We have seen in Q1 and Q2 the price only just \u2013 the percentage increase come down because we have positive pricing \u2013 and I think it's going to continue to come down in the third quarter for the mechanical reason I just talked to you about.", "With regards to Product Care, we are seeing \u2013 we're having price increases \u2013 but again, not as much. And the main reason I told you earlier is that when you have an environment where the resins don't go up, and when they have been going down, if you retain pricing, you have margin expansion, you don't have price.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning. This is (46:42) for John McNulty. Just one question, on the cash flow front. What should we think about your ability to further improve working capital throughout the remainder of the year, through either efficiency improvement, inventory management, other things you could do?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, good morning and thank you. So in terms of the working capital, what we had previously discussed was that for the full year of 2015, we were expecting a little bit more than $100 million positive contribution from working capital and other. And so, you can think somewhere between probably $100 million to $120 million. It will depend on, obviously, our activity within Q4. That will drive receivables and payables, but somewhere between $100 million and $120 million for the full year.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss the realization of the European price hikes you announced in the quarter, if you were satisfied with the progress there. And then if you could just talk generally about price-cost in Europe, maybe views on the second half? Price mix in Europe has been positive; that's lagged the company a little bit. Is that just a tilt towards Diversey or if could you just give some color there?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, yes, we announced a price increase. We have \u2013 and this is on the back of resin prices which have increased in March and April and May \u2013 and we have had favorable responses on this situation. And we don't think that there are going to be much more \u2013 or there's going to be price increases on olefins in the rest of the year. So just to cut the story short, yes, we have had price in EMEA as a result of oil price increases.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please proceed.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes, good morning, Jerome. Question I had for you all was, basically looking at the two things. One, the pace of the buybacks certainly in July was quite strong, and it looks like if you kept that pace, you would actually use up the authorization in about another eight or nine months. Now, I don't want to pin you down, but would you be disappointed that if you didn't have the opportunity to complete that buyback, say, by the end of next year? Is that a fair statement?", "And then, if Carol could just talk a little bit about the amortization that's very elevated at Diversey, does that at some point start to come down? I know it's not a cash flow issue, but it would be an earnings issue as we look at the out-years?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. So, thank you, Chip. So with the share repurchase program, as you know, the program itself does not have an expiration date, and the board authorized the $1.5 billion share buyback program. We're active in the market. We have the 10b5 program. And I've discussed at the Analyst Day how a lot of companies think they can time these things and it doesn't necessarily prove out. So, we're just being very prudent in how we have structured the program, so they can operate automatically when we have our blackout period and things like that, and we'll just continue to operate that way. So, the market will determine whether that $1.5 billion in shares is used quicker or if it takes more time. That's really going to largely depend on a lot of the market dynamics.", "And with respect to the amortization, we are \u2013 obviously, what you see with Diversey Care is the amortization of the intangibles that was acquired through the Diversey acquisition. And we will see a decrease in that as we go forward. But for example, if we look at the amortization of intangibles for 2014, it was approximately $120 million and for 2015, it's approximately $95 million. So we will continue to see that come down around that scale.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from Mark Wilde. Please proceed.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yeah, Jerome, just curious, you're mostly focused on kind of taking the company ahead. I wonder if there are any remaining portfolio moves just in terms of cleanup. You have a lot of equity interests in different business. I think you've got some assets like small paper mills out in Pennsylvania. Any more moves in just sort of portfolio cleansing?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually, probably not. If we do things, they're going to be smaller ones or really non-core. So that's the way I'm thinking about it. It might be a product line that we believe is either distracting us or it might be a given little product in a given country. The challenge I'm putting to our division leaders is that when we have something that we don't believe we can fix and is distracting us is we should that action. And the reason is that we all know that non-profitable things or non-profitable businesses or product lines are in fact taking the bulk of our time.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And Mark, I'll add just one thing. You referenced that we have some equity investments. The company previously has had a variety of joint ventures, small in scale or some equity investments largely around specific types of innovation. And one thing, when Jerome joined the company and he really emphasized and we talked about it publicly is that our investments \u2013 we were going to make sure that we could realize a good return. And we went through a process of analyzing all of those investments and where we did not see opportunity for a fair return and we had been investing in those ventures sometimes three-plus years, we made decisions to exit. And we have exited substantially all of those equity investments that were not wholly-owned.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So the focus is on margin and profitable growth. That's where the focus is. We know that we can fix things. So priority one is to see whether a given product line in a given country is core or non-core. If it is non-core, it's got to be disproportionately profitable. And if it's core, we have proven to ourselves then we can fix things. And if after being fixed, they are still disproportionately less profitable then we take action.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Sure. Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my follow-on. I guess, Jerome, to the extent that you can in a public forum, can you size or provide a bit more qualitative commentary on what you're doing in 3PL and e-commerce in terms of what kind of impact that you have back half of 2015 and into 2016? Thank you.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, good question, and welcome back. Ken Chrisman has been very outspoken during our Analyst Day as to where he is taking this division. And we are intervening a lot on dim weights and we are intervening a lot on helping e-commerce companies and third-party logistics to be more productive. So, on dim weight, we have fabulous solutions to create value to third-party logistics and e-commerce companies in their fulfillment operations. And as a result of that \u2013 and by the way, stay tuned, because we are taking actions that we're going to publish soon on those things. But there is very key that for everybody to understand that dim weights is a problem to anybody which ships something, and we have the solutions to help them there. So is this an on/off and immediate action? Not necessarily, but we're making progress every single day.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you all for joining our call today. Operator, I'll pass it back to you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

My name is Latoya and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investors Relations, Ms. Lori Chaitman. Please proceed.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 11 AM today.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I'm sure that you have had the chance to review our press release and earnings results for the third quarter. And I'm very pleased with our performance across all divisions, despite the significant currency headwinds and slowdown in emerging markets.", "Net sales of $1.75 billion increased 2.7% on an organic basis, which excludes both FX and the impacts from the North American trays and pads divestiture. We experienced organic or constant dollar sales growth in each of our regions in both Food Care and Diversey Care. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million or 17.2% of net sale, essentially unchanged on an as-reported dollar basis, and an increase of approximately 16% in an organic basis.", "We delivered 190 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, with improvements across each of our three divisions. And free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was $331 million. And as we head into year-end, we will continue to focus on growth opportunities within our divisions and regions, while at the same time stayed very disciplined on our pricing strategies and cost management to offset currency headwinds.", "Before I pass the call on to Carol and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, for more details on the quarter and outlook, I want to briefly highlight a few items. As we have communicated many times, we are very committed to a disciplined approach to portfolio management with a focus on innovation and becoming a knowledge-based company. To further solidify our position in the growing e-commerce market, we acquired B+ Equipment in early August, a startup company headquartered in France that designs, manufactures and services revolutionary automated packaging systems for order fulfillment operations.", "With this acquisition, we will add B+'s flagship I-Pack system and its recently introduced e-Cube system to our industry-leading portfolio of packaging solutions focused on cube optimization and fulfillment velocity.", "More recently, we completed the sale of our European trays business, a non-core asset within our Food Care division. Similar to our comments around the North American trays and pads business, the European trays business has commoditized and was also facing competitive pricing pressure. This business generated $71 million in sales in 2014 and $44 million in the first nine months of 2015.", "With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jerome. On slide four, we present our performance by region for the third quarter. Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA was our fastest-growing region with 4% constant dollar growth. Latin America and Asia Pacific both delivered 3% growth. And on an organic basis, North America was up just over 1%.", "In EMEA, we continue to see strong constant dollar growth in Russia and Turkey with 39% and 10% growth respectively. In Western Europe, we delivered 7% growth in Spain and approximately 3% to 4% growth in Italy and Holland. France, Germany and the UK were flat compared to last year. These eight countries in our EMEA region account for approximately 23% of our total net sales.", "In Latin America, we had strong constant dollar performance in Mexico and Argentina with 17% growth and nearly 30% growth, respectively. These growth trends were offset by expected weakness in Brazil, which declined 7%, as well as the region being impacted by the collapse of Venezuela.", "Asia-Pacific was led by 6% growth in Australia and 3% growth in New Zealand. As we anticipated, China, which accounts for approximately 3% of net total sales, was soft and declined by 1%. In North America, Diversey Care delivered 8% followed by 2% in Food Care and a decline of 4% in Product Care.", "In Diversey Care, more than 4% of the growth in the quarter was due to increased demand while the remaining growth came from sales into our distribution channel, which we believe to be a partial pull-forward from the fourth quarter. In Product Care, sales were impacted primarily from our rationalization efforts and pockets of weakness throughout the industrial sectors.", "Turning to slide five, let me walk you through our net sales bridge for the quarter. Favorable price/mix was 2.1% or $42 million on volumes that were up $11 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $230 million or 12% mostly due to year-over-year declines in the euro, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, and the Canadian dollar. Net sales on an organic basis were up 2.7%. And on an as-reported basis, net sales declined 11.6%.", "On slide six, we outline our price/mix, volume, and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Volume trends were up nicely in Diversey Care and essentially flat in Food Care. Excluding rationalization efforts in Product Care, volumes would have also been flat as compared to last year's performance. By region, volume was up in EMEA and Asia Pacific, flat in North America, and down nearly 9% in Latin America.", "On slide seven, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first nine months of the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $300 million or 17.2% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the third quarter of 2014. However, excluding $39 million in unfavorable currency and the impact from the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 15.6%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $36 million and cost synergies of $11 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year despite unfavorable currency and the impact of the divestiture.", "Karl will highlight the adjusted EBITDA performance by division. But I want to mention that our medical business had a strong performance in the quarter and was the primary driver behind the year-over-year improvement in the net expense of medical and corporate, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial table. For the full year, we now expect medical and corporate to be a net expense of approximately $70 million. Adjusted net earnings of $143 million or $0.70 per share compares to adjusted net earnings of $112 million or $0.53 in the third quarter last year.", "Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS in the third quarter 2015 by $0.12. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower core tax rate and share repurchases. The core tax rate for Q3 2015 was 18.8%, as compared with 28% for Q3 2014, which on a year-over-year basis, positively impacted 2015 adjusted EPS in the third quarter by $0.08. The lower core tax rate in the quarter was related to the recording of net foreign tax credit. Year-to-date, our core tax rate was 24.3% and we still anticipate our full year tax rate to be approximately 25%.", "On an as-reported basis, net earnings in the third quarter were $87 million, or $0.42 per share. Net earnings include $57 million of special items, primarily consisting of restructuring and other associated costs, as well as the tax reserve recorded in relation to the $235 million tax refund we received earlier in the year. The net tax reserve recorded in the quarter was $16 million, which reflects the tax reserve on the refund, offset by the release of certain tax reserves recorded at the time of the Diversey Care acquisition.", "In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares, for a total value of approximately $576 million, using a combination of open market and ASR. Share repurchases had a year-over-year favorable impact on adjusted EPS of $0.03. Year-to-date, we repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares for a total value of $726 million.", "I will now turn the call over to Karl, who will provide you with a more detailed review of Food Care, as well as highlight the performance of Diversey Care and Product Care.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Thanks, Carol. So, let's turn our attention to slide eight, which highlights results for our Food Care division. In the third quarter, Food Care sales increased 3.1% on an organic basis, with growth across all regions. Favorable price/mix was 2.8% on essentially flat volumes. We had favorable price/mix trends and, more importantly, positive volume trends in every region except Latin America where volume was negatively impacted by general political and economic conditions in Brazil and Venezuela. Excluding Latin America, volume would have been up approximately 2% to 3% globally.", "Our results in price/mix demonstrate our global pricing disciplines, as well as our success managing pricing in countries where currency devaluations have occurred. Europe, Middle East, Africa, or EMEA, delivered 5% constant-dollar growth. Russia continues to be our fastest-growing country due to the strength of penetration of the protein markets, as well as adoption of our advanced packaging solutions. Our business in Western Europe is benefiting from a slowly recovering economy where demand for beef is increasing. In addition, we are experiencing strong acceptance of our new products, particularly our Darfresh on Tray and some of our new advanced ready-meal solutions.", "In Latin America, sales were up 3.4% in constant dollars. Double-digit constant dollar growth in Mexico and Argentina more than offset expected weaknesses in Brazil and Venezuela. In Brazil, our business has been negatively impacted by the decline in local beef consumption due to the economic environment, the decline in the export market and the fact that cattle producers have recently started to rebuild their herds in light of the current market conditions. Also, the sociopolitical factors in Venezuela are having a very significant impact on our business.", "Despite these short-term challenges, we strongly believe that over the long-term Latin America and specifically Brazil, where the herd sizes double the size of North America is a solid growth opportunity for Food Care. Asia-Pacific was up 4% in constant dollars as a result of 6% growth in Australia and 5% growth in New Zealand. Since the second quarter of 2014, on average, we have been experiencing high-single-digit growth in Australia where slaughter rates have been at unsustainably high levels. As we previously indicated, we are now seeing the Australian cattle producers start to rebuild their herds after nearly three years of drought-induced liquidation.", "Consequently, we are planning for weaker sales trends in Australia in the upcoming quarters. In New Zealand, we have been experiencing above-market growth. However, we believe this growth is not sustainable due to the impact of the depressed global dairy markets. In North America, despite continued mid-single-digit declines in the cattle market, we delivered 2% organic sales growth with nearly 1% volume growth in favorable price/mix. This quarter, our growth in North America was predominantly driven by strength in poultry, smoked and processed meats and fluid-based packaging as a result of a very strong tomato season in California.", "Fresh red meat was relatively flat due to continued adoptions of our advanced product portfolio. It's worth noting that the broad acceptance of these new products is driving our above-market growth in North America. I also want to mention that cattle producers continue to rebuild their herds as evidenced by the continued heifer retention. While we continue to anticipate the cattle market to be weak in quarter four and the first half of 2016, there is a strong indication that the cycle is on track to turn positive in mid 2016. Our global hygiene business delivered solid growth in APAC and EMEA with improved profitability. This growth was partially offset by weaknesses in Latin American market.", "Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance, Food Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $168 million, a 7% increase on an as reported basis and a 10% increase on an organic basis. Currency and the divestiture had a $30 million unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Margins of 20.1% were up 170 basis points, largely due to improved mix of our premium products, global pricing disciplines, and lower input costs. These were partially offset by transactional FX and the divestiture.", "As we head into year-end, we expect further adoption of our new products on a global basis, and we will continue on focusing on adding value-added selling to our customers. However, this will be partially offset by negative formula pricing, particularly in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors. Some of these external factors include ongoing economic challenges in Brazil, Venezuela and the slowdown in Australia where slaughter rates have been at unsustainable levels.", "In quarter four, as reported, adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollars will be down on a year-over-year basis. However, adjusted EBITDA on an organic basis, which excludes FX and the divestiture, is expected to increase in the high single-digits. Given our performance year-to-date and the outlook for quarter four, we are clearly on track to deliver a strong EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the Full Year 2015.", "So I'd like to turn our attention now to slide nine, which highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up approximately 4% in the third quarter. Volume increased 2.5%, with favorable trends in every region, except for Latin America where volume was negatively impacted by weakness in Brazil. Price/mix was favorable 1.4%, primarily driven by pricing initiatives. As Carol indicated earlier, our strongest region in Diversey Care was North America. Our recent customer wins are ramping up nicely and we are continuing to see solid growth in our infection prevention solutions.", "We also had a strong performance in EMEA and APAC with constant dollar sales growth of 3% in the quarter. EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales. We have made significant progress and are seeing stabilizing trends throughout our largest markets in Western Europe. Among our largest customers in EMEA, we're experiencing double-digit growth in Turkey and positive sales in France, Italy, Holland, Germany and Spain. In APAC, we experienced high single-digit growth in India and a slight uptick in China, but all other emerging markets declined.", "Latin America sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged compared to last year's performance. For the second consecutive quarter, performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by high single-digit decline in Brazil. Strength in Argentina and Chile is a result of recent customer wins, growth in equipment sales and increased volume from our distribution partners.", "On the new product front and solutions front, we launched the SURE product line, which is a vegetable-based formula, which is 100% biodegradable and requires no classifications from a regulatory standpoint. We highlighted this at our Analyst Day and we are excited to have it commercially available in the market. Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $66 million or 13.2% of net sales in the quarter. Currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter and on a reported basis.", "Adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by higher volumes, cost synergies, lower SG&A, partially offset by the impact of transactional FX, the Intellibot acquisition, and the significant deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and Brazil. In quarter four, we expect continued organic growth in sales and adjusted EBITDA, but to a lesser extent as compared to quarter three.", "Now let's look at slide 10 which highlights the results of our Product Care division. Net sales were down 1.7% on a constant dollar basis with volume declines of 2.5%, more than offsetting favorable price/mix of 0.8%. Third quarter volume was impacted by rationalization efforts in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our global packaging solutions and should be mostly behind us by mid 2016.", "As Carol highlighted earlier, volume was also impacted by weakness in the industrial sectors in North America. Favorable price/mix continues to be driven by our pricing disciplines across both the global packaging \u2013 performance packaging and general packaging sectors.", "On a regional basis, North America net sales were down nearly 4% in constant dollars, of which half of the decline is attributable to rationalization. Unfavorable trends in the industrial sector, particularly manufacturing and transportation were partially offset by double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics.", "We expect strength in e-commerce and 3PLs to continue in the year-end, which will help offset rationalization and the softer trends in the industrial market. EMEA was up approximately 3% due to increased demand in France and Italy. And it's worth noting that China was up 4%. Performance in China reflects our new leadership in APAC and our renewed targeted efforts to increase market penetration.", "We are seeing strong interest across the globe in our newly acquired B+ portfolio, and we are excited to have the team on board. Both B+ and our recently introduced automatic mailer, or flow wrap, are designed to deliver cube optimization and efficiency savings for the rapidly growing e-commerce and fulfillment markets. The flow wrap solution, which is specifically designed for the e-commerce apparel market, is further evidence of our robust development pipeline of automated solutions.", "Let's turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $81 million, a 9% increase on an as-reported basis and a 16% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1% expanded 340 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of pricing disciplines associated with our value-selling initiatives, an increase of mix of our global performance packaging solutions and lower input costs. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion.", "Now, let me pass the call back to Carol to review our cash flow and our outlook. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Karl. Turning to slide 11, free cash flow was a source of $331 million for the first nine months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund. This compares to a source of $371 million for the nine months ending 2014. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to less cash generated from working capital, the payment of 2014 bonuses, and unfavorable currency. CapEx was $112 million and cash restructuring costs were $72 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2015.", "Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on slide 12. We now expect net sales to be approximately $7 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 10% or $800 million. Excluding the impact of the North America trays and pads divesture and currency, we anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2015 is now expected to be approximately $1.165 billion which is in the midpoint of our previously provided guidance. This reflects our strong performance in the first nine months of 2015 and our outlook into year-end.", "We will continue to face currency challenges and are estimating FX to have a negative impact on full year adjusted EBITDA of approximately $125 million. Keep in mind that in Q3 2014, the euro was at $1.34 and in Q4 2014 the euro was at $1.26. Our year-end forecast assumes that in Q4 2015, the euro remains in line with the Q3 rate of approximately $1.10. Other currencies that have experienced devaluation in recent months and as compared to last year's rates, includes the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar.", "Our interest expense for 2015 is estimated at $235 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $290 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.32. The adjusted EPS impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.36. Our previous guidance for adjusted EPS in 2015 was in the range of $2.24 to $2.28. In 2014, we reported adjusted EPS of $1.86.", "As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares year-to-date. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2015 is based on 207 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full-year effect of the share repurchases completed year-to-date.", "Please note that the divestiture of the European trays business is expected to close in early November. For now, the full-year financial estimates for this business are included in our 2015 outlook. Full-year 2015 sales from the European trays are expected to be approximately $55 million. Similar to the North America trays and pads business, this disposition does not qualify for discontinued operations. Therefore, prior year in the first 10 months of 2015 financials will include results from our European trays business.", "We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $560 million from $585 million. Our free cash flow outlook excludes the $235 million tax refund. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $110 million. We are lowering our capital expenditures from $210 million to $190 million and our cash restructuring payments from $120 million to $110 million.", "Working capital will still be a source of cash, but not at the level we had originally anticipated, largely due to proactive inventory management. We are maintaining higher-than-originally-anticipated inventory levels into year end to support on-time delivery for our customers in order to meet their service requirements.", "In closing, we've made significant progress in 2015, and we will continue to focus on operational improvements and trying (30:50) to mitigate FX and pockets of economic weakness. When we look beyond 2015, our focus is on new product introductions and investing in innovative technologies that will drive sustainable and profitable growth.", "Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter and full year earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, February 10, at 10 AM.", "With that, operator, can we please open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thanks for the details. I guess my first question, Carol, just housekeeping on the tray business. If I understood your comments correctly, it is still included in your guidance for the year. And the reason I ask, the footnote on slide 12, it says it's in there for only the first quarter, which would imply it wasn't for the rest of the year. So, I'm just trying to reconcile that and if you could comment how much EBITDA you'll ultimately lose on an annualized basis from that divestiture?", "And then Karl, good to have you on the call, just could you give us any kind of trajectory on the ability for EBITDA to grow in Food in the first half of the year? Obviously, second half you'll get the benefit from the cattle cycle turning, but how you feel about your ability to grow given \u2013 and tougher comparisons on pricing, you've obviously had a lot of benefit beginning of the year \u2013 in 2015. Thank you.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, and good morning, George. So I'll start with the question. So, the reference for Q1 2015, that relates to our North America trays and pads business. And the reference about the 10 months is the European trays business. So they're two separate transactions with two different buyers as we noted. And we have broken out the EBITDA for the North America trays and pads business that was sold at the beginning of Q2 2015. That's broken out in our bridge.", "You can see that within the Food Care EBITDA bridge. The European business had a similar margin. But what's important to know, as we've highlighted and Karl commented as well, that business has been \u2013 was deteriorating, becoming commoditized, both North America and Europe, and Europe even more so. So, the margins were quickly headed below 10%, as well as the product not meeting some of our sustainability requirements. Karl?", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Okay. So, thank you for the question. We obviously strategically have plans to continue to improve our EBITDA. I mean, we made a significant improvement to the 20.1% level we're at today. We continue to introduce new products that positively impact our EBITDA. We continue to clean up our portfolio, as just evidenced from the tray discussion. We continue to reduce some levels of liters. We've had significant improvement in the profitability of our Hygiene business in regions for the world. We continue to manage our expenses. So, our outlook is to continue to improve and grow our EBITDA.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, a question, I guess, on the cash flow side. It sounds like you're building up inventories, but it almost sounds like you may have been \u2013 maybe \u2013 but you had overcut because you're kind of implying like you're trying to build them back up so you can meet your customers' needs. Is that the case or am I misreading that?", "And then, I guess the second thing is, as you look into 2016, can we expect further improvements in working capital? And how should we be thinking about some of the puts and takes in 2016, like the restructuring costs starting to wind down, et cetera? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Thank you, John. I guess it's not really that we have been too aggressive in reducing inventory. An important piece of the build that we think we need to do, or really not build, but maintaining into Q4, is because we do have a go-live for SAP within our Diversey Care business in North America. And anyone who has been through an SAP implementation and go-live will know that it's very prudent to make sure you maintain appropriate inventory levels.", "It's a great enterprise platform that we'll get a lot of benefit out of that we want to make sure we're cautious and conservative and can meet all of our customer expectations. So, that's one of the key drivers. And we've just taken that decision as we head towards the end of the year with an early Q1 go-live.", "In terms of thinking about color for 2016, we do expect to have a positive impact from working capital and it to be a source of cash in 2016. However, it's important to note, when Jerome and I and the rest of the management team really started focusing on working capital, beginning in 2013, there were some obvious things we could do that would accrue to our benefit from a cash flow standpoint quicker. As we're moving forward, there's less of those obvious steps to take and the move towards the day-in, day-out proper management of working capital to sustain the business. We anticipate growth going forward into 2016. And as such, that will impact working capital. But again, that bottom line, we will expect to see positive source of cash for working capital.", "If we think about EBITDA for 2016, we're still focusing extremely on profitable growth, driving towards our 2018 target of 18% margin that we shared at the Analyst Day in June. Our CapEx for 2016 is still estimated at $275 million. Restructuring, excluding the CapEx restructuring, which is included in the $275 million I shared, is still estimated $110 million to $120 million for 2016.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess, a question on Diversey and the volume improvement you showed in the quarter. Is that coming at the expense of lower mix in any way? I guess, I'm asking because of the $5 million lower price cost/mix you're showing for that segment in your EBITDA waterfall. And just separately, Carol, can you quantify what you expect for working capital for 2015 now versus your original guidance? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, I'll take the working capital first, Ghansham. And if you just do the math and you do a walk from the EBITDA and you pick up the interest payments \u2013 and the EBITDA of $1.165 billion; interest payments of $230 million; cash payments, $110 million; restructuring, $110 million. We've shared previously that SARs are $20 million and the CapEx of $190 million, to get to the $560 million would imply a favorable impact from working capital and other at $55 million. And we had previously estimated that to be somewhere between $100 million and $110 million.", "With respect to the Diversey Care, I guess, for that, when we look at the cost synergies, I mean, that's the $5 million positive that's ongoing benefit that has helped the business in the quarter. With respect to mix and price/cost spread, we do have a meaningful impact from transactional FX that hits Diversey because of different imports of products based on where the demand is at. We had a particularly negative impact in the UK for their business and all driven largely because of transactional FX. So, we're not seeing anything that's concerning us from a deterioration in margin driven by mix.", "And actually, as I highlighted and Karl commented, for North America, we're seeing very positive performance relative to mix as we drive expansion of our North America business, add new customers, and especially with our product as it supports healthcare.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually, this quarter has shown a very nice confirmation of the turnaround of this division. We are firmly into growth now. And we're making inroads where we want to make inroads. Our large business, which is in EMEA, is starting to grow. Our North American business is growing, and the emerging market situation is, whatever it is in terms of environment, but we are very well positioned. There is a very firm, nice turnaround, which is ongoing and which is starting to show its fruits here.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, and congratulations on a strong quarter. Actually, that's kind of along those lines is where I wanted to start with respect to volumes and such. I mean, it looks like when you laid things out at Analyst Day, you talked about 3% to 4% organic volume growth through 2018, I think another point or two from price, and then there were some offsets. And I recognize it's early days, but it seems as though you're doing \u2013 still continuing to push pretty hard on the price meter here in the near-term. As you look forward to next year in 2016, do you think that's when we start to see the inflection on the organic volume side to see it begin to pick up? Or given what you're doing in new product development as such, how do you envision that kind of playing out, Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great question, Chris. First of all, thank you for congratulating us on this quarter. Very frankly, I'm very proud of it. And I'm very proud of it because remember the guidance, we gave you a guidance at the beginning of the year in terms of EBITDA and EPS. We raised it in July. We raised that guidance in July. We then in September, at John's Credit Suisse Conference, we said, watch it, there's an additional headwind of $15 million of currency, and it's going to be really hard to mitigate it. And what are we doing today? We're confirming the July guidance.", "So, I take this as the first time we're increasing \u2013 as the second time we're increasing our guidance. And I'm very pleased with what's going on in an environment which, in emerging countries, because of commodity pricing, ag commodities or mineral pricing, and because of oil and gas prices, et cetera, so \u2013 in all \u2013 in many emerging countries with, but including Australia, Canada, et cetera, are countries where the environment is not easy. And remember that in that environment, we have \u2013 we are increasing our EBITDA. And at the very same time, we are suffering in Q3 only $236 million of transactions in sales and $39 million of EBITDA.", "So, that context is making things good. Your point is very good, which is, we haven't gotten very much volume growth, but we have given a guidance for the next three years at having a 4% to 5% growth. And I firmly believe we're going to have that, and it's going to be less on pricing, more on volume.", "And yes, mix is helping, thanks to our innovation products. Every single division is extremely excited about all of this. You should have gone, I don't know if you have, but you should have gone to PACK EXPO for where we were having a huge booth, which was packed like no tomorrow, in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. You should have gone to the ISSA, where we got lots of awards for our innovation, et cetera.", "And you should, and Karl, maybe you might want to make some comments with regards to our innovation on our best new products, which are making pretty good inroads in Europe in the thing. So, yes, more volume in 2016, and a little bit of (44:45) less price. But if we have had 3% or if we're under \u2013 about 3% growth year-to-date or so, I have really zero problem with the 4% to 5% over the mid-term.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Yeah. Absolutely, Jerome (44:59). So, just a few quick comments. Obviously, if you back out Brazil and Venezuela, we're growing 2% to 3%. We had 3.1% organic growth. And basically, around the world, we're excited with the introduction of a variety of new products. We're showing significant above-market growth in Europe, especially Western Europe, heavily being driven by introduction of things like our Darfresh on Tray, as I mentioned, some of our new solutions in the ready meals market.", "And so, those, coupled with some of the adjacent markets we've had, starting to gain traction and acceptance of our new aseptic technologies with the sale of a couple of new systems in three different regions of the world; so, a lot of positive things going on in light of all the negative economic impacts as well.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our e-commerce business is going to be very nicely growing. We're a package \u2013 a protective packaging supplier. And we're moving, thanks to the B+ acquisition and our new flow wrap equipments, we are moving now into a solutions provider, which allows us to help our customers to improve the pace at packaging. And that is what is of tremendous value.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, Jerome, Carol, Lori. Just following up on that discussion around the longer-term guidance and the shift towards volume growth from price/mix, year-to-date price-cost mix is about $144 million, and the longer-term guidance is for about $150 million. Just, does that combine with Carol's commentary? It sounded as if there was maybe some slowdown in growth coming in Food Care. As we walk into 2016, especially in the first half, I mean, is it going to be hard to put up any significant EBITDA expansion in the first half of 2016 if volumes are a little bit weak and price cost starts to slow a little bit?", "And then, Carol, one follow-up on the $55 million of working capital. How much of that is coming from the impact of lower resin prices? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, in terms of \u2013 I don't know Karl, do you want to talk about the Food Care and just remind everybody the outlook for 2016 that the growth is really coming later in 2016?", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Yeah. I mean, obviously, we have some tough comps, and we have FX continuing to impact in some vagaries in the markets of when certain markets may drop off and other markets may strengthen. But overall, in 2016, we're very positive that we'll provide solid top-line performance with leverage to the bottom line to escalate the EBITDA as well. I mean, we have a lot of very positive things going on in each region, and you can just look at some of the regions where we are getting some positive increase in the animal numbers or significant penetrations in the market. We're getting very nice growth. We're getting very nice growth in a very mature market like the UK, and we're getting significant penetration growth, near doubling of the business in countries like Russia.", "So, I think while we manage some of the downturns, we have a lot of exciting things going on in a variety of mature markets, as well as emerging markets as well. We'll just see kind of a transition of where that business is, with Australia potentially dropping off sooner than North America escalating, we just work through those in the first half. But long term, there's a lot to be excited about around the world.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, I guess, the question was really towards the short term. And the question is on the timing on Australia coming down and the pickup of the other countries and how bad is Brazil going to get. And so, we're not negative. There are cycles. The beef cycle in Australia is showing its trend down. September was showing the strong decline in beef production. But we've been \u2013 it's been about a double-digit decline in beef production and we had been \u2013 we had growth. And in Brazil, we don't believe that it's going to go further down. We want to be careful because things are fairly unstable overall in the world, in emerging countries, et cetera.", "Having said that, I'm not pessimistic, whatsoever. And if we're talking about a quarter versus another one, that's one thing. But look at what we have delivered in the third quarter in fairly adverse conditions at this point in time. And look at what we're delivering in the year despite \u2013 so we're delivering EBITDA growth despite the overall situation, which is pretty difficult altogether in the global market. So, I'm not negative whatsoever into what's going on right now.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes. And good morning, everyone. First of all, just \u2013 could you just confirm that the European trays business, was in \u2013 that was in Food Care, is that right?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's correct.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And I guess the key question I had is, just thinking about your comments about the inventory situation. If I look at the free cash flow guide, it's down $25 million, and if you sort of think of the net CapEx depreciation change, that's about $10 million, as well as restructuring is another $10 million. So, add all that up and it's a $45 million swing. Is that about the degree to which inventories are going to be higher? And then as a follow-up to that, is this something that's more transitory, or is this sort of a new permanent level that you think inventories need to remain at?", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, Chip, it's largely \u2013 and your math is approximately, it's correct. Because what we had guided to in the $585 million of free cash flow was somewhere $100 million to $110 million positive impact from working capital and other assets, other liabilities. And we're now saying, just the math would tell you that amount is approximately $55 million in total. We don't think that we have to maintain higher inventories as a percent of sale on a permanent go-forward basis, but we do think as we move into Q4, it's prudent for us to have a higher level to be able to support our customers at the right service level they've come to expect for on-time delivery.", "In addition to that, some of our restructuring costs is to support addressing the supply chain footprint. The Senior Vice President for Supply Chain, Emile Chammas, and his team, are very focused on making sure we have proper alignment of where we produce, where we have our distribution centers, and how they support the organization. And there are some moving parts in there that are part of that restructuring. So, we also take that into consideration when we think about the inventory levels that will help us have the business operate at the optimal level through Q4 and into the first quarter of 2016. I also will take this opportunity to remind everyone that our 2018 free cash flow guidance is $775 million as we shared at Analyst Day, and we feel very good about that. It's a great healthy number and we're committed to be able to deliver.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. Jerome or Karl, I was wondering if you could comment on recent articles saying that red meat and processed food are creating health hazard, cancer in particular and what kind of an impact this could have on your operations and whether you have had discussions already with customers, and can you help us understand what this could do if it has an impact on the marketplace.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Okay.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Karl will answer. But welcome to the club of carcinogenic products. This is one more out of 478 carcinogenic food items.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Yeah.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is no way we're going to be able to eat anything pretty soon. Anyway, go ahead.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "So basically, Rosemarie, it's very simple. Obviously, we're involved in a number of trade organizations that support the fresh meat and smoked and processed meat industries and they've had their pulse on this for a while. There is no doubt that with the growing middle class as well as the expanding global population, the demand for proteins is going to increase, and we're sure seeing that in the market.", "It'll take a while. This report was just released yesterday for all the dust to settle. I'm sure it'll gain a lot of media attention for a short period of time. But I don't think there's anything in it that is new, but obviously we support the industries we serve. And there's no doubt that we continue to help our customers provide safe, wholesome products to the market.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mark.", "Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Mark.", "Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Carol, I wondered if you could just help us with kind of the puts and takes on the food packaging business, particularly in places like Brazil, like Argentina, like Australia, when we get these big currency moves? Because logically, you'd expect that the weaker reals would start to push up meat exports out of Brazil. And as I've always understood it, you make it more on the packaging that goes into the export markets, rather than the domestic market? And then as a follow-on, I wondered if you could just also comment on the signs that some of your competitors in the meat packaging business are expanding capacity here in North America?", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Sure, Mark. Let me take the first one first. And it would be intuitive that with the drop of the real, the export market should be increasing. However, there are multiple inputs on those type of issues. And Brazil's primary export customers are Russia, Venezuela, China; all of which have depressed buying due to their social economic issues, as well as Russia becoming more focused on self-manufacture. In addition, Russia has also banned imports from 10 different Brazilian plants. So, a lot of that is politically driven, but it still is what it is. And \u2013 so, those have truncated export sales. What Brazil continues to do is look at developing an export market to North America, to Asia, all of those support long-term trends for them. In regards \u2013 I can't really comment on our competitors' adding capacity. We obviously believe we have proprietary position, proprietary products, and continue to look at evolving our business as well.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, your point, too, is very strong, is very good with regards to Brazil. It takes a little bit of time to create and to make ways for new markets. But I was referring exactly to that when I said that I think that the Brazilian market has bottomed. And yes, we do have more value-add in our product for exports than for the local domestic markets, which tends to be frozen.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "Especially when they go from frozen to fresh...", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly right.", "Karl R. Deily - President of Food Care", "...it's very, very impactful.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, I think we have time for one or two more questions, possibly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. In your Protective business \u2013 or I'm sorry, Product Care business, you saw a deceleration of volumes. Was that mostly due to the industrial economy slowing that you called out, or is that \u2013 and as you lap the product pruning next year, do you expect volumes to actually grow next year? And how much of a lift should we expect price/mix as well as you kind of make inroads for some of your new products? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So \u2013 exactly right, Jeff (sic) [Phil]. This is the \u2013 Phil, this is the right analysis. We are now looking very deep and organized by business sectors. And general manufacturing has gone down in the mid- to high-single-digits because of softening of exports and a dramatic slowdown in the oil and gas market where we have some specialty products there. And for your information, we pack valves, pumps and fittings in that sector, and that has gone seriously down.", "The second sector which has suffered is the electronics market. You have noted that there are less \u2013 negative sales growth in tablets, in laptops, in desktops. That has affected our market also and a little bit in the transportation sector, transportation for us being aviation and automobiles. The spare parts markets, specifically for exports, has been going slightly down. All of those negative trends have been compensated by a very strong e-commerce business where we have very, very good value-add solutions.", "China is up, and it is not up because of industrial GDP, which is fairly muted, but it is up because of our solutions. And we're focused on value-add type of products there. We have had this negative growth as a result of heavy rationalization in Latin America and a little bit in North America also. Europe is doing okay and we are expecting definitely volume growth into next year.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, we'll take our last question, please?", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please proceed.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, everyone. Just back to next year for a second. Can you give us some sense of whether you expect volume, price/mix or cost savings to contribute the bulk of your EBITDA growth next year and why?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we'll talk a lot about that when we give our guidance in early February. So, I'd rather stay focused in this discussion with regards to this year and the rest of the year. But unless you want to add something, Carol \u2013 but she's telling me no. So, very frankly, we are \u2013 we're not done with what we want to achieve in terms of quality of our business with our existing portfolio. We have clearly segregated this business into commodities and specialties in every single of the divisions.", "It's not that I don't like commodities, because you can make very nice money with commodities, provided you have best-in-class manufacturing costs, which was not the case in trays, by the way; and provided your investments and your cost to serve is highly competitive. When they're not, when you don't have those two conditions, you need to be very careful because you are going to spend a disproportionate amount of time on those commodities compared to serving the markets with our specialty products or specialty solutions.

And it really is now doing extremely well.", "So, all in all, I want to thank you all. This has been what I call a very strong quarter. This is an outstanding year for us. And remember where we started, we had a guidance originally on EPS at $2.18, if I remember well. We have now an estimate at $2.32, including $0.36 of negative currency. I just call that fabulous. We are improving our EBITDA despite year-to-date $96 million of negative EBITDA compared to last year. I just call that extraordinary.", "And we are doing this because we're very firmly believing that we have room to grow, that there is time for being very firm on our strategy with regards to Get Fit. And we are making great progress, for those of you who were in our Investor Day in June, you have seen what we have in our Change the Game.

Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter One 2016 Sealed Air Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sue and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our performance and what we expect going forward.", "Our first quarter results overall were essentially in line with our expectations. Remember, I told you early February that our first quarter 2016 would be our toughest year-on-year comparable due to currency headwinds, the impact from divestitures and formula pricing in Food Care. This was why we set our first quarter 2016 guidance for sales at $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $245 million with $18 million of currency headwind and $14 million impact from divestitures, and this is about what we have delivered.", "The Food Care pricing formulas, which were highly favorable in the first quarter last year, turned unfavorable as predicted. And if there was a surprise, it was lying in the steepness in Venezuela's and Brazil's Food Care volume decline and its related impact on profitability. Having said that, Food Care delivered 4% volume growth in North America, and 3% volume growth in EMEA on an organic basis. Diversey Care increased volume over 4% in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. And Product Care volume was up 6% in EMEA and essentially flat in North America, even with our rationalization efforts and ongoing softness in the industrial sector.", "So, we're seeing nice volume growth in targeted regions and for the second consecutive quarter, we have seen robust equipment installment. In the first quarter, equipment sales increased more than 10% in constant dollars and all three divisions had positive growth. Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to solid results in our Product Care division, which increased margins 90% basis points (sic) [90 basis points] (04:22) as compared to last year. We also recognized incremental savings from restructuring and demonstrated corporate expense control.", "I also told you in February that our performance would improve sequentially throughout the year with an acceleration of growth in the second half. We also said more of our growth would come from volume versus price mix, and I do confirm that this remains our outlook for each of our three businesses, and we are confident in our guidance for the full year.", "Looking ahead for Food Care, further global adoption of our innovative solutions, coupled with a well-anticipated up cycle in the North American beef market, along with improving trends in other regions will drive profitable and accelerated growth for the remainder of the year and several years to come. Diversey Care and Product Care have tremendous momentum, thanks to the execution on our Change the Game strategy as does our medical business. And as I mentioned, we have had favorable equipment trends, which is an indication, a strong indication of what's to come.", "And before we get into the details of our results, I want to highlight that for the first time since 2010, we announced that the board of directors approved an increase on our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased by 23% from $0.13 to $0.16. We also repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our stock valued at $32 million in the first quarter and still have $852 million remaining under our share repurchase program.", "Karl Deily, President of our Food Care Division, is joining us today on our call, along with Carol Lowe, our CFO. So with that, let me pass the call to Carol and Karl, and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Jerome. On slide four of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA where we had 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our three divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%, Product Care increased 6%, and Diversey Care increased 1%.", "On a by country basis, EMEA was led by positive sales trends in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Poland and Russia. Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars led by 7% constant dollar sales growth in Diversey Care. Sales in China increased in both Diversey Care and Food Care. India delivered double-digit growth in Diversey Care. Australia and New Zealand combined account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. In Food Care, Australia was essentially unchanged despite slaughter declines of approximately 17%, as cattle farmers initiated rebuilding of their herd. New Zealand was down 6% due to the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market.", "Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 19%, which translates into 9% growth in constant dollars. We were pleased to see volume growth in Diversey Care, which was attributable to recent customer wins in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Also, if you exclude Venezuela and Brazil from Food Care results, volume in Latin America would be up 2.5% with strong growth in Mexico and Argentina.", "Let's move to slide five and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America was down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price mix offsetting positive volume trends. Food Care's 4% volume growth was offset by formula pricing. As Jerome mentioned, Product Care's volumes were up slightly, but this was offset by unfavorable price mix. As we move through the year, we anticipate volume growth to accelerate for both Food Care and Product Care with customer acceptance of our new portfolios and stronger end market demand.", "Diversey Care delivered positive price mix, but it was offset by lower volumes into the distribution channel. Our ERP implementation has gone well; however, there was some timing impact on the quarter. April sales for Diversey Care have been strong and we expect this growth to continue for the remainder of the year.", "Turning to slide six, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.6 billion in sales, a decrease of 9% on an as-reported basis and up 1.5% on an organic basis. Volume contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable price mix contributed $10 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $113 million, and the impact from divestitures was $67 million.", "Adjusted EBITDA was $243 million or 15.3% of net sales. Unfavorable currency translation was $18 million, and the impact from divestitures was $14 million. Operating expenses increased $30 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $16 million and inventory capitalized variances were $12 million. These expenses were partially offset by $14 million in restructuring savings and $5 million from higher volume. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 in the first quarter.", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21% compared to 25% last year, primarily due to our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner and a more favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Karl to go through our results by division. Karl?", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "Thank you, Carol.", "Let's turn to slide seven and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price mix. By region, EMEA increased 5%, while North America declined 1%. Latin America was up 10% in constant dollars and Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged. Our adjusted EBITDA was $148 million or 19.3% of net sales. This compares to 21.7% last year and 18.7% last quarter.", "If you recall, this time last year, excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, we experienced a significant positive price cost spread due to positive formula pricing and lower input costs. This year, our first quarter results reflect a tough comparable on formulas, the negative impact from Venezuela and Brazil, and the expected slowdown in the Australia and New Zealand business. As Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars on both the top and bottom line in the second quarter and accelerated growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to forecast organic growth in sales and EBITDA with margin expansion.", "I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace that gives us the confidence in our future performance. First, on a global basis, we continue to see customer adoption and further market penetration across all protein sectors in our case-ready platforms. Darfresh on Tray and ready meals continue to gain significant momentum around the world. Second, we are experiencing rapid expansion of our fluid-based solutions, including our vertical pouch packaging, or VPP systems, as well as our aseptic offerings. And third, our customer trials across the globe for our new barrier technology, OptiDure, are going very well.", "As for our hygiene business, we are experiencing continued growth with our direct food contact solutions for food safety and our knowledge based-services to optimize water and energy usage.", "We also are beginning to see positive impact of the larger herd size in North America, which is resulting in steady increase in cattle coming to market. In Europe, where the protein market is relatively stable, we are experiencing organic sales growth as a result of new product acceptance in Western Europe and increased market penetration in Eastern Europe. We look forward to capitalizing on improving end market demand in both North America and Europe, but keep in mind, our growth in 2016 will be partially offset by a continued slowdown in Australia/New Zealand and the economic conditions in both Brazil and Venezuela.", "So, if we go to slide eight, we'll highlight the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up just over 1% in the first quarter. We had favorable price mix in every region and 4% to 5% volume growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million was 8.2% of net sales. As a reminder, first quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter and we continue to expect constant dollar sales growth as well as margin expansion for the full year. Also keep in mind, we have continued to invest in disruptive technologies, including specific investments in robotics. We are winning new strategic customers and we have already started servicing those customers this quarter in facility management and food service industries.", "Our focus on sustainability, productivity and integration of chemicals, tools and machinery is being recognized throughout the industry. This quarter, from a vertical market perspective, sales increased in food service, retail and in hospitality. We have gained traction with our advanced floor care solutions with the installation of IntelliTrail, the advanced GPS tracking system, on more than 1,100 TASKI machines, and we see rapidly growing demand for our Intellibot portfolio.", "Now, let's turn to our Product Care results on slide nine. Product Care's net sales were essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, with volume growth offset by unfavorable price mix. You may recall that we divested a $15 million product line in North America in January, yet we held volumes relatively flat as compared to last year. This is attributable to our strong position in e-commerce and third-party logistics or the fulfillment market where we continue to experience double-digit growth. We also have been able to maintain good pricing disciplines despite lower input costs, as our customers recognize the value-add of our new and innovative solutions, combined with our global reach and broad product portfolio.", "I also want to highlight our business in Europe, where we delivered 6% volume growth in light of ongoing rationalization efforts. Our performance was attributable to the successful integration of our B+ acquisition and the traction we've gained with our automated solutions, including the B+ portfolio, FloWrap, inflatable Bubble and Sealed Air. In the second quarter, we will divest a $12 million product line in Europe, which should complete our product rationalization efforts. For the year, we anticipate top line growth and margin expansion with a stronger second half of the year, given our success in the fulfillment market.", "Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Karl.", "Turning to slide 10, free cash flow was a use of cash of $48 million in the first quarter. CapEx increased to $52 million as compared to $21 million during the same period a year ago, of which, $15 million was related to our Charlotte campus.", "Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $141 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales, based on a 13-month average, is relatively the same since year-end at 14.5%. As compared to a year ago, we improved 106 basis points. We believe there is still opportunity to further improve payables and inventory management, even though we have reached our long-term target of 15%. For the full year, we continue to expect working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.", "Turning to slide 11, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2016. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacted the first quarter. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016's EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacted the first quarter. We expect our second quarter results to be down on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to formula pricing in Food Care. However, as Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in every quarter going forward.", "Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation digital technologies. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within the range that we previously provided of $2.52 to $2.60. At this point in time, we are not updating our outlook on currency translation. As you know, markets have been extremely volatile and we are focusing on what we can control.", "We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be $150 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $110 million and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million.", "In closing, I would like to once again note that we are confident we are investing in the right markets and in the right region that will enable us to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We are not ignoring the global environment. We have and we will continue to advance continuous improvements and realize further operational efficiency. With our most challenging quarter now behind us, we look forward to delivering improved performance for the balance of the year and in the years ahead.", "Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 28. We have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey care to join Jerome and me for the Q2 call.", "Operator, can you please now open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. So, thinking back to your guidance in February, organic growth of 3.5% for 2016 is what you originally assumed. Just given the start to the year at 1.5%, how should be think about that core growth expectation for the year? Particularly, Jerome, since a lot of the issues you cited, including Food Care weakness in Latin America, and also the Middle East impact on Diversey likely to have some longevity? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good question, Ghansham. We need to go back to what we have guided towards and you'll remember that it is the first time we gave the guidance for a specific quarter. And we did that because we knew what was happening from the pricing coming negative and growth being somewhat muted at the beginning of the year, the divestiture and the currency headwinds. So as far as I'm concerned, really no surprise. The only surprise has been coming from how steep Latin America Food Care has been with 6% volume declines. But this is very specific. It's been very specific as a result of Venezuela which has melted down and as Brazil, which has had \u2013 and Karl will add a little bit in that, which has seen very, very steep local meat consumption reduction and very high prices of meat. And next to that in Latin America, by the way, our Diversey Care business has been very strong, specifically in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and so on.", "So we prepared and we said all of that early February, and we are exactly where we said we would be in the end. With regards to the rest of the year, we are going to be talking specifically about the three divisions, but you need to remember that in Product Care to start with, we \u2013 because of the strength and the growth that we have in third-party logistics and e-commerce, we are going to now have \u2013 this division have its very specific seasonality towards Q4. And we are extremely optimistic, thanks to our equipment placement and our customer wins, that we are going to have sequentially, very nice quarters of growth there.", "With regard to Diversey Care, we have had some very specific one-offs in North America as a result of channel sales being a little bit muted and ERP implementation consequences as happens to every single company when they go through that experience. But we are verifying and very pleased with what's going on in North America, specifically happy with what's going on in Asia Pacific with renewed nice growth in China for example, strong in India as always, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, we're pleased with what we're seeing.", "In Food Care, I will let Karl speak more specifically about it, but we've got some tailwind coming from the beef cycle. We've got proteins in general doing quite well and we've got very nice innovation. All of this makes me confirm that you are going to see, as I said, already late last year and early this year, we're going to have nice growth \u2013 renewing with nice growth and that this growth is going to be more on volume than it is going to be on price as a result of the resin prices.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Karl?", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Karl, some comments on Food Care?", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "Yeah. Just real briefly, I mean, there's no doubt that Venezuela being down almost 59%, Brazil being down 8.5% are ongoing issues. We do see Brazil though not improving immediately, but there is medium to long-term positive trends in Brazil. I mean obviously, the Brazilian animal prices are still at a relatively all-time high. We do see retail prices dropping due to the lack of demand, but we also see their export market having favorable trends occurring. If you remember, one of the reasons Brazil export market was down is they were predominantly exporting to Venezuela and Russia, which had their own unique economic issues, but they've gained access, although, there's some small work yet left to do to gain access to U.S. as an export market.", "They're gaining significant business in China as an export market and parts of Asia, somewhat to fill the void left by Australia slaughter being down. So we do believe it's a mid to long-term positive in Brazil. We're also very favorable in the rest of our emerging markets where we have around 5% volume growth. And then we're still very, very positive on our volume growth in North America, 4% and Europe up 3% where we basically have a strategy of growing geographically as well as growing in the mature markets through innovation. So we're still seeing both of those going through.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Carol, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned around the $30 million of higher operating expenses in the quarter. I think you said $16 million of higher wages and salaries; $12 million of \u2013 I couldn't hear it \u2013 capitalized inventory, which doesn't seem to really match up with the $20 million of supply chain and $10 million of SG&A, can you just walk us through that $30 million bucket in more detail, because there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding there? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Okay. Yes. Thank you, Scott, and good morning. So the salary inflation of $16 million that I referenced, that covers both for SG&A as well as our supply chain costs of goods sold component. So, for SG&A we had about $7 million in salary wage inflation and cost of goods sold, the salary wage inflation is approximately $9 million and that gets you to the $16 million.", "If we look at the $12 million that I referenced on inventory variances, that is largely due to timing relative to capitalized variances that we amortize over our inventory turns and varies from quarter to quarter, year to year, depending on inventory levels, what's capitalized, purchase price variances, efficiencies in the factories. But again, it's largely timing. So again, the two major components are typical compensation inflation that we have every year as well as the inventory variances, of which most is capitalized and then amortized.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the color so far. Maybe if I could just piggyback on Scott's question, Carol, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of what causes the actual inventory variances of $12 million? Just some broad strokes there. And then, Karl, just a quick one for you, what gives you confidence that the cattle cycle will continue to move higher? Because obviously things like weather, feed costs, price of protein, can derail that over time. Thank you.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Okay. So George, without getting into a lot of detail, on the inventory variances when we reset standards periodically, we have internal guidelines that we follow in terms of when we have changes from our standards by more than a certain percentage, typically using a 10% rule of thumb. That can be impacted within a region or country based on the amount of imports that we're doing. Are they impacted by purchase price variances? Are they impacted by FX transaction costs, which are different than translation costs, as well as the operational efficiencies that impact our indirect supply chain costs, our fixed and administrative costs for running our factories and our warehouses and logistics networks?", "So, it's a combination of all of those as we bring them together and looking at the change for inventory values and properly capitalizing the amount, so it's reflected in our inventory turns as we move forward. And on a year-over-year basis, obviously that can be very different depending on where we end one quarter from an inventory level standpoint and efficiencies within that quarter versus comparison to the following year. Karl?", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "Okay. George, and thank you for the question, and I'll try to be very brief, but specific. We do have a lot of confidence that the cattle cycle and the herd is continuing to be rebuilt and that additional animals are currently going to market. You are absolutely right. Weather, feed cost, currency, all have an impact; and drought, as it impacts pasture conditions, can significantly have an impact. But corn projections, although up slightly, are still very favorable. The amount of very good pasture conditions are still at a high level.", "So currency is still maybe impact some on export, but still the fundamentals are there. The producers are making money. The cow-calf operations are making money and they're still retaining heifers. We don't have a balance of steers and heifers coming to market yet. When you see that, that'll be an indication that they've built the herd as large as they're going to build it. So, we do see them continuing to build the herd. If you go back to what we said at Investor's Day as a baseline, we're right on target. We believe that the herd will continue to be built and that additional animals will come to market over the next three years at a minimum.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess I had a couple of questions on the supply chain costs. I guess would you characterize these as one-time in nature? And what is your outlook for these coming back over the next year or two? And then I guess the other question I had was resin costs, looks like they are going up in Q2. What's your outlook on passing those through? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So of the supply chain costs, there is about $4 million that is a one-time negative we wouldn't see going forward. The other is really based around efficiency, purchase price variances, and that will change quarter-to-quarter depending on how we're operating and demand and performance and again, it's amortized and a lot is driven by where we end with inventory balances of one quarter and how we progress through the next. And because of our global footprint and the impact of currency and everything, it can \u2013 the quarter. It is a timing thing, and usually because our inventory turns about four times within a year, it typically smoothes out over the balance of the full year.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "With regard to resins, yes, we have had in North America resin cost increases. The formula pricings are the formula pricings. We have contracts with our customers based on those, specifically in Food Care, a little bit, not very much in Product Care. And when it is not formula pricing it is a negotiation. So we have seen March increase and April increase. There might be some in May, not necessarily; we'll have to see how this goes. And therefore, we are negotiating on those cost increases with customers every time we can. You know that we've been very sensitive to pricing and we're not in the job of absorbing those things. So that's what we are working on. Now those comes on the heels of some price decreases and therefore we have to be cognizant of all of this. Having said that, we're having actions in that. What do we expect for the rest of the year? We don't think that the volume and the momentum is going to go for additional resin increases at that point in time.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol, just a couple of quick ones. On the EBITDA commentary you provided, I believe you said 2Q would be down from a year ago. Can you give us some order of magnitude compared to last year's $308 million? And then just my other question is in terms of the disclosure of the FX drags and organic growth for the company, as a whole, obviously you had been providing that last quarter. You've stopped doing so. Can you give us a reason why? Thank you very much.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Okay. Thank you, Adam. With respect to the year-over-year decline that we expect for Q2, although expecting growth from Q1 through Q2, it's not very significant, but we want to stay away from giving the quarterly guidance. It was more significant for Q1 and that's why we called it out. I think the focus should be on where our full year guidance is at that we've provided. And with respect to the currency, as I noted, it's very volatile. And we just feel like at this point, some of the upside that we've seen now with the euro, if we look at Latin American currencies as well as the Australian dollar and Canada, they are largely offsetting a lot of the favorability that we're seeing with the euro. So, we'll get into where we're updating this quarter-to-quarter and honestly, we just don't have that much visibility to it.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Having said that, we told you in February \u2013 early February that we are expecting $18 million of negative currency compared to last year and despite a lot of second guessing by lots of people, we have had $17.8 million, so close enough.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you and your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde, of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Is it possible, Karl, for you to give us some sense on sort of a normalized basis about how important Brazil and Venezuela are in your overall Latin American food business? And then also in the Australia/New Zealand commentary, it sounded like maybe that was a little bit weaker in the first quarter than you were anticipating. Can you give us a little color on that, and what you expect for the balance of the year?", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "Yes. And I'll start, Mark, with Australia/New Zealand first. We saw Australia where their slaughter rates are down, Carol said, 17%. Our sales are relatively flat in that area, so we've also had some depression in the dairy market in New Zealand, so we have two key markets for us that the market conditions are unfavorable, but yet we've kept relatively flat volumes and we did that with diversification, new product innovation, disruptive innovations that have allowed us to grow in a down market.", "We would anticipate that the Australian beef market will stay relatively negative for at least two years because they're just starting their herd rebuilding cycle, but they are rebuilding the herd. So again, mid to long-term, we're still very favorable in that segment of the market. So that's some color in Australia/New Zealand.", "In Brazil, obviously Brazil is an important part of our long-range strategy and we think fundamentally with the infrastructure they have in producing food, whether it's poultry, beef and a growing amount pork, that we're well-positioned to capitalize on as those markets recover. We're still heavily entrenched in the key customers in that region and continue to provide automation, new product introductions as well to position ourselves for when their volumes return. Venezuela is the more longer-time concern, and again, they're a nice part of Latin America, but much smaller on the grand scheme of things. So we have great confidence in our total Latin America business where we're still seeing volume growth, minus the two areas of concern, and we believe that Brazil will be tough in the second quarter, but we believe that there is some opportunity to start turning positive in the second half and definitely going forward.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, you see, Venezuela is Venezuela, we all know what's going on. We also know what's going on in Brazil, but the situation is extremely different. What you have is the perfect storm in Brazil. You have had high meat prices, and you read the newspaper like me and therefore, you have had socioeconomical difficulties there and as you combine very high red meat prices and the situation I just talked about, you have had in the first quarter the highest meat consumption decrease that you ever had since statistics have existed in Brazil. So that's what I would call a temporary factor, because at the very same time, you didn't have very much exports, but exports from Brazil meat are going to be improving. And therefore, as the year passes, we believe that situation is going to be improving, both from the meat prices, cattle herd prices, and from the economic situation as there are political anxieties.", "So if you exclude Brazil and Venezuela, which it is what it is, you would have seen that we would have solid volume growth in the rest of Latin America, which is very encouraging. So, we're not throwing the baby with the bathwater. We've been very specifically hit in this first quarter. It's not going to be a quick recovery, but the cattle herd is going to be rebuilding in Brazil also and you're going to have some positive effects from Argentina over time as the new government, the Macri government, is going to enable exports. They have started to do this at small levels, but they are going to liberalize meat exports. So, I think all of this is positive.", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "Yeah, Mark, they're about 4% of our total Food Care, total Brazil.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. In Product Care, you pointed to I think flattish volumes in North America, despite some of the rationalization activities and weakness in the industrial sector. I was wondering, is it possible to size what the impact of the rationalization was on volumes in the quarter, or what volumes would have been, ex-those activities? And then just the industrial weakness in Product Care, is that something that has gotten maybe better through the three months of the quarter and into April, or gotten worse? Or any kind of color you can give on industrial end-market trends would be helpful.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, on this rationalization, we told you in the first quarter that this was a $15 million rationalization. And therefore, you have it there. So therefore, as you look at our Product Care total business, you're seeing that despite of that we had about flattish sales so we've got \u2013 why don't you take that we've got about $15 million growth in there. The price mix has been a little bit negative, but altogether, we are seeing a lot of momentum. I told you that last year already and that we were going to have it, and we're having it.", "We are seeing a lot of interest around the four pillars of fulfillment, velocity, consumer experience, damage control, et cetera, a lot of momentum with customers who are seeing us as creating a lot of value to them through our knowledge-based approach. And when you look at all of this, the cost of the packaging versus the influence it can have on damage and on all the factors and freight reduction because of (47:45), et cetera, because the packaging is really irrelevant. And that's why we're having so much traction helping our customers improve their own situation and create new value out of that.", "And just to finish, I have been very positive about the transformation, which has been ongoing in that division, like in all the others by the way. And you are, because it is a faster business than the Diversey Care business, which tends to have long-term contracts, and the Food Care businesses, which tends to have a long cycle for approval of new packaging, it is the kind of business where you're going to be seeing, over time, the quickest improvement.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Jerome. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Phillip Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. If I heard you guys correctly, you are guiding EBITDA down year-over-year in 2Q, which implies guidance is very back-end loaded. That's about a $50 million shortfall you've got to make up in the back half. Outside of volumes, what's driving the improvement? Are you essentially assuming mid single-digit organic growth in the back half and perhaps price costs looking a little better? Thanks.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, good morning, Phil. It is \u2013 yes, and we acknowledged when we gave guidance back in February that the year was going to largely be driven by performance in the second half. We do have the seasonality that we've noted that's increasing relative to our Product Care business with the e-commerce business and how that drives the whole fulfillment chain. Also, the second half relative to the North America beef cycle and improvements in protein growth overall on a global basis. So it's as we expected, and we're confident with that full year guidance even knowing that most of it's going to happen in the second half of the year.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And our innovation is kicking in. You remember what we told you during our Investor Day in June of last year; we told you that it was we had solid programs and since then from time-to-time I have updated you on a few very key programs which are continue to go better than what we originally told you they would. So we're not going to update you on our Change the Game programs every year and in an Investor Day, but we're going \u2013 during investor meetings, et cetera, we're going to share the progress we're making. We have some really nice things going on right now.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, Next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.", "Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes. And good morning. Just a two-part question quickly, a small one is, I noticed you called out supply chain and SG&A in the year-over-year bridges for EBITDA in two of the segments, but you did not in Product Care, and I just didn't know if there was a reason why that wouldn't apply. And then secondly, I know I think you said originally the FX guidance, I know you're not updating it, was $400 million on the top line for the year, and we're a little bit more than a fourth of the way of that number in the first quarter, but it would seem to me if you froze things today that number in the second quarter would probably be half, and therefore we're probably running at a pace so far that $400 million would not be achieved unless we were to see the dollar reverse and start to rise again. So, your comments on those two points would be appreciated.", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. So Chip, with respect to the question about Product Care and the difference. If you look at the operating expenses, called out on the EBITDA bridge, it was a year-over-year change of $1 million. The difference between the SG&A and the supply chain is very insignificant, so that's the reason we didn't call it out and Product Care wasn't as impacted on the inventory cap variances as Diversey Care and Food Care. And then on the FX, I think we've commented to the extent that we're going to comment on that.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jerome, I was wondering if we look at Product Care and the difference between North America and EMEA if you could talk about the markets served, as I would have expected North America to do better than EMEA given the respective economies.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, well, it's true that the U.S. economy, North American economy, is doing better than the European one, but what we're seeing is that there's been quite a few muted investments in quite a few sectors in Europe, and as a result of that, even when the economy just only increases a few decimal points, it is the relativity of the improvements which is important to consider here. What you also have to know is that Europeans tend to automate more their e-Commerce operations than the U.S. has done so far, and the packaging in e-Commerce in Europe is tending to be more sophisticated than the one in the U.S., and this is why we are extremely successful there, and we expect to continue being so.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator, I believe we have one or two more questions in the queue, so let's go ahead and squeeze them in if possible. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Just if I could clarify two things; one, Carol, when you referred to earnings being down or flat year-over-year were you referring to EPS or were you referring to EBITDA? That was part one. Part two was I think you talked pretty confidently of the volume getting better as the year progresses, particularly back half of the year, but as you're sitting today, seeing what you have with price mix how are you feeling that component? Could that maybe be negative in 2Q and kind of be flat or only a modest benefit for the year or do you still think that could be 1 point, 1.5 point of benefit?", "Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Chris, in terms of my reference to Q2, that our expectations are for it to be down year-over-year, that is specific to the EBITDA number, not to earnings per share. And with respect to the outlook for the balance of the year on price mix, Jerome, did you want to comment on that? Or even, Karl, I guess because that's where we have the most impact from a formula pricing standpoint for Q2.", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "So, there's no doubt that in the second quarter we're not out of the woods yet. I think, one of the previous questions on resins going up. I think, a lot will be dictated by what the raw material markets do. As Jerome has said, formulas are formulas, and they're going to be a mathematical solution based on the input costs. But so I think the complete color on the second half will be developing in the next month or two months, but obviously, the comparisons get better year-over-year as the year goes on.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, the reason why we're confident in our growth rate for 2016 is once again that we are seeing volume pick up mostly as a result of our innovation and the momentum that we have in the marketplace. The global GDP hasn't moved. Pick your number, 3.2% this year compared to 3.3% or so last year. The IMF reduced the number from 3.4% a few months ago or a quarter ago. That's \u2013 it would be better to have more general economic momentum, but we don't need that given what we have in place. Let me repeat. We have customer wins in Diversey Care as a result of the integration of our equipment, tools and chemicals as a result of our knowledge-based savings introduction and very good, focused work. We're doing that, and by the way, we're seeing this in our pricing. Pricing has been nicely positive this quarter and we expect this to continue.", "Product Care, a lot of momentum. A lot of momentum thanks to the technologies once again, the four pillars and such. In Food Care \u2013 and by the way in Product Care in an industrial GDP environment which is pretty tepid, actually. And in Food Care, we talked to you, it's nicer to have slightly the beginning of an upside in the beef, but we're seeing general protein consumption being positive there, but it is not what is going to create the biggest change in our growth in 2016. What is going to create the biggest change in our growth in 2016 is our innovation.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "I think we have one more question. George Staphos had a follow-up.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks for taking it. Jerome or Carol, could you go into why you had relatively weaker sales into distribution for Diversey? If you mentioned it, I missed it. And then contrast that with what was relatively good performance in Latin America for Diversey despite Food being relatively weak there? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Well, the markets are very different. The regional markets, we were \u2013 we had some good customer momentum in Latin America with some customer wins in Diversey Care and we're happy with the trends and what we're seeing moving better there. With regards to North American Diversey Care, we had a little bit of channel softness as a result of our customers reaching their objectives.", "Remember, and by the way, we talked about this; we were \u2013 as we were doing SAP implementation early in the year, in order to make sure that our customers were going to have no disruption, there's been a little bit of pre-buying and we've talked about that during Q4. There's been a little bit of pre-buying towards the end of the year. Well, we've been paying the price in \u2013 during the first quarter, and then every time you have those kinds of changes in the ERP system you have a little bit of disruption. I will be very transparent. If we were not seeing the growth rate that we have enjoyed you have seen how strong our North American business has been last year in that division, I would just go and signal to you that we're seeing different things. We're going to renew was a very nice strength and growth.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Operator that concludes our call, thank you, everyone, for your questions.", "Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Chantilly and I will be your facilitator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide discussion. This presentation can be found on today\u2019s webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com. I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management\u2019s outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies in this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Included in today\u2019s presentation on Slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome Peribere", "Thank you, Lori and good morning everyone. I am sure that you have the time to review our second quarter earnings results and I will keep my comments brief and then pass the call on to Carol Lowe, our CFO; and Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of our Diversey Care division to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and full year outlook.", "Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations in each of our three divisions. We knew from the onset of the year that our growth in the first half would be muted. Food Care, Diversey Care and Product Care capitalized on growth opportunities in targeted countries and end markets, which offset other areas challenged by economic uncertainties, political unrest and a weak industrial environment. Overall, I am pleased with our adjusted EBITDA results of $306 million or 17.7% of net sales, which includes about $7 million of reimbursement related to environmental expenses on a slight increase in organic net sales.", "Excluding this reimbursement, we had a very solid adjusted EBITDA margin performance of over 17% of sales. Product Care delivered over 21% margin, Food Care over 20%, and for the first time Diversey Care delivered 15% margin, excluding the environmental reimbursements. As we look to the second half and as previously communicated, we expect stronger performance primarily driven by volume acceleration. In Food Care, the operation rate continues to penetrate the market in Europe and we are in successful trials with two large retailers in North America. Diversey Care is enjoying new customer wins across its portfolio and our robotics startup, Intellibot, delivered record sales in May and June. In Product Care, our innovation pipeline and customer inflows are building as we prepare for a seasonally strong year end. This momentum, coupled with an improved protein market and accelerated growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, gives us the confidence in our second half growth trajectory.", "For full year, our outlook is within the range of our previously provided guidance. Currency headwinds are not as high as we anticipated, but this benefit is being offset by our assumptions on resin cost and related impact on Food Care\u2019s formula pricing. Additionally, we anticipate the recent geopolitical events in Europe and the Middle East to have an impact on our business in the coming months.", "Overall, our strategy is clearly working. Our market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of our divisions. In Food Care, customer interest continues to increase for our next generation target technology, Optidur. Diversey Care\u2019s disruptive and innovative technology, including the Internet of Things platform and digitally enabled solutions, are increasing our sales opportunities in a meaningful way. In May, we received a top innovation award at the ISSA/Interclean Trade Show in Amsterdam. And Product Care has reshaped its entire portfolio and go-to-market strategy with dimensional ways, fulfillment velocity and consumer experience solutions. I strongly encourage all of you to attend two upcoming tradeshows: the ISSA/Interclean in late October and Pack Expo in early November, both of which are being held in Chicago. At Pack Expo, Product Care will showcase more commercialized innovation that they ever had in the history of Sealed Air.", "So with that said, let me now pass the call on to Carol and Ilham to get into more details by division and our outlook and then we will answer any questions that you may have. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 5 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the second quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we had 2.5% organic growth and positive sales across our three divisions. Food Care sales increased 3%, Diversey Care increased 1% and Product Care increased 5%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by double-digit growth in Russia and high single-digit growth in Spain and Holland. We also experienced positive sales in Germany and Sweden. Asia-Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars. India was up 12% led by double-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. In China, Diversey Care delivered high single-digit growth and Product Care\u2019s business returned to growth in the quarter. Our largest markets in Asia-Pacific are Australia and New Zealand. And combined, they account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales.", "In Food Care, sales in Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat compared to last year. In Australia, adoption of our advanced product portfolio and new customer wins are helping to offset the double-digit declines in slaughter rate and the export of live animals. In New Zealand, our business continues to be impacted by the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 11%, which translates into constant dollar growth of 8%. Despite the current environment in Latin America, Food Care experienced positive sales growth in Brazil and Mexico on an as-reported basis. This translates into nearly 20% growth in both countries on a constant dollar basis. Brazil and Mexico each accounted for approximately 4% of Food Care sales.", "Let\u2019s move to Slide 6 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America sales were down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price mix of 3% partially offset by 1% volume growth. Food Care delivered healthy volume growth of 3%. This was more than offset by unfavorable formula pass-throughs. Diversey Care\u2019s North America business returned to growth in the second quarter with positive price mix and volume trends. Product Care\u2019s volume and product mix were negatively impacted by the ongoing weakness in the industrial market, particularly in manufacturing and electronics. Volume was also impacted by our rationalization efforts. Excluding rationalization, volume would have been positive in the quarter.", "Turning to Slide 7, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.7 billion. Volume contributed $9 million to top line growth and favorable price mix contributed $7 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $59 million and the impact from divestitures was $15 million.", "On Slide 8, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $306 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $9 million favorable and positive volume contributed $4 million. We had $9 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses of $12 million is net of the $7 million environmental reimbursement Jerome mentioned in his comments earlier. Salary and wage inflation of $17 million, currency was negative $9 million and divestitures were $3 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 29%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Ilham to go through our results by division. Ilham?", "Ilham Kadri", "Thank you, Carol. Slide 9 highlights the results of our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter. We had positive sales growth in constant dollars in all regions. Asia Pacific was our fastest growing region with 7% constant dollar sales growth. In North America and Europe, constant dollar sales were at 3% and 2.4%, respectively. If you look at our adjusted EBITDA excluding the environmental reimbursement, we delivered $80 million or 15% of net sales. Volume, pricing and cost management all contributed to our strong EBITDA performance. It\u2019s worth noting that in the last 2.5 years, with the exception of one quarter, we delivered positive constant dollar sales and adjusted EBITDA growth every quarter.", "I am particularly proud of the performance in North America and Europe over this time period. Remember that when we reorganized this business back in 2013, both Europe and North America had many years of declining sales and deteriorating margins, whereas Middle East, Africa and Latin America increased sales on a constant dollar basis this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our business due to political unrest in the Middle East and economic weakness in Argentina. Middle East, Africa and Latin America combined represents 15% of our sales. Looking ahead, we are confident the momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will continue. We are rolling out new customers and adding to our list of strategic wins across all sectors, including facility management, retail and healthcare sectors.", "Customer feedback on our robotics and Internet of Things platform has been extremely positive and as a result we are accelerating our go-to-market strategy. For the full year, we expect constant dollar adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. The third quarter will experience a decline versus quarter two as we step up our implementation of new sites related to recent customer wins and the significant slowdown in hospitality in Middle East, Africa. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be stronger given the timing of the new customer rollouts and product and regional mix heading into year end.", "Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 10 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 1% on an organic basis driven by a combination of higher volume and favorable price mix. By region, Latin America was up 11% and EMEA increased 3%. Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged and North America declined 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million or 20.3% of net sales. Positive volume in North America and EMEA is largely a result of our case ready platform, including Darfresh on Tray. Also our next-generation barrier technology, Optidure is gaining traction with successful trials in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. In Hygiene, we continued to improve both sales trends and profitability. We are also investing in new solutions, including our recent acquisition of Finland based TTS-Ciptec, a leading, cleaning place systems optimization company. This acquisition complements our expertise in remote monitoring and data analytics and enhances our knowledge based service offering.", "In the second half of the year, Food Care organic sales growth is expected to accelerate, primarily driven by increase in sales volume in North America and Europe. Both regions will benefit from higher protein productions level as well as continued adoption of advanced product. We also believe our packaging business in Brazil is beginning to stabilize with 4% volume growth in the second quarter. These positive trends will be partially offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand and North America formula pricing. On the bottom line, we continue to expect sequential growth in absolute dollars in the third and fourth quarter, resulting in full year organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As Jerome noted, Food Care EBITDA will be negatively impacted by our assumption of raw material costs heading into year end.", "Let\u2019s turn to Product Care results on Slide 11. Product Care\u2019s net sales in constant dollars were down 1.5% due to a 4% decline in North America, partially offset by mid single-digit growth in EMEA. We continued to experience strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment in the first half of the year on a global basis. In North America, this was more than offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial sector. Also keep in mind that we divested $15 million of annualized sales in North America in January and another $12 million of annualized sales in Europe in May. Excluding these guidance figures, global volume trends would have been stronger and we would have delivered a slight uptake in North America.", "In the second half of the year and more so in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, we expect our constant dollar growth rate to accelerate. Demand continues to increase for our Inflatable Bubble, Korrvu, Sealed Air B+ and FloWrap equipment platform. This level of demand is translating into strong double-digit growth in equipment sales and installments. For the full year 2016, top line growth coupled with our focus on pricing and cost discipline will drive constant dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion.", "Now, let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you, Ilham. Turning to Slide 12, free cash flow was a source of cash of $68 million in the first half of the year. CapEx increased to $114 million as compared to $58 million during the same period a year ago, of which $40 million was related to our Charlotte campus. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $165 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year end at 14.3%. As compared to June 30 last year, we improved 130 basis points.", "Now turning to outlook on Slide 13, net sales are expected to be approximately $6.85 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $82 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $275 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $17 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $45 million.", "As Jerome mentioned earlier, we are expecting accelerated EBITDA growth in the second half of the year and anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year. Strength in the fourth quarter will be driven by higher Food Care volumes, our customer rollout schedule in Diversey Care, and seasonal strength in Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $280 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of our previously provided range of $2.52 to $2.60.", "We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be approximately $150 million.", "For the full year, we continue to expect working capital and other assets liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be $110 million and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. As we head into year end, we will focus on what we can control and look for opportunities that will help mitigate the potential impact of the macro environment. We will continue investing to support our future growth opportunities. Our focus on execution and delivering profitable growth is embedded in our winning culture.", "Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27. We have invited Ken Chrisman, President of Product Care to join Jerome and I on that call.", "With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please proceed.", "Scott Gaffner", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Carol Lowe", "Good morning.", "Scott Gaffner", "Hey, Jerome, Carol, Ilham.", "Carol Lowe", "I just wanted to look at the EBITDA guidance. So, it comes down to $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion, looks like down $10 million and yet currency is better. You had a better than expected first half and you are talking about accelerating EBITDA growth in the second half. What is it that\u2019s maybe below expectations for the full year now that\u2019s caused that reduction in the EBITDA guidance?", "Jerome Peribere", "So, let me first say that really counting on the acceleration that I talked about back in February, I said from the very beginning that the first half was going to be re-reviewed and that we were going to see business acceleration. What I also said was that this was going to grow mostly with volume. What I didn\u2019t think was going to happen to the \u2013 was the assumptions that I have \u2013 that we have put on resin prices and they have been lower than what we thought. That is having an impact on our formula pricing. You know how important they are. And we were thinking at the time that those formula pricing in Food Care in North America were mostly going to be in the first half and not in the second half. Well, because of what resin prices are and we anticipate they are going to be, we are going to have negative formula pricing in the second half and that\u2019s basically how we are seeing the situation today. Having said that, our global price mix in Food Care and price mix versus cost price will be positive for the full year, but not as positive as we had originally forecasted. So, that\u2019s basically the slight difference. This is impacting sales growth because of the net sales as a result of the lower resin prices. But what we are doing here is that we are narrowing the range that we are having and that\u2019s mostly what we are doing here. And keep in mind that pricing dropped straight to the bottom line. So, that\u2019s great. The important thing to remember here is the volume trend. And the volume trend is really as per what we were expecting. And why are we seeing good volume trends? It is very clearly the impact of our innovation is kicking in.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please proceed.", "George Staphos", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and discussion. I guess I wanted to ask a two-part question. One, just tying maybe a bow on Scott\u2019s question and then I had a question on volumes relative to case-ready and the new products. So, with EBITDA coming down, your \u2013 relative to your prior guidance and we understand the reasons why, your EPS guidance is towards the higher end of the range. Is there some sort of non-cash driver of that or what reconciles that? And then on Optidur, what\u2019s the risk of cannibalization around existing sales? And with Darfresh on Tray, what\u2019s so positive about that now versus prior case-ready offerings? Thank you, guys.", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay. So, I will answer the third question. The EPS is going to go to Carol. Let me just talk about Optidur and Darfresh on Tray. Optidur, when it is fully launched, which means as it is \u2013 as it will have ramped up, we have cannibalization effects, but it will also have strong margin improvements effect, but this is going to be, call it a full year program. We had several generations of Optidur product. And the first one right here that we are introducing for obvious reasons is mostly new business. And this is at this point in time in Europe we have run trials implants in North America, all extraordinarily successful, between you and me, highly, highly compelling product \u2013 products actually. And therefore, overall, in time, it\u2019s going to be a quarter of sales cannibalization but dramatically improved margin expansion for all kind of reasons that we already have talked about and stuff.", "With regards to Darfresh on Tray, the value selling proposition in several fronts. Number one, you have vacuum skin packaging, which is improving shelf life and this has value for the retailer. It also has value for the producer because of the shipping time, etcetera and it has value for the consumer, because he can keep the product freezer-ready keep the product logger in his fridge, etcetera, etcetera. Then in the production, the equipment runs extremely fast. And also for the production, the producer, you also have no human waste on the top lid because of the way the machine works versus about 20% to 40% waste on the lid. On the EPS, Carol, any comments?", "Carol Lowe", "Yes. George, with EPS, one of the changes is the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization of about $5 million. Also our share count as we are exiting Q2, were at approximately 197 million shares outstanding. We are seeing benefit from share repurchases going into the weighted average calculation from the first quarter where we spent about $32 million to buy almost 700,000 shares back in Q2. We spent approximately $20 million to buy an additional 435 shares back. So, year-to-date, we are at 1.13 million shares with the spend of $52 million. I will remind everyone we still have $832 million available under our July 2015 Board authorization. And managing within our targeted leverage range of 3.5x to 4x, we would expect to return value to shareholders as we consistently messaged as we move forward throughout the year, again maintaining within our leverage.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please proceed.", "Lori Chaitman", "Good morning Ghansham.", "Jerome Peribere", "Hi Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Yes. Good morning guys. I guess sticking on the growth question, can you just give us your view on second half end market growth for your three segments across the various regions, obviously it\u2019s a very complicated backdrop. And then also, how much in total do you think your new growth initiatives will add to that growth rate? Thanks so much.", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay. So I can detail you the \u2013 what the growth initiatives are going to give right away. But as I said, starting with Food Care, our growth is led by innovation. We are in trials with Darfresh on Tray with two large retailers. Things are going extremely well. It takes time to all of this and then to have the full adoption, etcetera, because of all of these requires investments. But \u2013 what I would say if you just go back to our Investor Day of exactly a year ago, it\u2019s all happening and better. When you look at Product Care, and I would let then Ilham comment on Diversey Care, you absolutely need to come to Pack Expo this autumn as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You will see in there as the booth with the highest innovation and that is what is driving our growth. Our e-commerce business is growing extremely well. What is the issue in Product Care, it\u2019s one and simple, is that industrial GDP is not good. Well, if you look at the CAS index, which is truck and rail freight index, it is at the lowest since 2010 right now. So you can\u2019t pretend that the economy, the industrial economy is doing really well because it doesn\u2019t. But when you look at e-commerce and when you look at how we are doing in that environment, actually we clearly are partnering with our customers fulfillment companies 3PLs to join them in the growth they are expecting and in the growth map. We have multiplied by 2.5 the installs of our small equipment in North America. We have done the same, but we have increased by 15% the install of our small equipment in EMEA and almost 30% in Asia. So this tells you that the consumer was going to come during the year. Some comments on Diversey Care, Ilham?", "Ilham Kadri", "Yes. So Ghansham on Diversey Care, I think you have seen the numbers. I am extremely proud of the hard work done by the Diversey Care team and all the important fractions we delivered to report EBITDA. I will give you some colors on regional performance, Europe was extremely strong showing continued momentum since we start transforming this business back in 2013. This was nice growth to raise both markets in South Europe, in Germany. We are winning customers like in the UK where we are rolling out and we will start picking in by the end of the year. In North America, North America returns to growth as we told you in quarter two. Thanks to our healthcare business doing extremely great, with our unique sustainability \u2013 technologies there, as well as we are rolling out the large customers in facility management. We are rolling out as we speak. And we have implemented and kudos to the team help of the 50,000 sites in the report timing and we are tracking ahead of time. And last but the least, in APAC, we have good momentum there as well. We are growing above the industries we serve, with 4% out of the \u201916. Diversey Care coming from volume level, as we told you China is growing high single-digits and India mid double-digitS, just to highlight few leading and strategic economies for our Sealed Air economy.", "Jerome Peribere", "What should made Diversey Care full in the second half is what you and I read in the newspapers, which means that in Diversey Care for example, you have tourism which is strongly impacted in Europe. You have tourism down and some hotel chains have published some results. And you can see that tourism is down in France, tourism down in Belgium, down in Morocco, dramatically down in Turkey, somewhat down in the Middle East. In Egypt, capacity \u2013 hotel capacity utilization is at 55% and is at 50% in Turkey. So you just can\u2019t dream of a perfect world because it\u2019s not. That is going to \u2013 two things are going to impact a little bit Diversey Care in the third quarter and be favorable in the fourth. One is what I just talked about. In the first quarter, remember that tourism is, right now, its big season right now. And the second one is that because of our customer wins, we have a lot, a lot, a lot of installs. And that requires resources, which are being deployed exactly now and we are going to benefit from those sometime next year. And generally speaking, overall on the net sales growth, it is the pricing and the formula pricing of resins which is impacting the dollar sales growth, but definitely not the momentum.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Alright. Thank you. Could you just discuss your outlook on the resin price environment and I guess maybe some of the actions that you take to mitigate volatility that you see there?", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay. So I am not going to go in details, not to signal too much to our competition, but on what we are doing, but we are a large buyer and you should rest assure that we do what it takes to stay very highly competitive. With regards to the resin, actually that\u2019s what I said before. Entering the year, I said in the February call that we were seeing the resin being weak and staying weak for the year. And they haven\u2019t been that weak, because you have had these price increases in March and you had these price increases in April. And whereas one could anticipate that they wouldn\u2019t hold for a long time, so far, so good for the producers. They have helped quite a lot. So therefore this has happened and we will have in the second half a negative impact, which is in fact eliminating the positive impact from lower \u2013 from better currency movements that we were anticipating. So we are going to have a negative formula pricing there. And I just don\u2019t know what to tell you because I don\u2019t think that resin prices would be where they are as I wouldn\u2019t ask that they would be at the beginning of the year where they are right now. So yes, capacity is going to come in next year and so on. And the whole thing will very much depend on hurricane. We are entering the hurricane season. So some people are wishing for lots of hurricane and some wish for nothing, etcetera. So it\u2019s very difficult to predict one. If you have one or two hurricanes hitting Texas, I tell you this is going to change the game.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Philip Ng", "Hi guys. Should we expect the product rationalization on Product Care largely behind you at this point and will that help firm up demand despite some of the weakness you are calling in the industry economy and stabilize or kind firm up price in the back half, I would have thought given some of the mix improvements you are doing on e-commerce, that would have kind of helps down pricing? Thanks.", "Jerome Peribere", "Hi, Phil, good questions \u2013 so some comments on the economy. Our industrial parts is today moving forward than the e-commerce parts. The e-commerce and 3PL is growing and it\u2019s growing very nicely, but it is still at the 30% and. And this is where our growth is going to be. We anticipate that we can take full advantage of our equipment and our consumables in that market sector. We are completely reinventing this division and it is growing absolutely fabulous. I told you, I told you at the very beginning of this year, I told you at the end of last year that you will be surprised with our innovation momentum and customer pickup over time and starting in the second half. We have all the time to confirm that this is going on. So, now rationalization, I told you also in January that we have just divested from historic line in the U.S., which is $15 million of sales. I told you that we were going to be closing in the second quarter on the plant and the product line in France. And I think I told you that was about $12 million.", "So to your question, yes, we believe that this is basically over in terms of product rationalization there. We have and you are going to look at Brexit. And the Brexit is having an impact on our translation cost. We have a strong business in Product Care, in Food Care also, in Diversey Care also in the UK. So, what we have been clearly doing here is that we have announced for a 6% to 8% price increase effective September 1 later, sometimes earlier, in order to capture the transaction costs that we are suffering from the UK pound. And that is what I would say embedded in our culture now, which is don\u2019t take those kind of things and absorb it, because we are not in that business. So, we have communicated that to our customers, we are moving on. And actually between you and me, we have been a little bit surprised by how easy this is going through, because everybody understands that this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be.", "Carol Lowe", "Yes. And so I think it\u2019s also important and it\u2019s on our slides that just to highlight four products here, the continued strong improvement in margins. So, for the second quarter an improvement of 40 basis points over a year ago on our adjusted EBITDA and for the full half, a 60 basis point improvement and when you look at the challenges with the industrial market that Jerome has highlighted, I think that\u2019s just very, very strong performance by the team.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Please proceed.", "Adam Josephson", "Thanks. Good morning. Jerome or Carol, just one clarification on organic sales growth, I think last quarter you stopped disclosing a growth target and there was some weakness in Brazil and Venezuela that you called out. Now, I think Jerome you are saying that the impact of lower resin prices is having a profound impact on your organic net sales, dollar sales. You are also talking about global economic weakness as evident in industrial conditions, tourism etcetera. So, I am just trying to understand exactly what the puts and takes are in terms of your organic sales forecast now compared to where it was 6 months ago. It would really be helpful. Thank you.", "Jerome Peribere", "Yes, good question. So, what did I say at the beginning of the year, I said about 2.5%. And what you are seeing is that it\u2019s going to be slightly less than 3%. And that is not because of volume, it is because of resin prices and a little bit of weakness in the sectors on hospitality that I just talked about, but those kinds of things and situations are happening every single day. Every single day we have positives and we have negatives. So, if resin prices have \u2013 would have gone up another 10%, you would have seen our sales growth go up more than what I would have said at the beginning of the year and 3.5%. And there is a lag on those kind of things because of the pricing. So, the real question to say is that, so you were saying 3.5%, you are saying slightly less than 3%, is there a problem? Well, no, it\u2019s basically when you have a raw material, which is a part of your cost base and when you have formulas, which in time correct for your overall pricing without impacting your margin, you have \u2013 you booked slightly less dollar sales. If we have resin prices going up or doubling in the next 5 years was you are going to see proportional improvements from Sealed Air, which was not necessarily the case under a few years ago, you are going to see a proportional increase in our top levered sales. So, that separates what is an external environment, which impacts potentially your net sales, but not your margins with internal issues. Let me confirm to you point blank very clearly, we are ahead of everything we said we would be doing in our Investor Day. Our innovation is kicking in better. And this is what is going to fuel our margin and our business in the future.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Chris Manuel", "Good morning. And I guess I want to kind of follow-up here, because I am still a little bit confused on a couple of topics. Look I think coming into the year to kind of come back to Adam\u2019s point, you guys were anticipating a pointer I think it was 3%ish plus growth with 2% of it being organic and one being priced. And now as material costs are falling, I mean, my understanding was for a lot of your formulaic pass-throughs that it\u2019s basically passing through and then it doesn\u2019t have a dollar impact to Sealed Air. It sounds now like maybe Jerome what you are saying is that while you are still on track to get volume growth to the back half of the year to make up that piece that the revenue growth might not be there because some of the mechanisms are lowering price. Is there something perhaps different in the competitive landscape today that\u2019s not enabling you to \u2013 or that\u2019s cutting price perhaps more than just what the formulas are moving that\u2019s impeding your ability to kind of work on the net price side? What\u2019s changed perhaps from a quarter or so ago to today or this has progressed?", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay. Well, Chris I don\u2019t know how to say that. I told you nothing. I told you that we had 3% growth in Food Care in North America in the second quarter, not bad actually. We had, in the second quarter, 3% growth. I told you that we had slightly less than 6% negative growth in Latin America. If you take out Venezuela, again in Food Care, if you take out Venezuela, we would have had volume growth in Latin America. So, things are stabilizing. We are very happy with what\u2019s going on in Brazil. The way our management, local management, has turned things around and very key. We are doing very well in EMEA and this is all about Food Care and we have about the same in Product Care and Diversey Care. So, what I am telling you here, we have given you a guidance of about 6850 for the total year in total sales. We have benefit some on currency on the one side. And what I have just talked about a few minutes ago is giving you the answer on the net selling price, which is impacted by the resin cost and the formula pricing. So, you were referring to competition. Well, look at our competition and look at how we are growing our volumes compared to how our competition is growing volume. Product Care is growing fabulous. Food Care is growing fabulous. And we are doing very well. We had a bumper year, record year in Diversey Care at the very same time.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.", "Chip Dillon", "Yes, good morning. Jerome, could you give us a quick view of how the beef business is looking for you guys in Food Care around the world and how things may have changed since the last call?", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay. So, let me start with the good news, which is that Australia beef cycle is stabilizing. It\u2019s only down 0.5%, which is better than originally anticipated. Remember that it was exactly 12 months ago going gangbusters with a 10% growth in the slaughter rates, which was clearly unsustainable and then it went down over the fourth quarter and first quarter. Now, it seems that it is stabilizing there. You have the volumes in North America and which have been going up. And now you are going to see this have been nicely going up in the second quarter. It seems to be a sign for a very slight pause in the third quarter, but that\u2019s going to be because of the very heavy second quarter harvest. But overall, it is anticipated to increase by over 3.5%. So that trend is on and it\u2019s moving. And you know that over the cycle, we are going to move from about 22 million had slaughtered to 27 million, 28 million by the end of the decade. That is on its way. When \u2013 then, in \u2013 you look at the situation in Russia, which is developing its herd, etcetera, things are positive. By the way, our business down there is doing absolutely wonderful. And when you look at how our local business is going, Russia is up by 15%. Spain is up by 8%. And the exports of meat in \u2013 out of Brazil have started to improve and things are going better. So I would say that what we were anticipating is really happening. And I can once again assure you that we have a high share in that business and we continue to gain share. Thanks to our bags business, and thanks to our Darfresh on Tray and to OptiDure.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Mark Wilde", "Good morning Jerome. Good morning Carol. Just to follow on Chip\u2019s question there, Jerome, is it possible for you to give us some sense of the size of your North American beef business versus the size of your beef business in all of those offshore markets?", "Jerome Peribere", "No, we don\u2019t publish. We don\u2019t give that. But we have given indication of the overall market impact. Our \u2013 globally, our fresh red meat market is about 30% of our total sale. And that\u2019s as much as we give. But I have given indications in the previous earnings call about how to size this kind of business.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, I think we have time for one or two more questions please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes on the line of Jason Freuchtel of SunTrust. Please proceed.", "Jeff D\u2019Angelo", "Hi, good morning. This is just Jeff D\u2019Angelo sitting in for Jason Freuchtel. My first question is when do you expect to be able to quit making restructuring payments, are you still anticipating generating $775 million in free cash flow by 2018. And on top of that, how should we see CapEx trending over the next few years?", "Carol Lowe", "Okay. Good morning Jeff. I will take that. With respect to the guidance that we provided, just as a reminder, the expense that we will see this year to hit the P&L is estimated \u2013 the cash related to that at approximately $110 million. And we also within CapEx activities for our new campus and other restructuring investment of around $140 million. If we look at the cash flow as we move forward that approximately, restructuring cash payments for 2017, we have previously stated around $95 million. And then some will trail into 2018. But we should be substantially done in 2017. We always remind everyone though, that it\u2019s not as easy to forecast as it relates to certain actions we have take in various countries. And some of our restructuring is also related to our footprint optimization for supply chain. And the timing of some of that spend, capital and related expense can be very lumpy.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please proceed.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Good morning. Just going back to the discussion of weaker hospitality demand in Middle East and I think you mentioned Europe as well, is it possible to size how much of a hit that was in the second quarter or maybe how much of a hit you might have baked into the second half guidance or maybe what percentage of your hospitality demand in Diversey is in these regions where you have seen some impact from macro events?", "Ilham Kadri", "So I can take it. On Diversey Care, as you know Q2 is our strongest quarter historically and the results are in line with that. Quarter three is a hospitality quarter, right, its seasonal business, although hospitality is only 10% to 12% of our business globally through the year. And as you know, trends are weakening in Europe, Middle East and Africa because of the political unrest, you heard me say it\u2019s tough, but in fact, we did okay in quarter two and you are all familiar with what\u2019s going on. So tourism is suffering and we suffer from all of this. Therefore, we will experience a slowdown. And that\u2019s why in quarter three you will see a slowdown of the pace of the growth in Diversey Care. I remain confident longer term about the regional promise and the sector promise as we went through this several times in our life, right. And the business is extremely resilient. We have very good people there. They have been through turbulences several times and the fundamentals longer term are extremely good. Anything to add, Jerome?", "Jerome Peribere", "I would say that it explains \u2013 no, we like to be very transparent on all of those things. It doesn\u2019t mean that it has a huge impact. What we are saying is that we have as a result of all the good initiatives that we have taken, we have a fabulous quarter in the second quarter in Diversey Care and it\u2019s not going to be another record quarter ever in the third quarter. But we are pretty confident on our growth. We have had a companion annual growth rate in the last few years in our line of about 12% in constant currency. And we are going to be optimistic that this is going to continue.", "Carol Lowe", "And before we go to last question, Lori cut me off before I give an answer to Jeff\u2019s question on the 2018 target. So just to go quickly back to that with respect to free cash flow, we are continuing to drive towards the targets that we shared in June 2015 at our Analyst Day, focusing on profitable growth and remain confident in the business\u2019 ability to deliver on the growth rate and profitability improvement. We have always been a strong free cash flow generator and expect to be as we move forward. Obviously, the risk relates to currency. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s out of our control, but we always do our best to mitigate that. And Jerome talked about our actions from a pricing standpoint when we see devaluation.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you. Operator, I am not sure if there is one more person in the queue, but otherwise I think we actually have hit our time.", "Operator", "Yes, you do have one final question from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you.", "Brian Maguire", "Thanks for squeezing me in. Jerome, I just wanted to ask you about dimensional pricing for a minute, just curious how the customer adoption on that has gone so far. And I know you signed some strategic partnerships during the quarter, just wondering if you could expand upon what those will allow you to do that you couldn\u2019t do on your own. And then just finally, when do you think we will start to see this kind of moves the needle on the volume or price numbers for the Product Care segment? Thanks.", "Jerome Peribere", "So, as I mentioned, weight and pricing is a big booster to our business. Thanks to our B+ and FloWrap technologies, etcetera, our new Korrvu innovation also providing all of the sales. Just to answer very short your question. You are going to see all of this in the third \u2013 and especially in the fourth quarter, because Q4 is an e-commerce quarter. And all the cards are set for a bumper quarter there. And I can\u2019t be more pleased with the transformation of that division. I have made no mystery that we are just completely revolutionizing this industry. Our customers are responding. And not only they are responding to [indiscernible], but they are responding to something, which is very, very new, which is that they will now start to understand that the packaging look, how you present your products through e-commerce packaging is very important. We have all kinds of studies and we are continuing them and we are going to publish them at Pack Expo are showing that the image of the retailer or of the e-commerce company is dramatically conveyed through the packaging, which is by the way something that you could very instinctively understand. And as a result of this, our new Korrvu line is actually getting a lot of traction. So, come to Pack Expo, you will be very positive.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, I believe there is one question in the follow-up queue. It looks like George Staphos is trying to ask a follow-up question. If you see him in the queue, can you please open his lines?", "Operator", "Yes. Mr. Staphos, your line is now open. And Mr. Staphos has just disconnected his line.", "Lori Chaitman", "Okay. Alright, thank you very much for everybody joining us today. And if you have any follow-up additional calls, please reach out to myself and I will be happy to follow-up. Thank you.", "Jerome Peribere", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed ma'am.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you and good morning everyone. Sorry for the delayed start we had some technical difficulties. Before we begin our call today I would like to note that we have provided slide presentations to help guide our discussions. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at www.sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating Management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed on our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q which you can also find on our website at Www.sealedair.com.", "We discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Included in today's presentation on slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation. ", "Now turn the call over to Jerome Peribere our President and CEO. Jerome.", "Jerome Peribere", "Thank you Lori and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today in addition to our review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a tax free spin off of Diversey Care and our related hygiene business. As planned, we have Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, joining Carol for our third quarter discussion, and I also invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care and Karl Deily, President of Food Care to join us during this important Q&A session. Let me get started.", " In the third quarter we reported $304 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales of $1.7 billion. Our margin increased cash flow performance in the quarter is a testament to our strong operational discipline and working capital management despite soft organic sales growth of 1%. We're pleased to report adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.7% or 50 basis points improvement over last year. And we generated $212 million of free cash flow during Q3 as compared with $191 million for the same quarter last year. I will provide a few comments and then give this to Carol and Ken.", "Our price mix discipline came through in the quarter with all regions delivering favorable trends except North America primarily due to timing of raw materials cost [Indiscernible] in Food Care. Let me highlight volume growth which was largely driven by our execution of our changed again strategy. Product Care volumes in North America were up 7% if you exclude the 100 basis points of rationalization. Diversey Care delivered positive volume in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific as a result of customer wins, and Food Care protein packaging volumes were led by more than 5% growth in North America and positive trends in the EMEA region. These positive volume trends are very important to us as they are strong indications of what is to come into year end and in 2017.", "Unfortunately our business suffered from some softness in Latin America, Middle East, and Australia and continued weakness in the general industrial GDP. You can see that we have and will continue to take corrective actions to preserve our bottom line guidance and commit to our free cash flow in 2017. Such agility is now in our DNA. ", "With that said let me turn back to our decision to pursue the tax free spin of Diversey. By separating our Food Care, Product Care, and medical business from our Diversey Care and related hygiene business we create two pure play industry leading companies with strong financial profiles, each with its own unique and compelling investment opportunity. We believe that this is the appropriate next step in our Company's transformation and will accelerate profitable growth for both entities.", "Before I get into the rationale, I will quickly highlight the structure of the transaction on slide 5. Following completion of the tax free spin, Sealed Air shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of what I would call New Diversey. Both New Sealed Air and New Diversey will be well capitalized with disciplined return based approaches to capital allocation.", "We anticipate a similar credit rating to existing Sealed Air as both companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017 and we anticipate timing of the form ten as early as the first quarter of 2017, which will provide you with independent standalone financials for New Diversey. ", "So now let's turn to slide 6. Where we highlight the strategic rationale for the separation. This separation will give both entities the ability to tailor the strategic objectives and capitalize on global growth opportunities both at the core of their businesses and with respect to innovative and disruptive technologies. New Sealed Air and New Diversey will have leaner and more streamlined operations and will become even more entrepreneurial. I want to spend a few minutes highlighting both New Sealed Air and New Diversey.", "First New Sealed Air on slide 7. Many of you have heard me say this before, but I will say it again. We believe that our Food Care and Product Care divisions are by far the most innovative leaders in their respective industries with unmatched global scale and reach. In short we are market makers.", "Over the last three plus years we extended this leadership globally with new innovative product offerings and consultative services. Adjusted EBITDA for our Food Care division, excluding the hygiene business and our Product Care division, has reported a three year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% in constant dollars.", "To give you a sense of the size and the margin profile on an as reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin for New Sealed Air reported approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the last 12 months ending September 30, 2016. ", "New Sealed Air will continue to generate strong free cash flow which will support future growth initiatives and value-added M&A. And consistently return value to shareholders.", "Let me turn to Slide 8 on New Diversey. Under the Sealed Air umbrella both Diversey Care and our hygiene business streamline their organizations, revamp their product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, reenergize energy with a renewed focus on disruptive solutions, and embrace a truly entrepreneurial culture which makes them be the most innovative player in the industry. All of which have contributed to consistent top-line growth what will make the New Diversey and has generated a three-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15% in adjusted EBITDA on a constant-dollar basis.", "Our innovative platforms including the Internet of Things, Intellibot robotics, clean-in-place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others, are enabling us to win new customers around the world. And in a separate announcement you saw that our branded licensing agreement with SCJ will expire in May 2017. We have already started working on developing new partnerships as announced yesterday morning with Spectrum and Nacoma. We will also look for opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow our own brand into new channels.", "Given the low capital requirements and free cash flow generation, New Diversey will have the flexibility to invest in growth and return value to shareholders. In short, you have in Sealed Air what a renowned industry analyst once called the ATM you want to own. Now you will have two ATM machines. With that, let me now turn the call to Carol for a look at the financial results for the third quarter. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 9 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the third quarter. The two regions that deliver constant-dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume with positive trends across our three divisions. In Latin America, constant-dollar growth was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations.", "In EMEA positive trends in Food Care were offset by declines in Diversey Care and Product Care. Performance in Asia-Pacific was primarily impacted by a 14% decline in Australia. The Australian beef market is significantly depressed with slaughter rates at their lowest levels in 20 years. Australia accounts for approximately 6% of Food Care's net sales.", "Turning to Slide 10, we highlight volume and price mix trends by division and by region. We have already highlighted key volume trends, so I will focus my comments on price mix. You can see from this slide that with the exception of North America, we have had positive price mix in all regions for three consecutive quarters.", "Food Care's price mix was positive on a global basis, despite North America being negatively impacted by the timing of raw material pass-throughs. Diversey Care delivered favorable price mix across all regions which has been consistent throughout the years. In Product Care, strong e-commerce volumes are currently having a negative impact on mix.", "Turning to slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year over year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales on essentially flat volume. Price mix contributed $15 million to top line growth. Unfavorable currency translation was $31 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. ", "Now turning to slide 12, we present our adjusted EBITDA bridge. I would like to note that our adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points from 36.4% in Q3 2015 to 37.3% in Q3 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $22 million favorable and we realized $10 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses had an impact of $21 million of which salary and wage inflation was $17 million.", "Currency was a negative $4 million and divestitures were $3 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. We repurchased 3.5 million shares for approximately $165 million and exited the third quarter with 194 million shares outstanding. ", "Let me now turn the call over to Ken to go through our results by division.", "Ken Chrisman", "Thank you Carol. Slide 13 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were unchanged on a year over year basis. Rationalization efforts in North America and Europe had a negative impact on constant dollar sales of approximately 200 basis points. We reported a record level of EBITDA margin of nearly 23%, an increase of 160 basis points, which is notable given the raw material environment and a soft industrial sector. ", "As you heard from both Jerome and Carol, our third quarter sales performance was due to strength in ecommerce and fulfillment. We delivered nearly 4% sales growth in North America adjusted for rationalization. North America accounts for approximately 60% of Product Care's total sales. Volume accelerated throughout the quarter and we continue to see good growth in October.", "Our thought leadership in providing solutions to ecommerce and fulfillment sectors is resulting in accelerated adoption of our more profitable differentiated innovations, including inflatable bubble, core view, and B+ equipment, complemented by record levels of equipment installations. We're also seeing expanded adoption of our protective mailers as customers respond to dimensional weight and pricing challenges.", "Adding into yearend, we expect growth in e-commerce and fulfillment to accelerate and drive top- and bottom-line performance. Our robust equipment installations fueled by our new offerings give us confidence in achieving accelerated growth. While we're not seeing much of a rebound from the industrial sector, our customers in this sector are expressing increased interest in our new offerings as they address the impact of dimensional weight and pricing.", "Let's turn now to Slide 14 and review Food Care results. Favorable price mix, positive volume trends in North America and Europe, and disciplined cost management were key contributors to sales and EBITDA performance in the third quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on 1% sales growth. EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to just over 21%. Production of all proteins in North America and Europe were up in the third quarter.", "On one hand, our business is reaping the benefits of higher beef volumes and continued global adoption of our new products. On the other hand, these positive trends are being offset by the challenging business environments in Asia-Pacific, particularly in Australia as Carol mentioned, and Latin America which took a turn for the worse in September after trends appeared to be stabilizing. In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in sales and adjusted EBITDA, with accelerating volume trends in North America and Europe offsetting continued weakness in Australia and Latin America.", "Let's turn to Diversey Care results on Slide 15. Diversey Care net sales were up 1.5% in constant dollars and adjusted EBITDA margins were 13%. Growth in the quarter was driven by new-customer rollouts in North America and Europe, and positive trends in Asia-Pacific. We were pleased to see North America deliver growth in light of a tough comparable. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant-dollar sales growth, and in Asia-Pacific growth was led by strength in China and India.", "These positive trends were partially offset by declines in the Middle East. As we anticipated, the hospitality sector, particularly in Turkey, continues to struggle as a result of significant declines in tourism and occupancy rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect a positive trend in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific to continue and more than offset challenges in Latin America and Middle East. Customer rollouts are on schedule and our listing strategic wins across all sectors continues to grow.", "Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?", "Carol Lowe", "Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 16, free cash flow was a source of cash of $280 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $82 million for the nine months ended September 30. CapEx increased to $190 million which includes $71 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $23 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. CapEx during the same period last year was $112 million.", "Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $225 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion. The impact on the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $35 million. We continue to anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. As Jerome and Ken highlighted, our growth in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of 90 million for the full year 2016.", "Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at 218 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately 275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.60. We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately 550 million. CapEx is expected to be 275 million, which includes approximately 125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at 150 million.", "For the full year we expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately 80 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at 90 million. And we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately 40 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be 210 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at 125 million.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our fourth-quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 9. With that, operator can you please open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "George Staphos", "Hi everyone, thanks for the details and good luck with the transaction. I will try to ask a two part question, not to cheat too much. In food and beverage, is there a way to parse how the drag that you are seeing in emerging markets may lessen in the fourth quarter such that we might be able to peg what the broader food volume might look like in the quarter, and then the related question would be, in the past and understandably the portfolio decision previously wasn't your decision. The company has talked about the benefits of having the hygiene business in conjunction with food packaging. Explain to us why whatever synergy there might have been isn't as important on a going forward basis. Thank you, guys.", "Karl Deily", "Okay so this is Karl and I will start with your second question first that's okay. We have had synergies with the hygiene business. However, the natural fit is to keep the hygiene business with the Diversey Care business due to the synergies of supply chain and a number of other things. And obviously our ability to partner going forward will still be there. But they are two different businesses with two different sales processes and sales cycles and we feel it is the most prudent thing to do to include them in the spin. Now on your first question, I wish I could answer Latin America.", "We thought that Brazil had bottomed out and Argentina was going along relatively well, and they both took a turn for the worse at the end of the quarter which had an impact. We still had very good positive growth going in the northern cone of Latin America so we obviously are keeping our pulse on the market and our key customers and having very good introduction of new products and value added products in Latin America. So as soon as the market does start to turn positive, we expect to get an accelerated growth. But we just have to stay close to that market because it is volatile.", "Lori Chaitman ", "George do you have a follow up or are you good?", "George Staphos", "I will turn it over and try to come back just to be fair. Thanks.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you George. Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. ", "Scott Gaffner", "Jerome, you made a comment in your opening remarks. You said the separation between Diversey and legacy Sealed Air would create a leaner and more entrepreneurial environment, you said for both businesses, but I'm just trying to square that with the move to Charlotte. You spent tens of millions, almost $100 million on a new headquarters to create a larger more centralized organization, so is there something that changed along the way where Diversey didn't fit within that more centralized model? Can you flush those the diverging comments out?", "Jerome Peribere", "So for those who know me well I hate centralization. What I want to do is to make sure that we have centers of excellence, and this is what we will be creating and that's where we are creating in our new campus. Having said that, it is not because I don't like the Diversey business. It is because we believe that by having those two entities separated we'll create a better shareholder value for both entities. You have to realize that the old Diversey was a faint shadow of what it is now. It really woke up a very traditional industry.", "We are not seeing this yet in sales growth. We've seen sales growth, but it's nothing compared to what this New Diversey business is going to be over the years to come. Think about the Internet of Clean. 100% biodegradable products, trico sunsee products, robotics. By the way at the ISSA this week, we're announcing a new alliance on robotics with discovery robotics, and that's going to even increase the pace of our differentiation with our potential competitors.", "Think about dry lubensee: this is a very strong self-standing entity. And when you think about what we have done in the past three years we have an improvement of profitability of what is now to be called the New Diversey on order of 15% EBITDA improvement on a compounded annual growth rate in the last three years. Very frankly, it's ready to fly from its own wings. It is going to enable an even more entrepreneurial approach. I really believe it is the right time.", "Scott Gaffner", "Just a quick follow up on the capital allocation there. You said you were going to have the same capital structure at each business. But you said Diversey has lower capital requirements and relatively high free cash flow. Is there a reason why you wouldn't maybe have a higher leverage ratio at Diversey spend versus the legacy business?", "Jerome Peribere", "We are working on all of this Scott, and you will see all of that in our Form 10. We have preliminary numbers at this point in time. You will be able to own two ATM machines now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson, Keybanc. Please go ahead.", "Adam Josephson", "Question on volume trends, you're up about 1% in the first quarter, up 0.5% in the second quarter, you were flattish this quarter, can you big picture talk about what has changed as the year has unfolded, and what you expect to happen next year with respect to volume. I know you talked at the Analyst Day Jerome about expecting a pretty significant acceleration volume growth in the years to come, do you still think that's a reasonable expectation just in light of what's unfolded this year and if so why?", "Jerome Peribere", "Let me be very transparent as I like to always be. I have been a bit disappointed with our 1% growth in Q3. But these are two different stories. At that time I did not anticipate the severity of the Australia reduction in the beef market. At that time being in July when I announced the second quarter results, we were coming from a strong Latin American Brazilian recovery on the beef markets, because it was volume growth was there, et cetera and it didn't continue.", "It has been just a little positive blip, and as Karl by their way said on Food Care, northern LATAM is very strong and southern LATAM is bad. At that time I was fearing that we would be hurt as Ilham had clearly said we were going to be impacted by the instability of the Middle East and the hospitality business in markets like France, Belgium, and Germany, and we have been a little bit more.", "Having said that, and to come to your question, I am very pleased with what we are seeing in some very key markets where we are executing on changed again strategies. North American. Food Care has had a 3.5% volume growth in the third quarter. North American Product Care has had, which is a very key market for us, very big for us in Product Care, has had a 7% volume growth when you exclude the 100 basis points from the divestitures from the portfolio rationalization, and Diversey Care had a very tough comparable in the first Porter and yet has been positive.", "That tells me that we should be confident on Q4, and I am confident on Q4, and what is going to be really the barometer for me, is going to be how are we going to grow volume in Q4 and in each of those three divisions. And I can assure you that we are projecting volume growth in Q4 in each of those divisions, and slowly volume growth and that's definitely in our mind is showing the cutoff between the trends in 2015 and '16 into 2017.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you Adam, do you have a follow-up?", "Adam Josephson", "Carol, just a quick one just on cash flow. Just in light of some of the changes you made to your projections on cash restructuring, interest, et cetera. Carol can you just remind us what you talked about as far as 2017 as far as CapEx, cash restructuring, working cap, cash taxes, et cetera, just so we have some early bridge to 2017 on the cash flow-line Carol? Thanks very much.", "Carol Lowe", "Adam, what we have referenced for CapEx for 2017 was that we would be at approximately 200 million, and actually have said that would be the number going forward. Obviously with all of our numbers, we'll have to update post then as we look at our working capital for the consolidated Sealed Air it was estimated to be positive cash flow of approximately 50 million for 2017. We had not given specific guidance relative to tax payment for 2015. We are projecting 125 million for 2016.", "They will be slightly higher than that as we move forward. If we look at restructuring payments we had originally said cash payments for restructuring would be approximately 100 million excluding CapEx restructuring. As we have reduced the amount that we anticipate to spend in 2016 to 90 million, that difference because we were previously at 110 million we would increase 2017 by 20 million. So in total for 2016 and 2017 we would stay at the 210 million, but we'll have a shift into 2017.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please Proceed.", "Brian Maguire", "Jerome I have a couple questions about Diversey all along those same lines. But first I was just wondering before and after the spin if you considered trying to find a strategic partner for it or if there was any thought about ever trying to sell the business? Kind of related to that, wondering if that were to be an option if you'd have any significant tax leakage? And then, just a third part of that, just wondering after you spin it if you'd expect any restrictions on anybody being able to buy New Diversey, and any tax implications that can come back to New Sealed Air? Thanks.", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay so again good question. The spin is a tax-free operation as you know and the potential there would be a taxable operation and my responsibility is to ensure maximum shareholder value. We are reviewing the tax basis as we are merging many legal entities, but the board has been authorized to evaluate a spin based on the information it has and therefore supported the spin. So that's what I can say. Once again as a standalone company it's going to thrive over time.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please. Brian do you have a follow-up?", "Brian Maguire", "Just one if I can sneak one in. I think Jerome, at one point you talked about Diversey getting to a 15% margin. I recognize there will be some incremental corporate expense and hygiene part of Food Care would be in there a little bit. But just wondering if that's still an aspirational target for Diversey that is reasonable?", "Jerome Peribere", "It's not an aspiration. It is what I really believe it can deliver. So you heard two things. You heard me say for a long time and Dr. Kadri said also, we're on our way and we have been improving double digit the EBITDA of the Diversey Care business by about 12% per year in the last three years. On a constant currency basis. What you heard me also say a few minutes ago in my prepared remarks is that when you take the New Diversey, which includes the hygiene business over the last three years we had a 15% compounded annual growth rate in EBITDA and this is the result of innovation, of rationalization, a new way to go to market, et cetera.", "The separation of Diversey has nothing to do with any disappointment of the situation. I'm actually bullish about the prospect of that. So the 15% target by 2018 is still here, strong and standing and when you compare 2016 with 2015 you will continue to see the progress and compare it again with 2014, we're seeing that on and on and very solid.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you Brian. Operator next question please?", "Operator", "We don't have any details unfortunately, so please state your name and company name. No response there. Your next call comes from the line of Jason Freuchtel, please go ahead and state your company name.", "Jason Freuchtel", "Hi, good morning this is Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust.", "Lori Chaitman", "Hi Jason", "Jason Freuchtel", "You guys repurchased an impressive 3.5 million shares in the quarter, and it looks like you still have a little bit of room to increase your leverage within your targeted range. Do you want to maintain some cushioning or leverage ratio given the current macro environment, or are there any other plain uses of cash in the near term that would prevent you from being equally or more aggressive in repurchasing shares in the near term?", "Carol Lowe ", "Thank you Jason. As we have stated before our leverage target is 3.5 to 4 times. We came out of Q3 at approximately 3.8 times or about flat with where we were at the end of June this year. We are very cognizant of some of the macroeconomic challenges that are out there on a global basis. And as we have always said, based on indications from the economy and how our various markets are performing, we would move between that 3.5 to 4.", "Right now, we see some good points and some conservatism. We have been active in the market, and we have still a lot outstanding in the approved program from the Board of Directors. We actually have $884 million that still available under the board authorization. So management will take the action that is appropriate given the leverage and given the performance of the business, which we see is continuing to improve and get stronger as Jerome noted in his remarks headed into Q4 and into 2017.", "Jerome Peribere", "In fact we have $670 million left in the authorization. We have $670 million left, and what we will have to review is our leverage ratio band as we separate the two entities. What I can assure you, and actually this is led by Carol, is we're not going to increase the leverage because we don't feel it is appropriate. But we will review all of those and we will guide in the future about those.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde. Please state your company name.", "Mark Wilde", "Hi, it's Mark Wilde from BMO. Good morning Jerome, good morning Carol. A couple of questions, first is a possible Carol to quantify the cost to Diversey of being a separate public company?", "Carol Lowe", "We're still in the process of preparing the standalone financials and they will be available when we file the form 10. So we're not prepared to comment on those at this time.", "Mark Wilde", "No ballpark estimates or anything?", "Jerome Peribere", "No speculation.", "Mark Wilde", "And then I wondered if either Jerome or Carol could talk with us a little bit about how you see the impact of resin prices in the fourth quarter, just in terms of lags between when resin moves and when your product pricing might move?", "Jerome Peribere", "So the polyethylene situation is right now is a big question and you have CDI and HIS which are projecting a slight reduction over time. Some are saying that the $0.05 will be given back. You know that the October increase didn't go through et cetera. So as you say as you know we had to take a little bit of time so there's been an impact on our cost and all of this is included in our Q4 EBITDA projection.", "Mark Wilde", "Can you give us any sense of what the size of that might be?", "Jerome Peribere", "No that's too much detail here, but as we say as you know we are and agile organization. We make sure that our pricing discipline is staying intact and when you look at the gross profit of Sealed Air you have seen in the third quarter we have increased our gross profits by about 70 basis points, which just shows that we are very focused on those kind of things and it is as valid, same thing for the Food Care division.", "Mark Wilde", "Finally if I could Jerome, your margins are kind of back in both of the packaging businesses, where the company had margins in the late 90s and early 2000s. What's the additional run rate that you see in both businesses?", "Jerome Peribere", "As we introduce our knowledge base solutions, as I hope you were going to be coming to Pack Expo and your jaw is going to fall if you do. You will see the we do have margin expansion opportunities, both in product care and in Food Care. By the way PackEx, you will also see our innovation in Food Care, which is why I'm taking that opportunity to once again invite everybody to come and see the New Sealed Air and Sealed Air at Pack Expo, and to come and visit the potential for New Diversey at the ISSA this week, and also going to have some robotics at Pack Expo the week of November 7.", "By working that booth, either this week at ISSA or at Pack Expo week of November 7, you will be able to realize that it's not necessary for me to highlight the changed again strategy because they are there and a visit is worth 1000 words.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you. Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Edlain Rodriguez", "Thank you, good morning guys. One quick question and this is a follow-up to the resin costs going up. Jerome can you talk about the levers you have to offset those costs for the customers that don't have formula-based pricing? How quickly can you go to those other customers to raise prices to offset higher costs?", "Jerome Peribere", "Okay well first of all we have for a long time moved from a cost plus-based company to a value-creating company. We're seeing this all the time. When you look at this, if I just tell you that for meat processor packaging is less than 1% of the cost, it's nothing compared to the value that we create to them. And we create value to the meat processes, we create value to the retailers by reducing food waste, meat waste, et cetera, et cetera.", "So we're just not pricing based on our cost. So this concept that the price goes up when resin prices go up and the price go down when resin prices go down is not the right concept. With some customers we do have a formula. And we apply those formulas. But I think it's very important to see that like every company we do have a commodity business and we make sure we are competitive in the commodity business. And as a solutions business we just don't price according to our costs.", "Lori Chaitman", "Do you have a follow-up question?", "Edlain Rodriguez", "Yes I do. One quick one on the spinoff decision. When you look at another two companies, now they are going to be separate, was there any reason why you wanted to do the separation. For example, can you give any examples of any constraints that you had between New Diversey and New Sealed Air by being together in terms of transactions you wanted to do, but couldn't do because it didn't make sense for one part of the portfolio, or investments you have to forego by being together?", "Jerome Peribere", "Carol has talked to you about the synergies between food packaging and food hygiene and they are very small. So that's point number one. Then you go and look at whether the R&D is similar. It is not, in one case you are dealing with chemicals and you are dealing basically with chemicals on the other side you are dealing with specialty highly specialized plastic extrusion et cetera. Then you look at the customer base and the overlap is not very strong. Then actually it is weak. When you look at supply chain and you see the same. So when you really think about it, the synergies are low. So from then on you've got to go and wonder whether you're going there, are things, what is the best solution? The best solution for us was to really look at how we can improve this business and as I said, the old Diversey is a feint shadow of what it is now.", "We now have a winning company in the marketplace. We have value added solution for our customers and when we switch a customer to us it is because they see the differential advantage of our solution and this is why. So it's not so much a question of if it would be a question of when and the reason why we started to do it now is because no kidding, under the leadership of Dr. Kadri, this New Diversey is going to fly very nicely under by its own wing.", "If there was one thing which has been positive, is the creation of one culture and this is why we have leveraged all of those kind of things. And the decision on the campus by the way has been taken in the summer of 2014. At time at which we do not think we would do what we do now, but we're actually doing it now because we do believe that the recovery of the New Diversey has been faster than what we think it could be.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "First up, how should we think about the termination of the SC Johnson relationship? Looks like they're returning to the traditional cleaning business as announced a couple days ago. In your 10 K you highlighted that the loss of the license could have material impact on Diversey, and especially since they're now competitors as well, so how should we think about what offsets you have towards that?", "Jerome Peribere", "So in fact, you got to go back to the Genesis of this agreement. This agreement had been signed between SC Johnson and the Diversey division when Diversey was part of SC Johnson. Between you and me it was not a good long term fit for Diversey. Diversey under Sealed Air offers New Diversey as it is going to be. What you have to look therefore is about the long term and very frankly there are some very strong long-term opportunities.", "So in the short term, it might be a short term downside but that is not the most important thing. We have new agreements in place with spectrum brands. We are working nicely with Nacoma. We are going to have more of those, we're going to be launching our cryovacs better bags. And this is by the way we have verified that this cryovac brand, which will stay with Diversey is a very strong brand and we're going to be continuing to announce more partnerships. This agreement signed under -- long ago when SCJ was owning Diversey was limiting the potential for Diversey.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Okay can ask another question?", "Lori Chaitman", "Go ahead Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "For New Sealed Air, which would be fluid and Product Care, Jerome what you envision the strategy will be longer-term apart from the growth initiatives you have in place. Does it make sense to think about another vertical in the portfolio to complement the remaining segments? You called out farm to fork in your slide deck and hopefully you're not going to acquire farms. But what is your strategic view on the residual portfolio.", "Jerome Peribere", "My view is that focus is a very strong strength of the company and this is going to enable us to do exactly that. So we do have two divisions which are formidable competitors in their space. And what I can assure you is that we're going to be working on reinforcing those two divisions to make them even stronger. We might add another strategic pillar which will have either commonality on technology to leverage our technology, very unique technology, or our common entity on our customer base. We're here to add value to our customers. And I really believe that we're going to be able to do that better. So what you should expect over time is us to reward our shareholders to accelerate our innovation and to increase and to do M&A.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Jerome, at your analyst day you laid out detailed targets for the segments and then a free cash flow goal for the combined company for 2018, and my question is when you look at the 2018 free cash flow goal, do you still feel you can achieve that? Do you have some levers that you can offset the slower organic growth you've seen this year? And in the Form 10, can we expect you will breakout or update the 2018 free cash flow goal between New Sealed Air and New Diversey?", "Jerome Peribere", "I don't think the Form 10 will highlight the New Sealed Air free cash flow goal, but your point is very valid. When we were talking about the free cash flow goals of 2018 was a result of some organic growth that we're seeing, let me remind you that because we have that in mind and I'm reminded that to all my division presidents every single day as they start the day. We said 4% to 5% in Food Care, 4% to 5% in Product Care, and 3% to 4% in Diversey Care, and this was for the period of 2016 through 2018. As I told you, I also told you that the first half of 2016 was going to be mused and we were going to see the growth coming up in the second half.", "I'm not pleased, I told you earlier that I was a little bit disappointed with the first quarter, but I am optimistic about the fourth quarter as I indicated 3% growth and about 2017. So we will update you all of this. The 775 at the time was taking the given assumption on currency and on the world stage, which is not exactly that one. Having said that, we will update you when good time with our 2018 goals, and you always should look for opportunities to expand the margins and maximizing this free cash flow. And as you have seen in an environment which is not been really good this year because of lack of growth, we have been confirming our guidance of free cash flow for 2016. So we are very, very focused on those things.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you Jerome, and Anthony do you have a follow-up?", "Anthony Pettinari", "Just maybe one follow-up with the lower organic growth that you have seen year-to-date, do you think you're tracking end market demand in Food Care and Product Care, or do you feel that you've lost any share or are you seeing any real changes in the competitive dynamics in Food Care and Product Care?", "Jerome Peribere", "Let me be very, very clear. We are increasing our share. There's not a shadow of a doubt.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you Anthony", "Jerome Peribere", "And by the way we are increasing the share thanks to our very powerful innovation. See you the week of November 7 in Pack Expo I hope.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you Jerome and thank you Anthony and thanks everybody for all your questions. Operator that concludes our call.", "Operator", "Thank you very much indeed. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect. Thank you very much.

Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Analysts", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Sealed Air First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. We will have a question-and-answer session later and the instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "Now, I would like to welcome and turn the call to Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website, at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review this information in the section entitled, Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.", "Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we've included in our earnings press release. Included in today's presentation on slide 3 and slide 17, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.", "In addition, on slide 16, we included a reconciliation of previously reported consolidated results to continuing operations for both Q1 and full year 2016, reflecting Diversey as discontinued operations. In the coming weeks, we will publish key metrics for Q2, Q3 and Q4 2016 continuing operations to help with your 2017 analysis for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, our Medical business was integrated into our Food Care business, which is reflected in our results and outlook.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on our call this morning. And during our prepared remarks, we will cover the announced sale of Diversey, and the use of proceeds and how we will address stranded and unallocated costs. We will review in detail our first quarter results and outlook for continuing operations. We will also highlight Diversey results and after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions.", "So, let's get started. On March 27, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, our Diversey Care division and our related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close early September with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. This transaction marks a significant milestone for both Sealed Air and Diversey, and we are committed to a timely and successful separation.", "For Sealed Air, this transaction will give us an even greater focus on executing our profitable growth story and investing in our core business. The increased financial flexibility will enable us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while at the same time, target value-added acquisitions. To address the dilutive impact of this transaction, we increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding our total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion. We will continue our quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share and we will pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain our credit profile.", "In reviewing our first quarter performance for continuing operations, you will see that we had a very solid start of the year. Sales were a $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Food Care sales of $656 million, had constant dollar growth of 2% and Product Care sales of $377 million, had constant dollar growth of 4%, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization efforts in Europe. We are very pleased to see the execution in North America with constant dollar sales growth of 6% and both Food Care and Product Care contributed to this performance with sales growth of 7% and 3% respectively.", "We are also pleased with our EBITDA performance for both Food Care and Product Care. Combined, those two divisions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $216 million or 21% of sales, offset by $34 million in corporate expenses. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $182 million, or 18% of sales. And Carol will provide more details later on the call on corporate expenses, which includes stranded and unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. Diversey, which was recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter, delivered $582 million in sales, an increase of 2% in constant dollars. And if we did not have discontinued operations accounting, adjusted EBITDA would have been $53 million as compared with $48 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of last year. Our comments throughout the rest of this call will be focused on results from continuing operations.", "So let me now turn to slide 5. Our regional performance for Sealed Air. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I just noted, increased 6% in constant dollars. Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, had constant dollars growth of 5.5%. Mexico, by the way, increased 17% and Brazil was up 5%, which was partially offset by 4% decline in Argentina. On a combined basis, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounted for 8% of total company's net sales.", "Asia-Pacific represented 15% of net sales and was flat year-over-year with 10% growth in New Zealand and 9% growth in China. Growth in New Zealand and China was offset by the 12% decline in Australia, due to the beef market downcycle. Australia, New Zealand and China combined accounted for 10% of our total company net sales. EMEA, which accounted for the remaining 21% of the total company net sales, was the only region that declined in the quarter, and the 3.5% decline in constant currency was primarily due to timing of Food Care equipment sales, rationalization efforts in Product Care that were completed in May of last year, and a decline in net sales in Russia related to currency because our pricing is indexed to the euro. On an as-reported basis, Russia was slightly up versus last year.", "Now turning to slide 6, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and region. You can see from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter. We delivered over 7% volume growth in North America with 9% volume growth in Food Care and 6% growth in Product Care. I wanted to note that Sealed Air has not delivered volume growth like this since the recovery in 2010 after the great global recession. Volume growth in North America was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 1.7%. In Food Care, unfavorable pricing was due to timing of raw material cost pass-through, which we expect to turn in the second half of the year. And in Product Care, unfavorable mix was impacted by continued growth in e-Commerce and fulfillment. We announced price increases that began in early Q2, which should help top-line going forward.", "I also want to note that we experienced positive volume trend in Latin America, led by 2% volume growth in Food Care packaging. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2014 that volume contributed to sales growth in this region. Despite improvement in Q1, the consequences of the selective ban on the Brazilin beef exports is expected to slow down the recovery in this local market and negatively impact our volume in Q2 and Q3. But Latin America continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us. And we expect trends to improve as we head into 2018.", "Turning now to slide 7, and review Food Care results in more details. Food Care delivered $656 million in net sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million or margins of 21.6% was impacted by higher input cost. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $139 million. The strength we delivered in North America was not only driven by the increased cattle production in the region, but also growth in fresh pork, smoked and processed meats, and cheeses. North America accounted for 51% of Food Care sales in the first quarter. Latin America, which accounted for 13% of Food Care sales delivered positive volume trends for the first time in several quarters, resulting in 5% constant dollar growth. Growth in North America and Latin America was partially offset by continued weakness in Australia as I talked about, and declines in Europe due to timing of equipment sales and Forex in Russia.", "First half sales was a strong year for \u2013 first half of 2016 was a strong year for equipment in Europe, resulting in a tough year-on-year comparable in Q1. As we head into the second half, we expect equipment sales to return to growth and the EMEA region accounted for 20% of Food Care net sales, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the remaining 16% of sales. For the full-year 2017, we continue to expect Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth with continued strength in North America, improving trends in EMEA, and a more favorable global price/mix as the year progresses, due to the timing of raw materials cost pass-through in North America.", "Slide 8 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization in Europe, which happened in end of May of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million or 19.7% of sales. Performance accelerated through the quarter with all regions delivering positive constant dollar sales and volume growth. North America, which accounted for 62% of Product Care's net sales, increased 3% with strong growth in e-Commerce and fulfillment.", "EMEA accounted for 23% of sales, and increased slightly, driven by high single-digit growth in Germany, offset by flat sales in the UK and declines in France, largely related to the rationalization I've referred to. Asia-Pacific and Latin America combined accounted for the remaining 15% of sales and were up nearly 10% led by strength in China, Japan and Mexico. We continue to grow alongside the rapidly expanding e-Commerce and fulfillment market, and see good areas of stabilization within the industrial sectors. Our new products including B+, FloWrap, StealthWrap, Inflatable Bubble and Automated Mailers are also gaining momentum, across all of our end markets as our customers focus on addressing dimensional weight pricing.", "We expect our automated fulfillment solutions to continue ramping throughout the year and further contribute to our performance. It is worth highlighting that last week we announced with UPS, the opening of a Packaging Innovation Center in Louisville, Kentucky, on the UPS largest Supply Chain Solutions site. We were honored to be selected as UPS partner to help address their customers' packaging and shipping challenges. And this clearly demonstrates the power of our innovative solutions and the ability for UPS and Sealed Air to collaboratively work together to add value to customers around the world.", "For the full 2017, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year, resulting in constant dollar sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Growth within our e-Commerce and fulfillment segment is far surpassing industrial growth.", "And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and our outlook for the full year. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $11 million. Jerome has already provided color on our top-line trends. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $182 million. Volume growth contributed $17 million in Q1. Mix and price/cost spread was $12 million unfavorable. Operating expenses increased $5 million and restructuring savings were $1 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million.", "You can also see on the bridge that we disclose the unallocated costs as a separate item, which were $8 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to $5 million in the first quarter 2016. I will expand on this further when we discuss the 2017 full year guidance. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.43 in the first quarter compared to $0.42 in Q1 2016.", "Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q1 2017 was 14% compared to 19% in Q1 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was favorably impacted by a tax benefit on share-based compensation and benefits related to statute of limitations, expirations and audit settlements.", "Turning to slide 10, we are presenting our free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. In the first quarter, consolidated free cash flow excluding payments related to the Diversey sale was a use of cash of $31 million. CapEx was $50 million. Cash interest payments $48 million. And restructuring costs were $15 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $115 million.", "Now turning to our outlook on slide 11. Net sales from continuing operations for 2017 are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, an increase of over 3% on a constant dollar basis. This forecast assumes approximately 3% constant dollar growth for Food Care and 3% to 4% for Product Care. We expect growth to be driven largely by volume in both businesses. We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $35 million. For continuing operations, our major currency exposures include: the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q1; the Australian dollar at 5%; British pound 4%; and the Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian real, each were approximately 3% of net sales.", "2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $130 million in 2017, which includes $25 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations accounting. These unallocated costs consists of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that did not qualify for discontinued operations. Our goal is to eliminate most of the unallocated costs by the end of 2018. Corporate expenses also include approximately $40 million of stranded costs. Identification of stranded cost is based on a percent of net sales. With a divestiture of this size, we recognize that we need to reduce the size of our corporate expense structure.", "We will be making a concerted effort to reduce stranded costs by 50% and repurpose the balance to support growth initiative. This reduction is planned for the 24-month period following the close of the transaction. Keep in mind that once the transaction closes in September, we will start supporting Diversey through our transition services agreement for up to 12 months to 18 months. We expect to receive approximately $23 million in TSA revenues during this period, which will largely offset the unallocated costs and favorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $5 million.", "Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $195 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt with the net proceeds of the Diversey sale. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $165 million. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.70. Our forecast for EPS is based on the current weighted average shares outstanding of 196 million. Keep in mind that we are no longer restricted on share buybacks, and to address dilution of the sale of Diversey, we will begin buying shares through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. We expect to fund the repurchase program with cash flow generation and net proceeds from the sale of Diversey.", "Let's turn to slide 12 and review our outlook for free cash flow. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, our forecast is based on our estimated full-year outlook for continuing operations and only the first eight months of discontinued operations. Let me walk you through how we estimate our free cash flow for the year. We started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, with $825 million of expected EBITDA from continuing operations and $215 million from the first eight months of discontinued operations, assuming an early September close.", "We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million, and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million of which $165 million represent Sealed Air continuing operations' expenditures. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $25 million in 2017, and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimates. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash at $65 million. As you know, our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation and that is especially true of the Diversey business. With these factors in mind, our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $390 million, excluding cash payments related to the sale of Diversey.", "Looking beyond 2017, our targeted adjusted EBITDA conversion to free cash flow for continuing operations is 50%-plus. I would like to discuss the gross and net proceeds of the sale as highlighted on slide 13. Bain Capital is acquiring Diversey in an all cash transaction valued at $3.2 billion. We expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash taxes are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. The pension liability transferring with Diversey is approximately $200 million and transaction fees and separation costs are anticipated to be $70 million. Restructuring costs to address unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million. The remaining balance includes the other costs and debt-like obligations.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call for to questions, I would like to remind you our second quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August the 3rd.", "With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good. Good morning.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. Just trying to get a better sense of what the free cash flow profile is for the company excluding Diversey and relative to the $390 million you are guiding towards for 2017, what kind of free cash flow will the new Sealed Air generate in 2018 and beyond and what are some of the parameters like CapEx, cash restructuring, cash tax and working capital going to look like going forward?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, we're not prepared to give a number for 2018. We've referenced in my comments to the 50% free cash flow conversion rate that we will be moving to. With respect to CapEx a more normalized basis for us would be approximately $150 million to $160 million and that assumes plenty of room for us to invest for growth, because our maintenance CapEx is somewhere around $100 million for the company. So, any other questions?", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. And, I guess, what's driving the large swing in working capital for this year. I think it was supposed to be an $80 million source before and now it's a $65 million use of cash. Any details around that would be helpful?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, it's largely because of the sale of Diversey. As I noted, we are heavy in our free cash flow generation in the second half of the year and that is very true for Diversey. Actually, the bulk of their free cash flow is generated within Q4. So, most of the delta from the guidance that we provided before to the update for working capital and other is largely driven because of the current planned close date for the transaction in early September.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "And also, your question about the restructuring, just to make sure we have clarity there, we had previously guided $85 million to $100 million in restructuring for 2017. As you see, we now have restructuring for continuing operations excluding anything associated with the separation at $50 million and you also see, as we highlighted in the deck, that we have $50 million identified for restructuring associated with addressing stranded costs. So, those two together, we are still within our $85 million to $100 million for 2017, although on the high end. We expect that the $50 million for the restructuring associated with stranded cost, that will actually spread mostly from Q4 and then into 2018 as we address those stranded costs.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is open.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just so we all are on the same page, can you bridge the $825 million EBITDA guidance for continuing operations versus the number you had before, like last year at the end of the fourth quarter, which I believe was closer to $860 million, $865 million. I mean, you've talked about the stranded costs, but you lowered the negative impact from currency. Like what's like the delta? Like what got worse versus what you were looking at, at the end of last year?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, actually, we wouldn't say that there's a lot worse than at the end of last year. We've highlighted that some of the mix with Product Care, and Jerome can comment more on that, just as we continue to grow at a faster rate within our e-Commence and fulfillment does have some impact, however, we're seeing nice performance from Food Care and from Product Care top line, and unallocated costs of $25 million also was key in that bridge as well.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So there is something that you need to understand is the SEC rules with regards to unallocated costs before closing. And unless a given unallocated cost is very precisely put into a division, call it computers and cell phones, there is a cost for computers and cell phone for example which is very clearly set into the Diversey operation. But if it is a cost which is allocated as a percentage of sales or things like this, before closing, all of those costs move to Sealed Air to new Sealed Air, and that is probably part of this explanation and we have talked about $25 million of those costs, which in fact are moved to \u2013 into our accounting, since they're new to their accounting, and you're going to have \u2013 you're going to see those after closing being offset by GSAs (31:48).", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And one last one. In terms of like Product Care, so how do you address the margin issue where e-Commerce sales no doubt are growing, but they tend to have lower margins in industrial sales, which are declining, and so how do you make up for that margin?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So that's a very good question. We don't have a margin issue as you said, with Product Care because actually we're really very happy with the restoration of margin in that division that we have carried throughout the years. But what you have seen is that we have actually \u2013 what we have not seen, but what we have had is somewhat flat pricing, but a negative price/mix and you have seen that for the year we said that we're going to have 3% to 4% constant dollar sales growth.", "The reality in the gross profit line is that we're seeing a slight degradation in the first quarter and it's going to be impacting also the second quarter because we have had hefty resin price increases, which we have not been able to immediately offset with our own price increases, which we have started. So we already are seeing some price increase \u2013 slight price increase in the first quarter which is going to continue in the second quarter but that's one part. One part is the slight margin compression that all of our competitors have had in food packaging and in product packaging and things like this because of the speed and how hefty those resin cost increases have been.", "The second thing is the mix. And in Product Care, we are growing as we already told you in the previous quarters, much faster in e-Commerce and fulfillment than in our industrial packaging. By the way, our industrial packaging is doing much better than it has done. We are seeing some lift, we're seeing some restoration of volume which is very pleasant to see in an industrial GDP, which is still not very good, but we're seeing this.", "But what is important to understand is that yes we do have some lower value-added products temporarily in e-Commerce, but we also have and you need to remember that, have launched an equipment line. Two years ago, we didn't have any equipment product. We have at Pack Expo last October shown our new line of equipments and those are starting to ramp up. You can imagine that when your production starts to ramp up, you have lower margins because you'll have to absorb volume variances in your plants and we are by far not at the margins we need to be in our equipment. But this is the nature of the beast. You ramp up your equipment and when those are going to start kicking with sizeable volume and we're doing \u2013 we have a lot of momentum in that sector. We are going to improve our margin. This is why and I'm concluding with this, this is why I said that short-term our margins in e-Commerce 3PL are lower than our total margin, but this is not going to be the case over time.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, can we take the next \u2013 Thanks, Edlain. Operator, can we take the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi everyone, good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Hi George.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Appreciate all the details. I want to come back to the question of performance relative to guidance, if we \u2013 and let's take it from a prior, pre-Diversey being discontinued operations basis, which will then get away from that accounting as you were talking about, Jerome. So I think prior guidance you were looking for about a $1.180 billion in EBITDA and if I talk the $825 million of continuing operations and I gross up the $215 million for full year, I'll wind up at around $1.150 billion. We also have currency which seems like it's been less negative, which is a good thing and volume trends have been at least as good it would appear as you would have been expecting. So if you agree with the premise of everything I just set up, there does appear to be some difference in what you were guiding to in terms of what you are seeing right now, what would cause that?", "And then my second question and then I will turn it over. Jerome, you have done a great job of driving margin in part by getting fair value for your products in the market relative to what they are to their customers, do you feel you have much more upside in that regard either in Product Care or Food Care in terms of again getting that fair value, that fair price for the value project customers or if you largely accomplished that at this juncture. Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, George one thing to note, I'm not sure because we don't breakout guidance for each of these segments and businesses and depending on what the assumption was for hygiene, that could potentially be contributing to some of the disconnect. We did provide on slide 16 of the deck what hygiene's performance was for the full-year 2016, as well as for Q1. We have had growth within the hygiene business year-over-year for 2017. And so depending on your assumptions for that, that could be causing part of the disconnect with the guidance, looking back at it. The other thing...", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "But Carol, presumably that would be in the $1.180 billion?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yes.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, please go ahead. I apologize.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "No, I'm sorry, George, okay. So if you are looking at the total \u2013 the other thing is on some of the formula pricing in that pass through, we did have slightly higher than expected increases that we will make up in the second half of the year. So, there's a little bit of that but whereas previously we have said resins would be approximately flat for the year. They will be up slightly on a full-year basis. And so \u2013 that's timing due to the pass through. So we'll see that as well.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, yeah...", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks for that.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "....in regards to our cost increases, once again, remember the cost increases, that was $0.05 in February, it was $0.03 in March, the $0.03 of April in resins has been moved to May, and we'll see if it goes through et cetera. So, yes we have been negatively impacted on the gross profit line on both divisions; one because of formula pass through, the other one because of negotiations and it is going to impact also Product Care and also Food Care in the second quarter before we see a restoration. But what you have to be sensitive also with regards to the currency, and yes indeed, the currency impact is less, but remember who it affects most. It is the Diversey side because they have a higher exposure to non-U.S. dollar than the rest of new Sealed Air.", "Having said that, no, we don't see a deterioration of our forecast when you compare apples-with-apples. We expect continued gross profit squeeze in the second quarter because of the reasons that I talked to you about.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And on the March to get fair value for all your products, Jerome? Thank you.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "On the second comment, which is also a very good question, remember what I said several years ago, there is a catch-up to do. So, therefore, the margin increase is going to slow except for the new products and you remember that in Food Care and in Product Care, we have been moving with innovation which is \u2013 which are really doing well. We are going to update you all during our Analyst Day next autumn about this. And as a result of that we believe that we are going to be able to continue to have margin expansion. The solutions that we are bringing, adding new value to customers have a very quick and very strong payback for our customers. So, we're really pleased with our innovation.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, can we go to the next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I had a follow-up on a couple of George's questions because I've got a very similar math to him on the RemainCo, if you want to call it that, EBITDA guidance of $825 million. Maybe to just ask a little bit more straightforward, are you seeing a reduction in your EBITDA guidance for the Food Care, Product care, RemainCo business and if not, maybe you just built in some conservatism into that forecast on a go-forward basis given all the moving parts?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, our forecast is our forecast. What we have seen, as I said before, is margins squeezed in the Product Care. We used to see the sales growth move into the EBITDA and more and we are not seeing this in Product Care for the reasons I have talked about. And therefore for the full year, we're not seeing and we're not expecting to have product care have the sales growth dropped to the bottom line and more. And the reasons once again are hefty and quick resin increases and the product mix with regards to our equipment in our lower value-add products into the e-Commerce. So that's one.", "The second one is that we are \u2013 in Food Care, we're seeing growth and we're satisfied with what's going on in there, and we're not seeing the major EBITDA contraction or lower growth than you were expecting. Once again, remember what I said before, the ATC (43:59) accounting principles oblige us to take all of those non-directly attributable allocated costs that we have before closing into Diversey. They have to come to new Sealed Air that is having an impact.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And just a follow-up on the resin price increases on Food Care, I thought I heard you say \u2013 I'm sorry, Product Care. I thought I heard you say pricing was impacted by some negotiations and then in Food Care anything that you can do to maybe tighten the pass through on those resin price increases. I think, you said you weren't going to get it back until the second half of the year? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So now you don't tighten because those pass-throughs because those are contracts and therefore you respect the contracts. But what goes around comes around and as a result this at the point in time, we're going to start to benefit from those and we believe that this is going to be towards the end of the year and definitely into next year.", "With regards to Product Care, those are negotiations because we don't have basically formulas and that has affected some gross profits in the first quarter because of the speed of those $0.05 and $0.03 and potentially some more to come. We have announced price increases on \u2013 and we have executed on price increases based on resins. We also had some benzene and MDI, very hefty price cost increases, and we have already started to implement price increases on our \u2013 Instapak product line which is important.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Scott. Does that cover it?", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "It does. Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Great. Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning, thanks, guys. I just wanted to go back to the plan going forward. So, we'll be losing the Diversey EBITDA, you talked about share buyback and an accelerated share repurchase program and some debt pay down and M&A. Maybe you can just help us understand how you bridge the dilution? Because we're getting quite a bit of that in expenses (46:24). How do you see that bridge playing out over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, on the dilution, I made the comment that we would cover part of it through the net proceeds, approximately if we utilize $1.1 billion and then we utilize free cash flow generation, it's approximately $1.8 billion depending on the price of the stock, to get us to a net neutral position for the separation of the Diversey business. And we will put in place open market purchases as well as an accelerated share repurchase program, and our goal again is to neutralize by the end of 2018.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And what about M&A. I imagine that some proceeds could be used in that. Is that correct and what are you seeing in the pipeline if so? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, yes, M&A can be part of the game. I've been very public saying that we have been doing technology bolt-ons in the past and we're going to continue looking at bolt-on operations. So therefore there is no huge M&A being discussed or being looked at at this point in time. We believe that we can do a regional bolt-on to reinforce our Product Care and our Food Care divisions.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to zero-in on the corporate expense line for a minute. Lot of moving pieces there. As I understand it, I guess you had $25 million of unallocated expenses in there. I think you made some comments that $23 million of that would get covered by some transition service agreements once the sale closes and then eventually you hope to take out half of the $40 million of stranded costs, so is it right way to think of it as a negative $130 million this year going to something like a negative $110 million next year? And I know that's not all corporate, there's some spending on growth initiatives in there. Any thoughts on changing the cadence of some of that spending and maybe pushing it out a little bit to offset some of the dilution from the sale and some of the impact from the stranded costs.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, you are thinking about the math the correct way, so the $130 million includes the $25 million of unallocated, and not to delve into technical Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, but just to note that all those costs are, they are shift from discontinued to continuing operations, because the accounting rules are very specific, that unless something can be identified as a discrete cost, it can't sit in discontinued operations. So we have to pull it up into continuing operations, that's why we've called it out. That will be the easiest part of the cost to exit. They will firstly largely be covered by approximately $23 million in transition service agreement proceeds, over those agreements they vary across all of the work stream, some last 6 months, some are 12, some can go up to 18 months, that they should largely cover that $25 million.", "Then in addition to that, I highlighted the $40 million, which we will work to exit 50% of that, beginning at the close date and estimate it will probably take approximately 24 months to exit those costs. And we have included in that $50 million in the restructuring to get to the net proceeds for the sale of the business to cover the exit of those costs.", "If we don't have the growth to be able to cover that $20 million, that we're saying, we're not exiting, obviously we will have to take actions to address more than the $20 million, because our goal is to continue to have quality of earnings via EBITDA growth as we see top-line growth. It always doesn't happen smoothly one-for-one depending on, if we're growing in a certain sector and making investments such as with the e-Commerce and fulfillment markets where we're growing rapidly there, but we do plan to have year-over-year.", "Also, if we look at either our corporate expenses or what we're investing within the businesses, Jerome has created a culture here, it is still there, and we will continue to manage that way. We have to earn the right to grow, and earn the right to be able to spend and invest. And it's at the performance of the business level or in total for the company. If we're not seeing that growth and that improvement in performance, we will very aggressively manage the cost.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Having said that, you have observed I hope the dramatic shift in our volume growth. And that helps me to come back and say and remind all of what I said last year. Last year, I said that we were expecting to have a total growth of about 3%, which we did not deliver, but I was expecting this to be \u2013 the growth of last year to be ramping up towards the end of the year. So, when you step back what are you seeing? You're seeing that basically I was wrong by one to two quarters maximum, and I do confirm that I am expecting to see the volume growth and the total growth to firm up because we said 3% to 4% this year, and when you look at specifically to the volume, we have had this past quarter, about the double growth that we have had for a long time because our volume growth in New Sealed Air has been of about 0.8% to 0.7% in the first three quarters of last year, and about 2% in the fourth quarter, so what you're seeing that this growth has picked up. So, Q4 volume growth for New Sealed Air was 2%. Q1 volume growth for the first quarter was 3.8% and I do confirm that this is a very good and positive trend, which is making me very confident that our strategy was and is the right one, innovation and segmentation is the name of the game. And next to that we're going to see how it develops into 2018, but altogether we believe that this 3% to 4% growth in 2017 is going to be coming, which is the major change compared to the past.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. Thanks for that. I think no one disputes the volume growth. I think it's just some of the translation of that to the bottom-line getting offset by some of the OpEx spending and the corporate has been just a little bit frustrating, so hoping to see a little bit more of that drop to the bottom line going forward. Just one on the Food Care...", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Not more frustrating than for us by the way, but this is a transition time. It is a difficult time in 2017. We have done what we felt was necessary to be done for the future of Sealed Air. This Diversey has earned the right to fly from its own wings with Bain Capital right now, and I think this is good for Sealed Air and that this is good for Diversey. And on the Product Care, having the sales growth not dropping to the bottom line, fully agree with you, we believe that this is transitional also, but it's going to be there in 2017.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Appreciate that. I just had one on Food Care and that was the price/mix was down, even the resins are up and I think the U.S. was a bigger contributor to the mix, but I thought they would have had a higher price point. Just wondering are you seeing any competition pick up there that's leading you to have to cut any like versus like pricing above and beyond just the raw pass-throughs and may be just help us understand what was driving the price/mix to be down there?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "I'm a very strong believer that you do not buy your way into markets with price, and I have proven that over the past few years. What is making us win in the marketplace is our innovation, it is not only on red fresh meat, it is also on cheese, it is also on processed foods, we have customers who are converting to Grip & Tear solutions, we are making progress with OptiDure as we were expecting, we're making progress with our DOT as we were expecting.", "So I would say all good and this is what enables us to have the volume moves that we're having. Mostly what we're seeing is, price in the first quarter mostly North America because of the formula pricing. It's mostly a timing point situation.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, I think we have time for one or two more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol just a two-part question on the dilution. So, if your buyback call it $1.8 billion, let's call it 40 million shares, so the $1.70 just by my math would go $2.15. So to get back to $2.60 would seem to require quite a bit of EBITDA growth. I'm just wondering how much of that would come from the stranded cost/unallocated cost going away? How much needs to go to get to neutral on earnings by the end of next year? That's my first question.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, we would assume again that all of the unallocated is addressed by the end of 2018, so that full 25 million. And the 20 million of the 40 million, we would address that beginning at the date of separation and estimate that it will take approximately 24 months, cost will exit each and every quarter. And the timing of that length to be variable. But our assumptions and assume that we would exit the 25 million plus the 20 million within 24 months of the close, but the biggest portion of it being exited by the end of 2018.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And are you assuming organic growth on top of that growth?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yes, we are assuming organic growth for EBITDA.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And just last question on the buyback, Carol. Can you just talk about the timing of it and the extent to which you intend to lever up to buy back stock before the deal closes? Thank you very much.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yeah. So, Adam, we'll be out of our blackout now that we've had our earnings release and shared this information. We'll file our 10-Q by tomorrow at the latest, so which we'll just have all the numbers that we've presented within our earnings release. So we'll be out of the blackout, so we can be back in the market at any time, prior to going back into blackout for the Q2 earnings and we'll have to put plans in place before that to be active through that entire time period and up until the earnings release for Q2. So, we internally we've talked about what numbers make sense, as always we'll stick to the discipline we've had where we run models, we look at an intrinsic value for the stock, we review the models with the board and those ranges and we'll continue to do so as we go forward. We ended Q1 right around 3.5 times leverage, we will stick to our commitment of 3.5 times to 4 times leverage and we feel very comfortable with the amount that we will be buying in Q2 and Q3 even without a close of the Diversey transaction. While we don't see any risk to the transaction at all, we will be very prudent in how we buy the stock back.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you, Carol.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator?", "Operator", "Yes, ma'am.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "That ends our call for today, please.

Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2017 Sealed Air Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please begin.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.", "Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov.", "We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Included in today's presentation on slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half, and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program.", "And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition, presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top-line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution.", "In Product Care, our stated strategy to disproportionally grow our e-Commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it to automated fulfillment solutions that will over time give us equivalent margins to our industrial business.", "In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated, case-ready application that align with protein processes' productivity imperatives, and retailers' and consumers' demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. We are making the right investment and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth.", "During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy and 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives. In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3% and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heel of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010.", "Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased freight surcharges. In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of olefins, nylon, MDI and paper, and the price increases that we announced in the spring did not produce the yields that we were expecting; therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1.", "Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-Commerce and fulfillment operations. With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half and the pipeline continues to expand globally.", "In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary case-ready solutions and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil.", "And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin costs, which takes time to recover given our formula of pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formulas late in the second quarter.", "But for 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objectives and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solutions, as well as our price and cost actions.", "With regards to our Diversey. Our sales to Diversey to Bain is on track to close and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call and through August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $285 million using the combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program.", "We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program and once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases, targeted M&A opportunities and as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debts.", "Let me now turn to slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars.", "Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. And Food Care sales in EMEA declined 1% year-over-year, as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain, were offset by weakness in the UK, Russia and Germany.", "Product Care was down 2%, primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the UK. Excluding these rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA would have been down less than 1%, and this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report an year-over-year impact from rationalization.", "Asia Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market down cycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC, led by 15% growth in Japan, and 11% in China.", "In Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars, Food Care was badly hit by Brazil, and to a lesser extent the economic weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LatAm with 9% growth.", "Turning to slide 6, which highlights volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. You can see that this slide \u2013 from this slide, that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter, led by 9% volume growth in North America.", "Price/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, North America delivered a favorable price/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization on product mix in EMEA.", "And now let's turn to slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative price/mix and price/cost spread.", "Strength in North America was driven by improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rate and the adoption of case-ready applications across all protein. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region, yet at a slightly more moderated pace.", "Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started its increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%. EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales was essentially flat compared with last year as it follows a tough first quarter. Food Care equipment sales returned to growth one quarter earlier than anticipated and I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Market penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and ovenables, which continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half.", "APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Beef production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading to the second half, however, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018.", "Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 75% of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars, as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LatAm as a region with significant growth potential, and as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable, high-value solutions and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit packaged solutions, and extends our reach into several new market segments.", "For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, largely due to timing of our raw materials cost pass through.", "Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see in the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price cost spread.", "North America and EMEA accounts from approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-Commerce and fulfillment are our fastest growing sectors in both of these regions and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with the industrial segments.", "Sales in APAC were up 10% in constant dollars led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing increased demand for our differentiated solutions portfolio including Fill-Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region, and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth.", "For the full-year 2017, we continue to anticipate top-line sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost.", "Let me now pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Jerome. Let's turn to slides 9 and 10 which provide the sales and EBITDA bridges for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our sales trends in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis.", "Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017, as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016.", "Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.", "On slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.", "On slide 11, free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the six months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million and restructuring costs were $33 million.", "Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which $33 million relates to a cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax-efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our growth to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million.", "Turning to our outlook on slide 12, we are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumed increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% in Product Care. We expect our top-line performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million.", "Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations.", "Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full-year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70.", "Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full-year effect of share repurchases through August 1. Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full-year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.", "Turning to slide 13, we will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full-year 2017 outlook from continuing operations plus $215 million from the first eight months of discontinued operations, assuming a September close.", "We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million.", "Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017, and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate.", "Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.", "This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8.", "With that, Operator, can you please open the call for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you all doing?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good. How are you, Mehul?", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. Why do you think the previous price increase didn't yield the amount it should have, and I guess what gives you confidence on your September 1 price increase that you've recently implemented?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Very good question. You can go and say competitive forces et cetera. I think that the more important thing was the importance of the price increases. We tend to talk about polyethylene, which year-to-date went up 7%. We are not so much open on the price increases on nylon, which were very, very hefty between the fourth quarter last year and now. About MDI for our polyurethane foams, which has doubled in China, for example, in the period of 12 months, and paper and for example corrugated OCC went up 79% since July of last year. So that was very hefty, very big. We tried to pass important price increases and some of that got passed, but not enough. So, this is not very different than what happens from time-to-time. We had that three years ago where we had to go back with this. We're going back and we are just going to execute that on September 1.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Jerome. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, everyone. I hope you can hear me well.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yes, George. Good morning.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Congratulations on the progress. I just wanted to piggyback on the question of pricing and margin conversion. So, Jerome, is it fair to say that in your view the pricing efforts, maybe not being where you had expected them to be, was more a function of \u2013 in terms of their conversion to margin, the pace of the increase in input costs, or in fact was it more competitive activity?", "And as you looked overall at the quarter, you had very strong volume growth in North America, congratulations on that. We would have expected more conversion in margin. What were the keys in terms of margin conversion relative to volume? Was it really the pace of inputs? Was it competition? What would you single out? Thank you very much and good luck in the quarter.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, George. All in all, actually, I'm really happy with what's going on. We had a strategy, which is about differentiating our self from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. This is clearly ongoing because, actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we'll have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New products introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends which are very, very different from what you have seen in the industry.", "And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing and that we are passing our cost increases and this is something that we know how to do. And when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition, it is about the execution on our strategy, some tactical things. And if we don't get it right, right away, we just come back.", "The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong and our orders book is very strong. This is going to happen later in this year and this is also going to continue next year.", "And what we're seeing there is that the \u2013 it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation and newer and more performing equipment.", "This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So, what you're seeing is our customer investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh on Tray. It can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but his is a very strong trend.", "What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a tremendous evolution of our portfolio and our segments there. E-commerce and 3PL is here to grow. It is for us a very important segment and we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world. And we're placing equipment in Japan. You saw a tremendous growth in China, in North America. The orders book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something, which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio.", "Short term, the numbers I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper. MDI, 30% up in Europe, 2x in China versus same time last year.", "Nylon doubling and things like this, almost, I think that our short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "George, is there a follow up.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "No. We got two parts there. I appreciate it.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Your line is open.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you very much. Good morning to all.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "A quick one on Product Care. I mean, you've talked in the past, and I think you mentioned that today, shorter term, like lower margins in e-Commerce and 3PL versus the segment margin. How quickly you believe you can close that gap?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, the pace is going to depend on our placement of new equipment and our reducing manufacturing cost of those equipment as we produced \u2013 as we go to mass production. There is a trend in e-Commerce and this trend is that corrugated cardboard prices are going up dramatically. And that as a result of that you are going to see more and more pouchers, which are enabling lower dimension and weight costing for shipping and lower cost of packaging.", "This is a trend, we have two very strong offering here. For boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improve dimensional weight costing. And our StealthWrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at Pack Expo later in the year are tremendous substitute for boxes.", "So, we have a huge momentum in e-Commerce 3PL, and this is, therefore, accelerating our sales growth in Product Care. Yes we are because of the cost increases, we are having a slightly lower margins. But as I said, we're dealing with those.", "So, how quickly? We're going to show you during our Investor Day week of December 4, we're going to show you our three-year targets and plan, and you will see that what I said earlier in my prepared remarks, with regards to margin in that segment, you will see that we intend to recoup and have similar margins than in the rest of the portfolio over the next three years.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citibank. Your line is open.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Just following up on the previous question. The $20 million EBITDA hit you saw in the quarter from mix and price/cost spread, is it possible at all to say, roughly, what portion of that was mix shift and what portion is price/cost that, I guess, at some point, you might get recovered?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, we don't break out between mix and price/cost spread. It's a combination of both, Anthony. But, we do expect, as Jerome has highlighted, to see improvement sequentially in our EBITDA growth as we move through the balance of the year. And we started to see the turn from the formula pricing for Food Care at the end of the second quarter, and will expect to have positive trends from that, obviously depending on how resins play out for the second half of the year and the price increases being implemented for the Product Care division will also favorably impact our improvement sequentially in our EBITDA margins as well as our overall EBITDA growth.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "We are in a specialty business. You don't shovel your price increase on to your customers. You collaboratively work to introduce those solutions and at the very same time you have to pass your costs. We understand that, and it's just a question of time.", "It would have been faster if those cost increases would not have been that important. So, have we absorbed a little bit of those? Yes, we have. But our customers know that we are passing them. This is why we have announced our September 1 price increase, and this is \u2013 we have announced those in North America. We have announced those in Europe. So, it's ongoing.", "In the end, we have a lot of momentum with our customers because they know that in both of those divisions, we are the innovator, and this is what allows us to work collaboratively, positively with them.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Anthony, do you have a follow-up question?", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "No. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator, next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thanks. Thanks for all the detail. Congrats on the progress here, so especially on the volume side. Just trying to understand the guidance for the rest of 2017. So, you increased the EBITDA range to $825 million to $835 million from $825 million, but you also lower the FX headwind to zero from $5 million. You had other lower costs as well in Q2. I'm just trying to understand, is the guidance bump from the lower FX headwind and lower stranded costs? Or are you actually more confident in the Food Care and Product Care segments?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, what you're seeing is that there are few bubbles in the air right now. The FX is more favorable than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Where is it going to be three or four months from now, I don't know. Just picked the euro. In January, the euro was at $1.03. It is at $1.18 today. And nobody would have thought in January that it would be at $1.18 today. So, I'm not going to go and anticipate, but at this point in time, there is a positive bubble in the air, which is related to currency and that's one thing we have as a possible positive.", "As a possible negative, we're a little bit concerned with polyethylene prices. We were anticipating that they were going to start to come down in September. And right now, we have some producers who are already just talking about price increases on the heels of possible hurricane. I mean, this is the most fun thing that you can hear, but there's a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not happen. They've been announced for \u2013 they've been pushed to August. And then, you have some more announcement, which have been done for September. So, you've got some of those games going on right now.", "But we are a bit concerned that as a potential negative, we would not have what we were expecting in terms of raw materials on polyethylene for September to December. So, that's why we're seeing that. And next to that, we're very determined to get our price increase through and we might suffer a little bit from volume in some more commoditized segments in there. So, that's what we're doing.", "Overall, these are short-term tailwinds or headwinds, very short term. We believe that our fourth quarter is going to be very strong and the most important thing is to see that this Change the Game, which was in doubt in 2016 that we were believing was coming, is definitely coming. This is why we're having that growth momentum right now, which we didn't have in 2016 and which in general, the industry doesn't have.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question. Go ahead, Arun. Sorry about that. Go ahead. Operator, can you open up back the line or we'll bring him back after? Do you want to go to the next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning, Adam.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Jerome, two questions. First is just aside from paying down debt and buying back shares to offset the dilution once the deal closes, what is your just overarching strategic plan for the new company? Do you eventually plan to grow by acquisition, or what exactly do you have in mind? Obviously, EBITDA over the last eight quarters or so has been kind of flat to down. It's just been hard to generate organic EBITDA growth. So, what do you have in mind longer term post the deal closing?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, we did not have growth in 2016, sales growth, and therefore, EBITDA. We are in transition, and we said that several years ago. There was a Get Fit and there was a Change the Game. It is very important to understand who we are. We're not a simple packaging company.", "We are solutions driven, and our margins will expand as we expand the value of our solutions to our customers. That is very clear, and there is a fundamental mega trend in the way we're working with our customers. They respond, we are the very big player in the sectors of protein and in the sector of protective packaging through our solutions.", "We are \u2013 that is where we're going. So, we're not going to only buy back share and pay down debt. We are starting to look at some potential acquisition targets, multiples are very high, generally speaking, acquisitions do not return shareholder value, traditionally or most of them don't, or the vast majority of acquisitions do not generate shareholder value in general, and when you look at the multiples right now, you have to be careful. This Deltaplam, very small acquisition, is a very good example of a small acquisition in a given country where we do believe that there is potential. It was the right time, at the right price with the right equipment and technology. They have fabulous equipment and that is going to be a very nice little acquisition. We are looking at some others.", "At the very same time, you have to understand that we've been very, very busy with the separation of Diversey. Therefore, we're not going to rush into things right away. We are working diligently and with discipline on the next step. But, yeah, we are going to be doing acquisitions over time.", "Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, Jerome. And just one follow-up. You talked about acquisition multiples being quite high. I know you're buying back your stock just to offset dilution. But you guys are, call it, at 12 times, 13 times EBITDA once you get the proceeds. I mean, do you think your stock is undervalued here? And if so, can you explain why you think that?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Well, you're not going to take me there. Do I personally think our stock is undervalued? Well, looking at the Investor Day as it is coming in our numbers, so you will judge in December whether you think that our stock is overvalued or undervalued. I have my own opinion on those kind of things.", "We are determined to become a value-add company to our customers with new solutions. We happen to invoice packaging, but our number one asset is to add value to our customers because of longer shelf life, because of the very differentiated equipment that we're bringing and with regards to protective and the e-Commerce and industrial, the dim weight cost increases are important and they become \u2013 as e-Commerce is growing very rapidly, you are seeing the absolute need of optimizing e-Commerce packaging and we are in a tremendous position to do that. So, we are specialty of specialty. This is the way you are going to see us over time.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Good morning, thank you. Could you just I guess talk a little bit about the type of volumes that you are seeing on the industrial side of Product Care. I mean, are you seeing growth there or is it really mostly from the e-Commerce and fulfillment?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "We're seeing growth in industrial sector. I'm not going to tell you that we're seeing huge growth, but it has bottomed last year, and it is the second quarter where we're seeing some dollars and volume growth, we'd call that in the range of 2%, 2.5%, which is quite good. Not everywhere. It is country-by-country, but we're seeing, in China we're seeing industrial growth, in some West European countries we're seeing industrial growth, in the U.S. we're seeing a little bit of industrial growth, in the UK, we're not. So really, you read the GDP and you see what's going on, but we're doing quite well there.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Tyler, do you have a follow-up?", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Yeah. I guess, Carol, just on the corporate expense. I think the previous targets were to get rid of the $40 million of stranded costs, eliminate 50% in two years. And then, on the unallocated was to eliminate by 2018. I guess, those unallocated a little bit lower. But has anything sort of materially changed with those targets?", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "No. We're still on track for that. The $20 million unallocated that was revised down from $25 million should not have any negative impact on 2018. We are already starting activities to address the unallocated as well as stranded costs. So, we're confident that we'll be able to stay on plan, if not outperform what's been previously communicated.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of (48:11). Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. Good morning.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good morning.", "Unknown Speaker", "I just wanted to go back to Brazil. Did we actually get the volume decline or can you just give us a little more flavor on what happened in the quarter in Brazil? And then, secondly, I think you were embedding some recovery in the second half for Brazil, is that still the case? And if so, some idea of how much?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, in Brazil, you could see if you look at the detail, the charcoal consumption went down 11% in the second quarter and that local meat consumption is down about 20% in the second quarter as a result of the inspection scandal saga and the related items in the production of fresh red meat.", "This has been much \u2013 the impact has been much bigger than anyone could anticipate. The exports have been impacted also. Our view is that this is temporary. We're seeing that it's stabilizing. We're seeing that you have equipment being sold and placed and ordered by red meat producers.", "And we are \u2013 I was in Brazil three weeks ago and just talking to all of those customers and they believe that the slowed rates are going to start to increase sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So, this is not a long-term trend. This is specific to Brazil given the scandals that have happened.", "Then you look at Argentina. And Argentina is seeing its consumption go up by 2%, which is very little. And you see the exports going up nicely at increasing in year-to-date by 38% except that Argentina is not a big meat exporter anymore, it is the number 17 meat exporter. It is the 17th largest exporter of meat and much smaller than it was a decade ago. That is for Argentina and Brazil.", "We're seeing some positives in other countries. Very strong business in Mexico where we have extraordinary position. I was there last week. I can assure you that the trends are very, very positive there. We think nice trends in the second quarter in Chile for fish production where we participate very nicely there.", "So, all in all, total Latin America is negative as a result of the weight of Brazil, but we believe that this is temporary.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Just had two questions. One following-up on the last one. Just wondering if you could parse out, if any, of the strength in the non-Brazil Food Care business you think might have been benefiting from some of the reduced exports out of Brazil? Is some of that had to come from other regions?", "And then, as a second question, Jerome, just wondering if you could comment on the e-Commerce margins, been weak for a couple of quarters and I think a couple of people were alluding to it, but just wondering how you see the margins on some of the new product offerings? Can they be in that 20%-plus range that you've been in, in the past once they start to get a little bit more scale and maturity? Thanks.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, starting with the export, yes, the U.S. is dramatically benefiting from beef exports. You saw what happened in the first quarter. If I remember well, the April exports were at over 30% growth out of the U.S. So, what Brazil did not export and given the negative cycle in Australia, the U.S. has been a huge winner in this. And you are seeing right now that prices of U.S. beef are very high, but these did not affect the exports, and exports have been freshened and frozen, and cooked beef for the month of June have been almost 12% higher than a year ago. So, this is very strong. It's positive also for us because all of that is packed with our bags, and we are really happy going to see what's going on there.", "With regards to e-Commerce, yes, we have a product mix, very nice. We have segment mix, which at this point in time is negative. We made no mystery about that already last year. What we were not seeing is the growth that we think. What you have to understand is that we having position, we're building new business with our customers and what I talked about last quarter is something that is happening, which is that it takes time to go and sell equipment.", "It is a capital spending for our customers. This is not a consumable. So, on one side, you have margin squeeze a little bit to the very strong and steep increases of raw materials, paper, polyethylene, nylon et cetera which are ingredients, which are raw materials for our mailers, for our phones, for our bubble wrap et cetera.", "But we're going to get over that. And next to that you have this capital equipment. The very strong sign is that our sales of equipment in Product Care year-to-date are up 10% compared to last year knowing that we have some StealthWrap and FloWrap and also made its core view which were equipment were prototypes shown at Pack Expo last year. We're seeing a very nice momentum in there that's going to accelerate. So, we're producing a few of those machines. And when that accelerates also, we're going to see margin expansion.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, we have time for one more question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "I think it would be helpful to better understand your intended pace of share repurchases versus other uses of capital. Following the completion of the Diversey Care divestiture, should we expect to see a larger purchase in September? Are there any limitations on repurchasing shares in 2017 aside from the size of your share repurchase program? And I think you touched on this, but how do you think about the trade-offs of mitigating near-term dilution through share repurchases versus creating shareholder values through other uses of capital? Thank you.", "Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.", "So, Jason, I'll start and then Jerome may want to address the very last part of your question. But there's nothing that would restrict us from being very active in the market following the close of the Diversey transaction. We have communicated previously that it is our intent to address the dilution. It will take some time. It won't all be done by the end of 2017 and addressing that dilution includes not only the share buyback, but also improvement in our EBITDA as we move forward.", "So, we do plan to be active in the market. We plan to continue to use a combination of tools such as OMR as well as the ASR as we move forward. We modeled the share price based on our strategic plans and working with the board, set levels of that share price that we feel is the fair value for that share buyback.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "And I made comments earlier about our discipline. In the years to come, we are going to be bigger through acquisitions also. We're not going to rush into it. We're going to make sure that we add shareholder value.", "This is a fundamental approach of this management team and we pursue innovation and strategy execution along the lines that we have already announced. You are going to see during Investor Day early December, how disciplined we are and the importance of this innovation. These are going to be complemented by regional bolt-ons in very strategic places where we believe that we can add tremendous value to deploy our technology.", "You are going to also see over time that we are going to reinforce those two divisions, and be very focused in making sure that we are the specialty of the specialty company that we say we are becoming, and that we have already announced that we are going to become as a result of our Change the Game (58:02)", "We are not seeing ourselves as a just simple normal packaging company. We are solutions-driven, oriented there. Our automation is a big part of our offering with the razor/razor blade and you're going to see more of that as the years are coming.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, that concludes our call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am?", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.", "I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.", "Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov.", "We will also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Included in today's presentation on slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complements some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, President and CEO. Jerome?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. On our call today, we will cover our third quarter results, outlook for the year-end, and provide an update on our capital allocation strategy, post the close of the Diversey sale.", "You will have also the opportunity to hear from Ted Doheny who will be taking over as CEO from me on January 1, and Bill Stiehl, our acting Chief Financial Officer. But before all and relevant to my retirement, I take this opportunity to let you know that I ran my first marathon in New York last Sunday, thanks to my son, Alexi (02: 47) and my friend, Allen (02: 48). For those of you who are up to the challenge, you will be rewarded for life. But don't worry I will not turn into Forrest Gump in my retirement.", "Back to business, you can see that in the third quarter net sales growth accelerated to 6% on an as reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%.", "Our performance in the third quarter continued to improve compared to the first half of the year when we delivered 3% constant dollar top line growth and 18% margin and this momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter and we are delivering on our 2017 outlook as a result of our highest sales in our pricing and cost disciplines.", "In fact, we are executing on our long-term profitable growth strategy that we outlined at the Analyst Day in June 2015. Remember, at that time we set a 3-year sales growth target of 4% to 5% for each of those two divisions. We said that we expected sales growth to accelerate throughout the period of 2016 to 2018 and that these growth would be led by volume, thanks to our market maker innovative strategy. In 2016, we didn't see much movement on the top line and exited the year with an increase of just 1% constant dollar sales growth.", "However, our growth have been improving each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of last year, we started delivering in constant currency 1% sales growth. In the first quarter of this year, in constant dollars, we delivered 3% growth. In the second quarter, we delivered 4% growth, and now in the third quarter, we are reporting 5% constant currency sales growth. And should the temporary and incredibly steep PE resin cost increases of 13%, or $0.10 per pound since August and $0.15 year-to-date, not have surprised all of our industry, those sales gain would have translated into the bottom line already.", "The good news is that I said temporary cost increases. And also that we have fully implemented our announced Product Care and Food Care price increases on September 1 and October 1 respectively. This is where our confidence comes in as we head into year-end. We are seeing rapid adoption of our game changing solutions. We're seeing healthy end-market demand, particularly in North America and Asia and our now famous operational disciplines are taking hold.", "On September 6, we closed the Diversey sale. When we announced the transaction in March 2017, we increased our share repurchase program, and we said that we would pay down debt, address stranded costs, and target selective M&A that was aligned with our strategic direction. Through September 30, we repurchased approximately 15.5 million shares valued at $677 million through a combination of open market and accelerated share repurchase programs, including an ASR that is currently ongoing.", "We paid down $1.1 billion in debt, bringing our total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. We have already made progress on our cost structure and will continue to do so heading into next year. We also closed two acquisitions: a small strategic food packaging company in Brazil, Deltaplam, which closed in August and, then in October, we closed the Fagerdala acquisition, a protective packaging company based in Singapore that significantly expands our presence in Asia.", "As all of you know on September 9, I announced my retirement effective December 31, 2017. I have really enjoyed my time at Sealed Air, and I'm extremely proud of what we have become, thanks to the vision and determination of our management team and our 14,000 global employees who I want to recognize here.", "We have built a winning culture, a culture that is obsessed with creating new value for our customers. We take the responsibility of being the industry leader and the market maker by creating new markets with disruptive innovations and instilling discipline throughout the industries we serve.", "Our long-term profitable growth strategy is well under way, and we continue to gain traction globally as you could see from our sales growth focusing all of our efforts on some very key megatrends.", "Our journey as a knowledge-based company continues with many exciting opportunities ahead. And I am very confident that under Ted, Bill and the entire leadership team, the organization will continue to thrive and generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees.", "Bill joined Sealed Air in 2013 and has been on this journey alongside our senior leadership team. Ted and I continue to work closely together to ensure a seamless and successful transition. We have been spending time in Charlotte, North Carolina and now also traveling around the world with our senior team to meet with customers and employees.", "Let me now move back to our third quarter results in more detail, and turning to slide 6 where we highlight our results by region. We experienced constant dollar year-over-year growth across all regions. North America once again was our fastest-growing region at 7%, with sales up 9% in Food Care and up 4% in Product Care. Sales in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America increased in the range of 2% to 3%. I want to highlight that Product Care sales in Asia Pacific were up 15% in the third quarter, led by volume growth.", "On slide 7, you can see our volume and price mix trends by division and by region. As we anticipated, top line performance was primarily driven by 5% volume growth with positive trends across all regions. Food Care volumes were up 5% with 9% growth in North America and positive trends in both Latin America and EMEA. Product Care volumes were up 6%, driven by our largest regions, North America and EMEA, increasing 4% and 7% respectively. Overall price mix was relatively neutral to our top line results. Keep in mind that our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect as of September 1 and in Food Care for our non-formula customers effective October 1.", "And now, let's turn to slide 8 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care sales were $716 million and adjusted EBITDA was $158 million, or 22% of sales. Sales were up 4% in constant dollars compared to last year due to higher volumes. Our margin compressed year-over-year primarily due to timing of raw material cost factors and higher input costs. It is important to note, however, that sequentially EBITDA margins improved 60 basis points as formulas started to align better with higher input costs, and we continued our focus on expense management.", "Our performance in North America which accounted for 51% of Food Care sales was driven by the ongoing adoption of our case-ready platform across all protein including seafood and higher equipment sales. We capitalized on end market demand in all protein segments led by an increase in slaughter rates of more than 5% in the beef sector. We expect our business in North America to continue outpacing the market in Q4, although keep in mind, we have tougher year-over-year comparables on volume to come.", "EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales was essentially flat compared with last year. We are continuing to see adoption of our new products in an environment where the protein market is growing modestly, but this was offset by timing of equipment sales. Heading into year-end, we anticipate improving top line trends with growth coming from both equipment and new product sales.", "APAC accounted for 15% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Australia and New Zealand declined in the quarter as a result of further deterioration in the dairy market. But an encouraging data point to share is that for the first time in over a year, slaughter rates in Australia were relatively flat with prior year. The beef cycle is now near bottom, and we expect growth to return late 2018.", "Latin America represented the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 80% of Food Care sales. Constant dollar sales were up 3% led by growth in Argentina and stabilizing trends in Brazil.", "This was offset by a temporary decline in Mexico where our business was impacted by the earthquake late in the quarter. But heading into year-end, we anticipate improving trends in both Brazil and Mexico, albeit slow, with continued growth in Central America. For the full year 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales approximately 3.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin are expected to be approximately 22%.", "Slide 9 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $415 million and adjusted EBITDA was $87 million, or 21% of net sales. You can see in the EBITDA bridge that, compared to last year, higher volumes were offset by a negative mix and price/cost spread. Product Care margins improved sequentially by 100 basis points, this improvement was primarily related to higher volumes, yield on our pricing actions and cost management.", "North America and EMEA accounted for approximately 85% of Product Care sales and were up 4% and 7% respectively. APAC had another strong quarter with 15% growth led by China and Japan. Our advanced product portfolio, including inflatable I-Pack, self wrap and FloWrap, continued to gain significant traction as our e-commerce and fulfillment customers optimized and automated their distribution channels.", "In Western Europe, I want to highlight that in the third quarter, we benefited from accelerated execution of automated solutions, volume growth of our consumables after record level of equipment installs over the last 12 months and pockets of strength across some of the industrial segments. With the acquisition of Fagerdala, we tripled our manufacturing footprint in China and as you would expect, there are synergies to leverage and meaningful cross-selling opportunities.", "For the full year of 2017, we expect Product Care to increase sales approximately 6% on a constant-dollar basis which would include $20 million in sales from Fagerdala. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20%. And this implies Q4 constant dollar year-over-year growth of approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%.", "Let me now turn the call over to Bill to review our overall sales and EBITDA bridges and outlook heading into year-end. Bill?", "William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Jerome. Slides 11 and 12 provide the net sales and EBITDA bridges for Q3 and nine-months ending September 30.", "My comments will focus on slide 11 which highlights our third quarter results from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. You can see that our top line performance was primarily led by higher volumes of $55 million and favorable currency of $13 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million, or 19% of sales. Volume contributed $23 million in Q3, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $16 million. Operating expenses decreased $10 million and restructuring savings were $4 million. Currency had a favorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $3 million. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 in the third quarter compared to $0.41 in Q3 of 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations was 31%.", "On slide 12, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the nine-months ending September 30. In the EBITDA bridge, we see that higher volumes were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price/cost spread.", "Turning to slide 13. Free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the nine months ended September 30, consolidated free cash flow excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey was a source of cash of $267 million. CapEx was $127 million, cash interest payments were $153 million, and restructuring costs were $49 million, aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital, and other assets and liabilities or use of cash of $70 million.", "Turning to our outlook on slide 14. For top line, we now expect sales to be approximately $4.4 billion, an increase of 6% on an as-reported basis. Favorable FX is expected to have an impact of approximately $40 million. Constant dollar growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%, including sales from Fagerdala of $20 million. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q3; the Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.", "2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $830 million, which includes $7 million from favorable FX. Corporate expenses are now estimated to be $115 million.", "Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $185 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $160 million. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 30% for the full year 2017. Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at $1.75 to $1.80. Our adjusted EPS outlook is based on 190 million shares, which reflects the weighted-average full-year effect of share repurchases through September 30.", "Let's now turn to slide 15 and review our free cash flow outlook. As a reminder, we present free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes our outlook for continuing operations and results from discontinued operations. We continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we start with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full-year 2017 outlook from continuing operations of $830 million.", "We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs excluding efforts dedicated to reducing separation related costs are estimated to be $55 million. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $175 million, of which $155 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $20 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate.", "Working capital and other assets and liabilities is now expected to be a use of cash of approximately $40 million as compared to our previous guidance of a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.", "I would like to now pass the call over to Ted who will provide us with early insights and thoughts on our future opportunities and strategic direction. On behalf of the senior leadership team and our employees, we would like to welcome you to Sealed Air and congratulate you on your new role.", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you, Bill. As Jerome indicated, I started at Sealed Air mid-September, and my short story is that I liked the company even more looking inside than I did analyzing it from the outside. I've been traveling the world to meet with employees and customers and have also had the opportunity to visit some of our facilities including spending time with the talented team from Fagerdala in China.", "My previous experience has been with two iconic and market-leading companies in the equipment, service and solutions space. When I was approached about the opportunity with Sealed Air, I saw another iconic company that has successfully transformed over these past five years from a product- driven to market-driven company.", "As I learn more about Sealed Air, I see that we have an exciting opportunity to now move from being a leading company in the packaging industry to be the world-class company solving the most complex challenges in packaging with automated solutions. Sealed Air's reputation of being a true innovative leader within the Global Packaging segment is impressive, and our pipeline of automation in both Product Care and Food Care is creating even more opportunities to further reimagine the business and think outside the box and maybe even outside the package.", "In 2018, we'll build off our sales growth in 2017 and gain share in the markets we serve. We will execute our strategy with both sales and profit growth, as well as operational excellence that will demonstrate incremental margin improvement over 2017. We'll continue to allocate capital as we outlined with share buybacks and strategic M&A. With $1.4 billion remaining under the authorized share buyback program, we'll continue to be active in the market with open market and accelerated share repurchases.", "On M&A, we'll focus on companies that expand our market presence geographically and take our innovations to adjacent markets. We'll look for technology and automation companies that further enhance our Food Care and Product Care businesses that solve our customers' toughest packaging challenges. Our organic growth, M&A strategy, and focus on operational excellence will take our business to the next level of performance. We plan on sharing our 2018 and long-term profitable growth plans with you in the coming months, including an Investor Day later next year.", "Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to remind you our fourth quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 8.", "So, with that, Vince, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations, Jerome, not only on the retirement but the marathon. And congrats to Ted and Bill as well.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "My question was, Jerome, really if I look at \u2013 to your point, you've had the significant margin pressure related to resin prices year-to-date. So if I look at slide 12 in the deck, there's, right, $54 million of mix and price cost spread. So can you help us sort of parse that mix versus price cost spread out so that we can sort of think about this on a go-forward basis if and when resin prices start to decline?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Okay. So you -first of all, you have seen with all our competitors that everybody in the industry has been surprised by the pace of the cost increase in resin and the number. So, let me remind you, $0.15 since the beginning of the year. That's almost 20%. And $0.10 since August 1.That's about 13%. And here we're talking about PE. I'm not talking about nylon. I'm not talking about other raw materials which went up in a very steep way.", "So this is in light of us having in Food Care a sizable part of our business which is formula driven. And remember also that in the month of July and before, we were thinking, and not only us everybody was thinking, that because of the capacity addition coming onstream, prices were not going to go up. They were going to come down.", "So, yes, we did have margin squeeze. I would call it margin compression. And, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing that this is temporary, and that as a result of that, we are going to do what we have done in the last round. When resin prices went down, we are going to recoup the quality of our business. So I'm really not worried. And we are going to start seeing this, in my mind, definitely in 2018 depending on the pace again at which resins are going to be coming down.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning. I'll also add my congratulations to everybody on their new roles, including you, Jerome.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "My question is sort of really on price/mix and just sort of the lack of lift there. I guess I would have thought by now we'd start to see some of the formula-based pricing from earlier in the year when resin started to move up, kick in. Just wondering if there's some offsetting factors on there on the mix side of things. And maybe you could just comment on the overall pricing environment outside of the moves in resin. We've heard from a couple of other guys in the industry about some pricing pressure just in response to weak end demand in some other food-related products, weak customer margins. Are you seeing any pressure to pass through some of that deflation that we're seeing in food these days and these price increases that you've announced for September 1 and October 1, are you getting any significant customer pushback to those so far?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So let me start with the last part of your question. Our September 1 Product Care price increase went through fully. Our October non-formula pricing Food Care price increase went in fully. Why? Because we had PE margins and nylon and so on margin compression, and we also had other type of inflation, including freight. And for those of you who don't know that post-Harvey had consequences on freight cost, availability of trucks, needing to buy resins on the spot market, and all of those kind of things because our priority number one was to delight our customers who were in difficult times for supply themselves, et cetera. And we did not spare any efforts nor any money in making sure that we would have absolutely no disruption.", "Did that cost money? Absolutely. But what is absolutely important to understand is what I said exactly five years ago in January 2012 when I said we are the market leader. The market leader has a responsibility. And the responsibility for the market leader is to be disciplined and to lead on price. Yes, we do need to be leading on price. We have led on price, which is why we stood extraordinarily firm. Yes, we did hear that some competitors were not as disciplined. That's their problem.", "In order to keep investing the amount of money we're investing in innovation; in order to bring them, our customers, the revolutionary solutions that we're bringing them, and surprise them by adding value, tremendous new value to them, we need to be able to have the funds and the resources. And, therefore, keep investing at the pace we're investing and, by the way, accelerating to bring those solutions in automation, in new products, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the context.", "Next to that, you do have \u2013 and this is why we are already slightly improving on our margins compared to the first half of the year as a result of having this September 1 price increase in Product Care and such (32: 35). So do we have competition? Yes, we do have competition. But you have customers who are price-driven customers, which are not the ones we want; and you have customers who are value customers, which is those we want. And we are absolutely committed to continue, thanks to our solutions, to add new additional and much higher value than they could get from a slight price concession.", "Do we have market skirmishes here and there? Of course, but not very much more than before. Depending on the country, including in the U.S., we had some competitors who were a little bit desperate in taking business, but this is normal.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, could we jump to the next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Again, congratulations to everybody and welcome. And also, thanks to Carol for all her efforts the last couple years. I wanted to come back to the margin question a little bit differently. Can you tell us maybe in rank-order priority, what gives you confidence that in 2018 that you'll be able to leverage the very, very good volume growth to date, and presumably positive volume growth into 2018 into stronger EBITDA? Will it be more from the pricing? Will it be more from the formula lags turning more favorably? And what, Ted, do you think, at this juncture, can operational excellence add to the margin picture for 2018? Thank you.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Good. Thanks, George. I'll start and Ted will continue. George, all of the above and our innovation, which means that you saw that we have renewed with constant currency growth in the fourth quarter of 2016. And since then it's been on and on and accelerating. The comparables are going to get a little bit tougher, but it is our innovation which is fueling all of this, the success of the strategy that we have embarked into in Product Care moving to automation.", "The very successful B+ acquisition of August 2015 continues at a fast pace. The deployment of those automation technologies in Japan, in China, in Europe, and in North America had some tremendous success. And also our automation in Food Care with Cogni Link and CogniPRO (35: 34), and on the other end, our case-ready which is really starting to take hold. So we're very confident that we are exactly on the pace to do and execute on what we said back in June 2015 when we gave the 2016 to 2018 look during our Analyst Day. It is actually amazing to see how what we said at that time is happening.", "Then back to your question on margin. We have formulas in Food Care and they have been a little bit slower to kick in because they would have kicked in \u2013 they were supposed to kick in from the third quarter as resins were coming down and as formulas was coming up, leading to margin expansion. And as resins came up, you see that this phenomenon is slightly delayed. And we have proven to you in the past that in an environment like the one we're going to lead through probably through the end of this year and into early next year, we are going to restore our margins. You had a quick follow-up to Ted on the operational excellence maybe.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. So just in terms of what you've just discussed, just quickly, what's most important? Is it the innovation? Is it the price? Or is it the formula? I just want again kind of a stack rank if that's possible. If not, I understand.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "I can't stack because I don't have the detail of every single...", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "...number there. But it is all of the above. We do have a tremendous pull (37: 26) from our innovation. You know that depending on the division, some of those kick in faster than some others. The operation on trade needs to be approved by the retailer. This is done through \u2013 and we talked about this...", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "...on the cycle of innovation. And in some Product Care, it comes faster. And we're seeing all of those benefits. But there is discipline in this thing. The good thing about Sealed Air is that we say what we do and what we do what we say. And we are a disciplined organization. We are executing on it. And we demand value from our customers because we know we are bringing them tremendous value in the total cost to serve operation that they run.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And on op excellence?", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yeah. Well, let me segue those two going into three, because you're talking about 2018. And internally, that's the one that I'm possessive about. On the pricing, just to make a comment, Jerome has just done a tremendous job. And one thing I just wanted to let you, George, and everybody know that I'll be taking over as the Chief Pricing Officer from Jerome. So feel comfortable with that. Some of the pricing opportunities we have I think are in the business that we need to look at and push pricing for certain options, other things that are there. So we have some pricing opportunity going forward.", "On the innovation side, as Jerome highlighted, that's been really exciting for me in just my first six weeks to see how we're at the table, not with itty-bitty but with the big players. Jerome has introduced me, I've got to meet some of the major players, and we're there talking about their biggest problems. If we stay in that commodity base where some of our competitors are, then we have to live with the pricing and that will bring up operational excellence. We got to continue to drive our cost down. But with these innovations, for instance, statistic on flatscreen TVs going to the Internet, over half of them are being shipped. The number one problem that major ecommerce customers are having is damage. How could we fix that? We're at the table to do that.", "The second problem is making it easy and environmentally friendly for where it shows up. So we're on conservation not what is the price of your product, can you help us solve this problem, bring that solution across, and we have some really cool innovative technology that we're talking about the solution and there's no conversation what was widget A versus widget B last year. So that ties innovation into the pricing and the margin that you want to see.", "The third piece is the operational excellence. I think we have an opportunity to really drive the business to world-class level in operational excellence. We've had a huge disruption in the business with the sale of Diversey. Really bringing the team together, looking at our facilities around the world, what can we do to bring some operational excellence to the bottom line in 2018. I think we have some opportunities there and give you bridgeable items. We're not giving any guidance on 2018, but just to give you some thoughts on what we're looking at.", "George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Your line is open.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. Bill and Ted, congratulations. And Jerome, it's obviously been a pleasure working with you over the years. And on behalf of the team, good luck as you head into the future.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So, as for my question, given the significant improvement in 2017 and the related tougher comparisons, what is your volume growth expectations for the North American Food Care business specifically, kind of as we head into the end of the year and specifically as we think about 2018?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "So I'm not going to give you a guidance for 2018. But in 2017 for the rest of the year, we have \u2013 in my prepared remarks, I made a comment about that, and we said that we are expecting about 3.5% or 4%. Altogether \u2013 what did you say? 4%. Lori said 4%.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "4.5%.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "4.5%, Lori said. And, actually, what does this mean? It means that the momentum keeps on. It means that we have the North American cycle in full swing. Exports are good and strong. The slaughter rate is good and strong. And we are right now in the middle of the quarter, and there is nothing else to say than that.", "We're also looking at other protein. And the reason why we are, and it is as successful. And you hear about the beef cattle cycle at 5% slaughter rate increase, but you see our total business being very solid. And you know that our red \u2013 our meat, our cattle, beef prices or beef products are only a part of the whole thing, and we are having success with our case-ready solutions all over. And there is a change in the marketplaces, including in North America with our case-ready solutions because the market is changing, because of the need for sustainability, because, for example, California having banned foam trays and those kinds of things. And therefore, you have MAP, modified atmosphere packaging, and you have our Darfresh which is kicking in very nicely. So we're confident. 2018, you're going to see that there is \u2013 that the comparable there will be easier, but when Ted is going to give you a guidance for the company and by businesses in February, this momentum is there and this is not a commodity business. The momentum is there.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yes, good morning and congratulations to all and all the best to you, Jerome, as you move on to the next place, next phase.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "My question has to do with thinking about e-commerce. I know it's still relatively small but growing very quickly, and obviously, a big factor as we think about Product Care. And I know in the past, it's intended to be in products that are growing but yet have smaller margins. And I just didn't know as you think about, Ted, the future, how you think that proportion will grow as a percentage of the total segment and what do you think the ultimate margin impact will be from ecommerce, in Product Care?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "You will love the Investor Day when it comes and you will get under-the-tent on our ecommerce 3PL solution. Having said that, and let me stay with the present, Ted will talk about the future. But with regards to the present, we had slight negative mix, which is being corrected, I can't say day-after-day but month-after-month as we are introducing our automation solutions and innovations, which are not only automation solutions. There are some very big phone companies who launch new products and they have our solution as the product in which their phones are packed through the Internet. And this is big business.", "And it is this innovation and it is this need for not only addressing dimensional weight, which is the number one cash costs operation in the cost-to-serve of ecommerce ,number one is dimensional weight, which means freight cost. The number two is labor productivity, is labor. Number three, damage when the items are fragile; number one, it is the cost of packaging. What we do is reducing freight costs, is improving labor productivity, eliminating damage, and we do that with a little, slowest, smallest cost component, which is our packaging cost and the solution, which adds total value to our customers. So, yes, this ecommerce and 3PL business is growing much faster and the margins are improving quarter after quarter as we address our \u2013 as we introduce our innovation and our solutions. So that's important to understand because it was an issue in 2016, a little bit in the beginning of 2017, and it is being gradually and nicely corrected. Ted, future of Product Care?", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "Sure, and to answer the question, to tie into the operational excellence again, if we're going to commit to operating margin leverage, consistent and reliable, that means the product portfolio has got to match. And if you look at ecommerce, not mentioning any customer names, but imagine one of the largest ecommerce companies buying a food company, it's going to bring us together pretty quickly. That means that we're going to be shipping most of this stuff and extending the shelf life that has made Food Care the dominant player in the industry. Now the shelf life has to go to the truck life, to the plane life. And so, they're having to solve these problems with us, so the problems that we're bringing in are actually in the solutions.", "In the Product Care, to the point of where we get ecommerce quickly, because that's moving \u2013 everybody sees these products showing up at their homes, you don't want to see the polystyrene or \u2013 as I'm being trained by Jerome \u2013 or the Styrofoam all over your house. It's a problem. You don't want to see these packages that you're unpacking. You can even hurt yourself. So we're working on some innovative designs, and I mentioned the flat-screen TV. Over half are now being purchased on the Internet. So our solutions that we're working on when you pull that out of the box, make it nice and pretty. Maybe \u2013 do you really need the box? Do you need that Styrofoam that you're throwing away? So the margins, to answer your question, have to be in line with our portfolio, higher than our portfolio, as we bring these new innovations. How we're doing it? We're saving our customers a tremendous amount of money is pulling the solutions. So, short answer, the new innovations for Product Care have to be at higher margins than the existing portfolio.", "Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Freuchtel of SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning, everyone, and congratulations.", "William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.", "Morning, Jason.", "Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Fagerdala seems like an ideal acquisition target given its exposure to Asian technology. Can you spend some time elaborating on the attractive aspects of Fagerdala? And are these aspects potentially telling of what you're looking for in future acquisitions? Thank you and good luck on your next marathon, Jerome.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "Do you want me to take this one?", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "I'll just start because I was intimately with Ken Chrisman in the early negotiations. And I will tell you that most companies look at the products and they look at the segment in which the target participates, et cetera. What I did really look at is quality of management.", "We all know that when you buy a Chinese company in China, you have to do your due diligence extremely tightly because you sometimes never know what you buy. We bought a Singaporean company which has operations and its major operations in China. So, we bought quality, quality, quality. What we also bought is superb management. That is really very important. And on top of that, we bought an extraordinarily efficient fabricator. And (51: 12) has traveled with Ken to see their operation and will make comments. And the short story is that he was very impressed with what we intend to do. And remember, fabrication is not what we do, but we want to be Chinese in China. We are becoming Chinese in China, and this is extremely important. Ted?", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "No, that's a good summary. And as Jerome highlighted, in my six weeks, I got to spend a week in China looking at the operation and actually two full days with Ken, and got to meet the Fagerdala team. And if we look at the product and why this makes sense strategically, as Jerome highlighted, it's an integrated manufacturer. Instead of us selling the polyethylene to an integrator and letting them do that value add, this is what they do and they do really, really well.", "And as Jerome said, they win in China and I got to witness this. I got to meet with their three largest customers who happen to be the three largest PC manufacturers in the world in China. So, they were at the table. They're talking what they can do to be their committed supplier in this area. And also, those suppliers are asking them, can we move that now to the other facilities around the world. So not only does it have geographic growth potential for integrated packaging, it also has the potential to go outside.", "The second piece on there is the China piece that, being in China, I wish I didn't have so much experience on China, you have to be \u2013 in China you have to be Chinese to win in China. And I was extremely impressed with their management team. Three full days from the top, watching the people on the shop floor, seeing their facilities where they do things very, very different than we do. I think the complement there is going to be exciting for us, but they win in China and the customers, these major PC manufacturers are asking, can we bring that solution outside of China as we grow this business. So, pretty exciting opportunity for us.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Langton of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on corporate expense. I now you lowered the guidance to $115 million from $125 million, so I was just kind of wondering what was driving that, and then also to see if there's any change to your sort of the longer-term outlook which I think was reducing unallocated by $25 million by 2018 and then reducing stranded costs by about half in two years.", "William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yes. Thank you for your question. One of the things that I've noticed with the Sealed Air management team over the years of being here is our ability to quickly adapt to changing business conditions and also to contract spending when the conditions actually merit that action. This, along with our initial actions to reduce the unallocated and the stranded cost, is why we're now estimating our corporate expenses to be approximately $115 million for the full-year 2017.", "Ted and I have actually been meeting quite a bit, working together on our specific plans to address these stranded costs, as well as unallocated costs going forward. And we'll continue to support the growth initiatives while, at the same time, addressing stranded cost, relative to the types of cost, we've said that we have $20 million of unallocated costs and they're actually going to be offset by transition services agreement revenue. That TSA revenue actually began on September 6 when we closed the Diversey transaction, and they will go forward on a 12 to an 18-month period beginning in September of 2017 and will also then give us time to specifically reduce those unallocated costs.", "Meanwhile, for the $20 million of stranded costs, we are absolutely on-track and we're very confident that our 24-month target, which is 24 months since the separation, is achievable and we will work towards that goal.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, we have time for one more question, please.", "Operator", "Yes, ma'am. Our last question is from Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Your line is open.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you and welcome, Ted and Bill. And, Jerome, good luck.", "Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.", "Thank you.", "Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC", "Just one quick question on the timing of the remaining share buyback. What's going to determine how aggressive you are, I mean, in terms of what's remaining, I mean, should we expect over the next several quarters that is it going to be longer than that, is it going to be like within a year? I mean, just want to a get a sense on what you're thinking there, Ted.", "William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.", "Sure. We have $1.4 billion remaining on the share buyback program. As we stated, we used 190 million shares for the guidance that we gave for the balance of 2017. And we don't actually disclose specific plans, but you can actually expect us to be very active in the market for the balance of 2017 through our normal methods of ASRs and OMR plans.", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "Yeah. And just for the capital allocation story there, to commit to the share buyback as we've announced, but also looking at that what is the strategic M&A opportunities that we're looking at. So, not to give you a specific number, but we're going to be active in the market and follow with our commitment there on the buybacks.", "Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.", "Operator, I want to thank everybody for your questions, but before we conclude the call, I'd like to pass the call back to Ted for some closing remarks. Ted?", "Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Lori. And as we wrap up, I would just like to take the opportunity to thank Jerome for his passion and commitment to creating significant value at Sealed Air. And for me personally, it's been a pleasure spending this time in the transition with Jerome and making an introduction to the people, our customers, and I just want to share with you in front of your investment friends a big thank you from me personally.", "So, Vince, that concludes our call this morning.

Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.", "Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov.", "We will also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in our earnings release. Included in today\u2019s presentation on slide three, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that correspond to some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures we referenced through the presentation.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?", "Ted Doheny", "Thanks, Lori. I want to thank all of you for your interest in Sealed Air and welcome to our 2017 fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I\u2019ll begin the call with a few brief comments and then ask Bill to expand upon our press release and provide additional background on our financial results for the quarter and the year.", "I\u2019ll then provide you with our strategy and outlook for 2018 with a discussion around end market growth and how we plan to further leverage our innovations. I\u2019ll also discuss actions we are taking to improve operational productivity across the globe.", "After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session. To recap 2017 results, let\u2019s start with what went well. Our sales accelerated into yearend resulting in a 9% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. Throughout the year, we capitalized on strong end market trends within the protein and e-commerce sectors.", "We reported adjusted EBITDA and EPS of $833 million and $1.81 per share respectively, slightly higher than guidance we provided on our last conference call. Free cash flow was above our expectations at $420 million due to working capital management. We executed on our share repurchase program returning 1.3 billion of capital since January 2017 through the use of open market and accelerated share repurchase programs.", "We have more than $860 million currently remaining under our authorised share repurchase program. What we would like to improve is our operating leverage, meaning how our year-over-year sales growth translates in to earnings growth.", "In 2017, our operating leverage or what we call our profit to growth ratio was only 10%. We expect this ratio to double in 2018 with planned cost reductions and higher sales of our market leading solutions offsetting the expected rise of our input costs.", "Today, we are the premier specially packaging company in the world. I\u2019m excited to see the potential that we have within Sealed Air and our ability to take our performance to the next level. I\u2019ve been working closely with their leadership team to accelerate our strategy. We\u2019ll focus on growth from new innovations, drive operational excellence, recognize and promote talent and target strategic M&A all of which will produce higher returns on invested capital and maximise free cash flow, taking us to world class performance.", "Let me now pass the call to Bill to provide more detail on our fourth quarter and year-end results. Bill?", "William Stiehl", "Thank you Ted. Turning to slide five, let\u2019s start with the review of our net sales by region. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $1.2 billion in net sales, an increase of 11% on our reported basis and 9% on a constant basis. All regions delivered constant dollar sales growth. Asia Pacific was our fastest growing region at 17% growth, which includes sale from our recent Fagerdala acquisition in the integrated fabrication solutions space.", "Sales in North America were up 10% with Food Care delivering 10% and Product Care delivering 9%. Latin America was up 6% led by a strong rebound in the fresh meat markets coupled with new customer wins in Brazil.", "Europe, Middle-East and Africa increased 5% with positive trends in France, the U.K. and Italy.", "Slide six illustrates net sales by region for the full year. North America was our fastest growing region followed by Asia Pacific. We are pleased to report that sales improved in EMEA and Latin America in the second half of the year resulting in favourable sales trend in both regions.", "Turning to slide seven, let me walk you through our fourth quarter net sales and adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.2 billion in net sales. Volume contributed $55 million, price mix was $23 million favourable and we reported $24 million in incremental sales from our Fagerdala acquisition.", "Currency translation was favourable $25 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $238 million or 19.4% of net sales. Volume growth contributed $21 million and mix and price/cost spread was $2 million favourable.", "The fourth quarter represents the first time in 2017 that we reported a positive mix and price /cost spread. Restructuring savings were $4 million. Operating costs including acquisitions increased $10 million. Currency was a favourable $5 million.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.58 on an average diluted shares outstanding of $176 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarter.", "On slide eight, we illustrate the same bridge for the full year. Our topline growth in 2017 was primarily driven by strong volume. Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to volume growth partially offset by higher raw material costs, stranded cost related to the divestiture of the Diversey business and salary and wage inflation.", "Adjusted earnings per share were $1.81 on an average diluted shares outstanding of $189 million. We exited the year with 168 million shares outstanding. Our adjusted tax rate for the full year 2017 was 30% in line with our forecast.", "Turning to slide nine, we highlight the impact of the U.S. tax reform. In the fourth quarter, we reported a $36 million tax expense to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21%.", "The actual impact of the transition tax is still being evaluated and we will record this in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, we estimate that our effective income tax rate will be approximately 29%. The benefit of the U.S. corporate rate reduction is largely offset for us by the base broadening provisions. Going forward, we will absolutely continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our tax posture.", "Let\u2019s turn to our free cash flow for the full year on slide 10. 2017 free cash flow on a consolidated basis was a source of cash of $421 million. This compares to the guidance we provided on our last earnings call of approximately $400 million. The upside and consolidated free cash flow was driven by great working capital management.", "CapEx was $184 million which includes $23 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. In those payments, net of interest income were $186 million and cash tax payments were $152 million.", "Let me now pass the call back to Ted for more details on our revisions as well as our outlook.", "Ted Doheny", "Thank you, Bill. Turning to slide 11 which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. On a global basis, volume trends were up 4% to 5% throughout the year. This compares to volume trends of 1% to 2% throughout 2016.", "In the fourth quarter of 2017, we delivered favourable price mix which helped offset higher material cost. Our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect September 1 and in Food Care for a non-formula customers effective October 1.", "As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to take price actions on a rising input cost. We recognize the success of our value capture pricing strategy is dependent on our ability to save our customers money and solve their most critical packaging challenges, through a highly differentiated products, services and solution we\u2019ll do just that, save money and solve problems.", "Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 and review Food Care results. For the full year of 2017, Food Care delivered $2.8 billion in net sales or 4% constant dollar sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $608 million or 21.6% of net sales.", "On the top line our business benefit from the continued adoption of our market leading portfolio and the growing protein market particularly in North America. However, the timing of formula pricing and rapidly increasing raw material cost put some pressure on our margins throughout the year.", "As we look forward, I want to highlight the trends driving our profitable growth strategy in 2018. First, our case ready platform including both materials and systems accounted for nearly 20% of our Food Care sales in 2017, and delivered high single digit growth. We expect this level of growth to continue as we further penetrate global market and introduce new, sustainable solutions for the seafood in convenient segments.", "Second, in high growth geographies, such as Brazil, Russia, China and Southeast Asia we are well-positioned to serve the increased demand for package protein, and drive the adaption of applications that extend shelf life and reduce shrink.", "And third, we expect continued growth in North America, yet at a more moderated rate as compared to 2017. For the full year of 2018, we expect Food Care sales to increase 3% in constant dollars and adjusted EBITDA margins to be relatively in line with 2017.", "Similar to last year, we expect Q1, 2018 to be a low point for EBITDA, primarily due to the timing of our contract pass-through and higher input cost.", "Moving to slide 13 where we highlight results from our Product Care division. For the full year 2017, Product Care delivered $1.6 billion in net sales for a 8% constant dollar growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $332 million or 20.2% of sales.", "We will continue to work our portfolio towards a higher mix of solutions and services that eliminate waste. These solutions include our growing portfolio of inflatables, our automated systems such as I-Pack, StealthWrap in our unique Korrvu platform.", "Inflatables, Automated Systems in Korrvu increased in excess of 15% and accounted for approximately 20% of our total sales in 2017. Another highlight in 2017 is the positive trend we are seeing in Instapak business.", "Our business-to-business customers are under increasing pressures to modify their packaging for the small parcel e-commerce fulfilment network, a trend called ship in own container or SIOC. This aligns well with our pallet-to-parcel strategy. Sales of Instapak were up in the mid single digits and we expect this to continue into 2018.", "With the addition of Fagerdala in the fourth quarter, we are now a leading provider of packaging solution serving the electronics market. We keep finding additional synergies from these acquisitions where we can lever a broad leverage, a broad solutions portfolio and global reach.", "For the full year 2018, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 7%. We are seeing profitable growth from our recent acquisition of Fagerdala and expect it to contribute $95 million in Product Care sales.", "Even with the integration of cost associated with Fagerdala acquisition and resilient raw material environment, we expect Product Care margins to be close to 20% level in 2018.", "Turning to our Total Company 2018 outlook on slide 14, net sales are expected to be in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.8 billion with constant dollar growth of approximately 4.5%. Adjusted EBITD is expected to be in a range of $890 million to $910 million, implying an EBITDA margin of 19%.", "I would like to highlight that we are taking actions to realign our corporate function. In 2018, we expect corporate cost to be below $100 million compared to the $107 million in 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $2.35 to $2.45. This forecast assumes no additional share repurchases in 2018.", "We forecast free cash flow from continuing operations to be approximately $400 million, net of capital expenditures of $160 million. Our free cash flow forecast also includes a $45 million payment in lieu of certain royalty payments for patents to an outside engineering firm.", "Just before year-end, we entered into an agreement to pay $50 million of which $5 million was paid in 2017 and the remaining was paid in late January. By taking design ownership in-house or expediting our organizational productivity initiatives.", "Keep in mind that cash flow of $421 million we recorded in 2017 is on a consolidated basis. If you exclude the cash generated from Diversity in 2017, our free cash flow outlook in 2018 reflects a year-over-year.", "To wrap up this call, I\u2019d like to provide a brief discussion on our strategic directions which you can see at a high level on slide 15. First, we will focus on increasing sales from a highly differentiated, innovative, sustainable and profitable solutions that are in high demand in the market. We\u2019ll target incremental, profitable growth opportunities in adjacent markets and expand our presence in high-growth geographies. In the end to reiterate what I said on our last earnings call, regarding M&A, we are looking for technology, equipment and automation opportunities that enhance our business and are accretive to earnings.", "Second, we\u2019ll optimize our cost structure by doing more with less and by investing in working smarter. This goes beyond our efforts to eliminate stranded costs related to the Diversey sale. We\u2019re creating a one Sealed Air culture that will drive productivity gains and eliminate redundancy.", "For instance, in January, we had expanded the responsibility of some of the most talented leaders to attack our biggest challenges. Karl Deily, in addition to his role as President of our Food Care business is now also leading our innovation\u2019s team for all of Sealed Air.", "We moved sustainability under innovation to accelerate our efforts as sustainability is critical to our customer\u2019s success. Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division is now also leading commercial action to strengthen the partnership with our Global Sales team to simplify our processes, lower our cost structure and offer exceptional customer service globally.", "And Mark Hammer, our CIO and Chief Digital Officer, is taking on additional responsibility to lead our customer service team. This is in addition to the exciting digital work that Mark is already leading with their team on our smartly connected products and enabling our automated solutions. With Mark leading customer service, we\u2019ll invest in tools and technologies that better connects our team with our internal and external systems, so that we get the right product and the right place at the right time.", "Third, we\u2019ll maximize our operating leverage with the successful implementation of the Sealed Air operating excellence culture. We already had big systems in place, but we clearly had opportunities for improvement.", "For instance, we are upgrading assets to the latest technologies investing in breakthrough production processes. We\u2019ll continue our efforts on SKU rationalization simplify our supply chain and improve quality.", "Our operational discipline will apply not only internally, but also externally with our customers, in future acquisition to quickly capture synergies. And lastly, we\u2019ll continue to develop sustainable solutions that leave our world, environment and communities better than we found them.", "We are always finding new ways to reduce our resource intensity and waste for ourselves and our customers. Addressing foodwaste, product damage in our environment are all priorities for us. By moving sustainability under innovation, it will be at the core of what we do and how we operate.", "Accelerating our efforts and sustainability will not only make us more profitable, it\u2019s the right thing to do. We are committed to creating value for our customer\u2019s shareholders in the communities where we live and work. Before I open up the call for your questions, we ask that you please mark your calendars for Thursday, May 3 for our first quarter 2018 earnings call.", "Sabrina, we would like to begin the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Hey guys good morning.", "Ted Doheny", "Good morning.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "So first off you\u2019ve seen a very nice acceleration in Food volumes during the back half of 2017 at up 5%, pricing is also starting to flow through in that segment, I know you have tougher comps, but were you expecting a particular region to see a moderation in volumes in 2018, I guess in front to reconcile a momentum you saw in the backhalf 2017 versus your 3% core sales guidance for that segment for 2018?", "Ted Doheny", "This is Ted. Hi Ghansham, what we are looking at basically continuing the volume of the fourth quarter but if we break it up by region, continued strength of North America, but that will be tampered year-over-year as we highlight it. We do think some opportunity in Europe moving that up basically due to our equipment. Latin America was a pickup, we had some strong equipment sales but we do think the pickup year-over-year will probably be tampered from what we saw in the fourth quarter.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Got it. And just as a follow up question, on your EBITDA waterfall slide for fiscal year 2017 and the 49 million in unfavorable price cost, Ted how should we sort of think about the recovery timeline associated with that? Thanks so much.", "Ted Doheny", "So the EBITDA on the bridge?", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Hmm.", "Ted Doheny", "Well first of all as you\u2019ve highlighted the pricing issue that we were chasing all of 2017, we saw some catch up in the fourth quarter, but we are still behind on the catch-up up with a price cost mix. We think in the first quarter, we still have residents that we could be working against us. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll probably get ahead of that until maybe the second year of the year, so it looks like continued discipline on the pricing should help us stay ahead of it. Bill if you want to ask anything more on this", "William Stiehl", "No I think we are very happy about the \u2013 for the fourth quarter of 2017 we saw a very positive price cost spread. I mean, we did not have that luxury in the earlier part of 2017 and we are very excited to have this go positive and we think this is a good momentum going forward into 2018, although as we indicated our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sale is flat in total Food Care from 2017 to 2018.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please. Thanks Ghansham", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclay. Your line is now open.", "Scott Gaffner", "Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow up on that real quick, on the increased raw material pricing. I know it\u2019s early in your tenure with the company, but anything that you see so far around the ability for Sealed Air to maybe move more towards automatic pass through of resins on a go forward basis, are you comfortable with where the company stands today from a pricing perspective?", "Ted Doheny", "Yes, good question as being a price zealot in my past and building off of the good work that Jerome has done. If you look at that, what I\u2019ve been looking understanding how the formula pricing works with our Food Care business. And I think that it works out well, the danger with that is the shock that hit looking at what happened with Harvey is how quickly can recover. So don\u2019t like the fact that we can\u2019t catch up to that quickly, it does catch up over time to lead lag on that.", "On the Product Care side though when we are connected to our customers, we should be able to respond more quickly and effectively on price. I think if we analyze last year on the pricing, I think we could have got ahead of that sooner, quicker and the team recognized and understand that. I think we\u2019re on top of that pricing billing in to 2018.", "I think the real issue that like to accelerate, I see it in the business and it\u2019s exciting, and you hear us talk about value capture is what we are doing in the marketplace. It\u2019s really saving our customers significant amount of money with some of these new solutions.", "And then really how do we share that savings? So I think we have some opportunity on value capture going forward. I think the discipline in the business is there. Shocks hurt us, so we got to find a way to get ahead of that quicker, but I think on the pricing side, there\u2019s some good things there. The opportunity as we drive more solutions and especially as we bring equipment, becoming a larger part of our portfolio as our customers drive to automation, I think we have some pricing or value capture opportunity going forward.", "Scott Gaffner", "Okay and you mentioned -- the follow-up to that. You mentioned that you expected some drag from rising raw material prices in the first half of 2018. And Bill I think you mentioned 20% EBITDA margin in product care. Where should we \u2013 are we going to see that more -- the rising raw material, lingering raw material increase more in food care or more in product care as we move through 2018? Thanks.", "Ted Doheny", "I\u2019ll go first and let\u2019s see if Bill wants to add some color to that. As we mentioned we see that the raw material going up and as we look it that\u2019s going into the fourth quarter we saw more pressure for lots of different reasons, oil etcetera putting pressure on the raw material environment. So we think it\u2019s still going to be a resilient environment that we\u2019re going to have to manage through probably the whole first half of the year, so if we do see improvement it\u2019ll be in the second half but not to the first half. Our guidance is based on the resin environment being flat. So slightly up for the full year and so if we see a benefit we don\u2019t see it \u2013 we don\u2019t see any in our guidance until a little bit potentially in the second half of the year.", "William Stiehl", "I think the original assumptions that a lot of folks have relative to 2018 would've been that we would've seen some quicker decreases in resin prices in 2018 because of Harvey and the other factors that Ted has indicated we haven\u2019t enjoy that decrease and we\u2019re actually planning on an increase in the resin cost as we go year-over-year moving forward. But it is something that we watch and we\u2019re in constant communication with our supply chain team to assess the current impact of any changes in resin prices on our total P&L give our understanding of what percentage of our customer and food care versus product care are on formula pricing versus those that are not on formula prices.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question will come from line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "George Staphos", "Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all of the detail and congratulation on the year and good luck going forward Bill and Ted. I guess the first question I had just piggybacking on the last couple of questions from Scott and Ghansham on food. So, on the one hand your price increases in food and non-contract came little bit later than product care and that might be one of the reasons that you had less price cost mix positive, it was a negative in the last quarter versus positive in product care. Question one, are you out with any additional non-formula price increase in food or for that matter in product care. And should we assume for the time being that price mix cost for food care is at least as negative if not worst for the first half, and then had a question on operational excellence.", "Ted Doheny", "So, the answer is yes. We were out there with price increase, but as you know George we got the lead lag there seeing the effect of that. So, we\u2019re out there with the price increase where the formulas will have to wait. Where we don\u2019t have formulas, yes, we\u2019re out there with the price.", "George Staphos", "And we should assume at least a similar negative if not worst in price cost mix for food for the first half as what you saw in the fourth quarter?", "Ted Doheny", "I would say, slowly seeing that recover through the year and we just not anticipating the gain till the second half.", "George Staphos", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then the other question I had on operational excellence and some of the other initiatives that you\u2019re going to be building in to Sealed Air, I mean, traditionally Sealed Air at least from our observations was a pretty asset like business to begin with, it tends to have a greater number of smaller facilities that was one of the things that made it such a good cash generator, but that kind of disparate business model might not lend itself to benchmarking and the sorts of things that are usually involved in operational excellence. So tell me where I\u2019m wrong there if you can quantify what kind of uptake you see from this down the road and maybe one or two kind of for instances in terms of what some of the practice that you\u2019ll bring in? Thank you very much.", "Ted Doheny", "Well, let me unpack a little bit here, if I can correct one word, because the team and working closely, tremendous team. And so I don\u2019t want to call it an initiative and the team is already working on the word, what we\u2019re going to call it a culture, because there\u2019s a lot of good things going on here and I think you understand it\u2019s not the program of the month, how do we drive this culture, so good question is look at the business and is been impacting and traveling the world, looking at our facilities, talking to our customers. Now being on the inside, I see a lot of manufacturing that from the outside looking and I do realize.", "So we have a lot of manufacturing opportunities to bring this network together. But its quite interestingly, we buy close to a 1 billion tons of this thing called resin and then we converted into this really, really special products that we sell literally in millions. In our customers, so you want to have a very concentrated huge extrusion lines to do that very effectively and efficiently, but we\u2019re so market focus and so customer focused, they want to buy those specialized bags a 100 at a time.", "So how do you do that mixed model being connected around the world, we can't be everywhere at once, so that\u2019s the part of the operational excellence that I think we can do make some impact. So let me unpack that a little bit. Let\u2019s talk about how we buy our resin. The supply chain team has done a really, really nice job of not being dependent on one. Now we haven\u2019t gotten totally where we need to be but diversifying the supply base, so getting through having multiple suppliers that we can work with, so we can get the most effective cost and definitely the most cost compared to our competitors that we serve that market.", "The next linking that to our facilities and our engine -- not engineering I apologize. I can\u2019t use engineering now that I came from this company because I\u2019m dealing with scientist. Connecting the scientist on this very, very specialized product, how can we alter our formulas, alter what the facilities are actually producing and converting can do it in with the different process. So, on the operational excellence side linking those too tighter I think we have some significant opportunities.", "Then also on the supply chain side connecting how we buy it, how we convert it and then its how we sell it. So operational excellence on just a number of SKUs, there's a lot of working going on there, but can we really analyze, do we need all these different products and if we had the right product in front of our customer we\u2019re able sell quickly and efficiently, maybe they would buy that versus asking for a specialized product for those 10 bags to put in their turkey.", "So those are top-three highlights that I\u2019ve seen, I'm sure you'll have or that we follow questions on the capital allocation what work we do with and with respect to operational excellence, but there\u2019s another piece here that\u2019s pretty exciting for me coming in as the new guy taking over Jerome. There was a huge divestiture of this thing called Diversey. So one of the fundamental things were changing is this one seal they look as we had three fairly large divisions and one corporate. So we\u2019re kind of looking at it differently saying let's have one corporate serving two divisions and acting as one company. So there is \u2013 I think there is a lot of opportunity there with the resources focus on serving those two markets as one company.", "George Staphos", "Thank you, Ted.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Lars Kjellberg", "Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to come back to costs. Could you share where you are on addressing this stranded costs and also if you want to progress through a bit about your thoughts about equipment installations and how that can drive your growth going forward if that's going to be an incremental focus to drive that stronger growth and in particular that profit-to-growth doubling that just discussed in 2018?", "William Stiehl", "So, I\u2019ll address the stranded cost piece and what we had said during last quarter\u2019s earnings call is that we have $20 million of unallocated cost that we were going to address throughout 2018 and if those unallocated cost would be offset by a transition services revenue that we were getting beginning September 6th associated with the Diversey separation. And as we look at our fourth quarter results we saw just this occur that that transition services revenue was able to offset those cost.", "And we also pick that momentum in terms of addressing our stranded cost. We\u2019re going to continue to have that transition services agreement revenue for 12 to 18 months after the close of the Diversey Care transaction, but we\u2019ve definitely picked up momentum in addressing stranded cost. You\u2019ll see that relative to our performance in the corporate bucket in the fourth quarter of 2017 being at 107 million versus what we had originally estimated at a 115.", "And we also up here to have a increased momentum in the reduction of those stranded cost going forward and we\u2019re highly motivated to make the decisions necessary to get our stranded costs under control and to be a new Sealed Air terms of the corporate cost structure that Ted indicates.", "Ted Doheny", "And if I can piggyback on that with the corporate costs and you mentioned PG ratios equipment. But to segue those two together, first of all on the corporate cost, we will returning that stranded cost into the phrase of driving organizational productivity. How do we do more with less by investing and working smarter? We will hit and exceed that stranded cost target. And your question in the equipment sales and PG ratio we\u2019re using the PG ratios as a guide to the team. So as we get growth we\u2019re looking to qualify growth, good growth for us is means that we\u2019re call it profitable growth and drive that through our business not just straight growth.", "So equipment sales less than 10% of our business in equipment sales, but so what do we do we solve problems. So if you look at both markets its quite interesting if you look at food care and product care. What they do is solve problems. Now food care maybe extending the way the shelf life of the product, but it was quite interesting I\u2019ve gotten and now visit two customers that I was at the Food Show with Karl, just last week and I got the CR booth when we talk about automation. So I got to see chickens being loaded and setup and ready to go into our exclusive bag, but I saw automation on the front side but then there is a lot of people around actually then have to adjust it, getting it ready for the automation where we seal it and protect it and use some of our exclusive processes.", "I was listening to customers, watch this process and I heard just incredible data going out. One of our largest customers shared \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe the number, but they have 42% absenteeism. So the more we can work on automation with our equipment help solve that problem significant opportunity, so when we\u2019re looking at capturing the saving, we\u2019re going to slowdown little bit and say, hey, we get a lot of things to sell you, we\u2019re going to say what can we save you and that huge of waste automation is a big deal taking people out of harms way, but another part of way they just don\u2019t have the people right now to talk the manufacturers all over the world, getting the talent to go do this and also taking them out of harms way is a big element of waste.", "So how do we then bring that to profitable growth equipment now when we bring those solutions how do we share those saving and bring our exclusive solution to the customer. I think we can drive some significant margin opportunity going forward.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you and the next question will come of the line of Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Anojja Shah", "Hey, good morning. I wanted to go back to the two bridges of the segments. It\u2019s a pretty significant headway in each segment from operating cost. Is that a reallocation of some of the unallocated cost back to the segment or some explanation of what's going on in there and what the outlook is for that line in 2018?", "William Stiehl", "Thank you very much for the question. And we\u2019ve included our stranded cost and any sort of corporate cost not in our food care, in our product care resolve, but your question relates to the food care and product care operating expense item on the bridge and the strong driver of that negative item when you compare Q4 of 2016 compared to Q4 of 2017 is basically incentive compensation and other compensation related costs. Remember that we\u2019re comparing what our compensation expense would be in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the same period at year ago.", "The other point I would make is that Ted and I have certainly positioned ourselves well for our 2018 performance as we will look at expediting certain actions and those have already occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017.", "Anojja Shah", "Okay. Thank you for that. And thank you for all the detail on the operational excellence program, but is that going to require any capital spending, and if so how much?", "Ted Doheny", "Well, how about we talk about yes in certain places, but part of our CapEx spending that we have we will need some operational excellence if we have a new process in place to improve our facility. There will definitely some CapEx associated with that. We\u2019re guiding to $160 million of CapEx. We believe that\u2019s enough to accomplish it. We can use about operational excellence, some of its process change and won\u2019t be as capital intensive. Basically simple and this is internally and externally eliminate the waste, simplify the process and then automate.", "But before we do the automation we got to do those first steps and there\u2019s a lot of money be save there. So, but yes, we are looking at some interesting capital to solve some problems. Can we solve some of the tough problems like even on the resin with our large extrusion lines to be more effective and efficient, so we\u2019re looking at that, can we even work with our innovation team and different resins that we actually producing for our products. Again as we\u2019re driven to be more sustainable organization can we invest in capital that could change the resins that we use and drive to higher sustainable business for us and for our customer. So there\u2019ll be capital we can deploy in that area as well.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thank you, operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Brian Maguire", "Ted, I want to come back to that profit-to-growth ratio you mentioned earlier, I think you said it was at 10% last year. You hope to double it to 20%, I\u2019m assuming you're talking about sort of incremental margins there on the business and the current margins are in each segment already little bit above 20%, so sort of consistent with the guidance you\u2019ve got for segment margins that they maybe down a little bit, but just wondering where you think that that number can go to over time recognizing that you probably have some resin headwinds in 2018 and all these operational improvements won\u2019t really be kicking in yet, but is there a number or a target that you sort of have in mind for where you can get that to over time and how quickly do you think we can get there?", "Ted Doheny", "Now, it\u2019s a great question. And so, again the profit-to-growth target incremental is we \u2013 I said that we should be able to double that, but long-term what we would be looking, we were pointing to 25% on that. So basically the incremental volume that we bring in, we want to see 25% of that drop to the bottom line. So that\u2019s going to take a little time. So, but to do it in the first year I think clearly we can double it. How we can there faster, we\u2019re going to focus on the cost pretty hard as Bill highlighted. So that cost is we\u2019re going to take care of that.", "But the reason why it\u2019s important to put it out there not for you and our investors to understand, but it\u2019s also for our people. So we\u2019re already changing the metrics internally, lots of work with our teams changing our incentive systems, so to be fully aligned that incremental business that we bring in is going to be targeting that 25%. So then the second part of your question of the 25% of where we\u2019re going; if we\u2019re 20% business that showing you that we\u2019re pointing to at 25, so what do we do? We benchmark our peers. We look to what else is out there. But it also gave the teams had a lot of good at work. What is world-class? And that's where I use that subtlety in the phrase of the team that let\u2019s -- we\u2019re pretty good in packaging arguably the premier packaging business I don't argue with the team, but the team positive and says, are we world-class.", "So, are we going to point higher than the 25 over time, yes, but right now our sites are, let\u2019s go take this business to where it needs to be. And so that\u2019s going to be the guidelines if the growth coming in and that\u2019s we\u2019re going to commit to, get to. First year, 20%, and we doubling it from where we were, I think we have clear line of sight to do that. Second part of your question, 25 is the internal target if we\u2019re going after.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please. Sorry about that.", "Brian Maguire", "Sorry. Just at the \u2013 the EPS guide not including any more share repo. Just wondering if there\u2019s any change in the strategy there to pivot towards M&A or is that just for conservatism?", "Ted Doheny", "Yes. But its part of our capital allocation. As we look at share repurchase if we just want to be very transparent we want to have share that we could pivot off that if we see a better opportunity, a better return for the company both for the first question or the questions were asked about operational excellence, if we see capital we can deploy internally more valuable than buying our shares back then yes, if we see an M&A opportunity it is more valuable than buying our own shares then the answer is yes.", "But the other metric that would really drive and trying to inculcate into the whole organization is return on invested capital. So that we\u2019re looking at all of our internal investments whether its CapEx, whether its new products, new innovations, looking even for share repurchase, and that\u2019s we\u2019re going to be focus on the PG ratio on checking out what\u2019s coming in on the sales line and return on invested capital. So we\u2019re talking to you in the same language. We\u2019re talking internally in the same language and that\u2019s we\u2019re designing to. So yes, we have the ability to pivot on that share repurchase.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Thanks.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JP Morgan Your line is now open.", "Tyler Langton", "Good morning, thank you. Just had a question, I guess the clarification on the growth outlook in 2018 for product care. I think in the slides you mentioned constant dollar growth of 7% including Fagerdala and I think the acquisition I think that would contribute $95 million which seems to be 5% to 6% or that 7%, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of your thought on organic volume growth for product care in 2018?", "Ted Doheny", "If you pull the \u2013 and by the way just highlighting the 95 million we had -- I think we reported 24 million last year. So it\u2019s not incremental, it could be 95 a year, so we\u2019re looking at Fagerdala to do that. So underneath that with the product care we think we\u2019ll still have reasonable volume in that less than 5% organically if you pull out the Fagerdala and net 3% range just in guidance. So there\u2019s opportunity there but we see year-over-year decent growth for the market. We\u2019re going to go have to create it, but we\u2019re looking for profitable growth and that\u2019s we\u2019re actually guiding and guiding team as well bringing profitable growth and let\u2019s get that 3% on top of the acquisitions that we made for the Fagerdala.", "Tyler Langton", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Bill, I guess the operating costs were kind of I think in total like a 10 million headwind in 4Q and I know you talk about it before, but I guess in 2018, mean that something where sort of given asset which you\u2019re taking and now the total really shouldn\u2019t be drag in 2018 or should we expect some of the drag in the first quarter or two?", "William Stiehl", "No. We think that the year-over-year comparison that we\u2019re seeing in Q4 of 2017 compared to Q4 of 2016 is the most significant negative comparison we\u2019re going to have. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ll have those negative comps going forward relative to our operating expenses and I have -- you also indicate that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on having the right amount of cost for the new Sealed Air, continue to reduce our stranded cost as we go forward and also to be totally dedicated to as Ted indicates the profitable growth ratio and that concept.", "And I will say that that mindset has really about change behaviors here at Sealed Air already, I mean we had an executive committee meeting last week and a large portion of that meeting was spent with the executive leaders speaking about what our specific actions in the first quarter and the second quarter are going to be and the impact on the PG ratio. So it does change behavior and it does translate to the P&L and we were very optimistic in terms of that comp going forward in 2018.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thanks, Bill. Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Good morning. Ted, in your comments on M&A I think you indicated technology and automation were areas of focus. Is it fair to say that might lend itself to kind of smaller bolt on acquisitions that are kind of maybe more consistent with what Sealed Air has done recently. And then just some of your public peers have done large acquisitions and have argued that boosting their purchase, their resin purchase scale is a competitive advantage not sure if you subscribe to that, but just wonder if you give more color on M&A?", "William Stiehl", "No. I think its good question and I\u2019ll just build off the guidance that was out there from Jerome even back in back in 2015 looking in that we were in that $400 million look, so building off of that size. The danger for just seeing you buying a company because you can make a cost synergy to me doesn\u2019t sound strategic because that\u2019s one year-over-year, we can have tremendous \u2013 I think that\u2019s an adder if we find a strategic acquisition that fits in our space and we could leverage our supply chain excellence there. Yes. But buying it just because we see a resin advantage, we really are probably looking more is there a strategic advantage that we can have some technology, some competitive advantage to win in the marketplace.", "That said, the size we are looking at in our space is something is an opportunity for us about 400 million that fits in to our businesses can drive our food care business, can drive product care business and has a differentiating technology and definitely that would be something that would be interesting to us. I think bringing our operation of excellence capability to those within just be an exciting synergy that we could make that accretive quicker.", "So we\u2019re looking at it. Yes, we think there are some purchasing power on resin if we were bigger, but our first look is, is it a strategic fit for us and that\u2019s what we would be excited to go after.", "Anthony Pettinari", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Lori Chaitman", "Thanks, Operator?", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on your confidence level on the volume outlook, you face some tough comps in North America food and Europe food as well. And Brazil, New Zealand, Australia there has been some fits and starts there, maybe there's some stabilization, but what your confidence that you will see some nice organic growth in food care?", "William Stiehl", "We put that into our guidance. We did \u2013 the North America has been strong, North America has been leading part of food care. We had that tempered gross rate into her guidance on North America. We don\u2019t see that continuing at that rate, but last year's problem is this year's opportunity, so could we get some correction in Latin American and could we get some correction in Europe. So to the guidance just roughly we see tempered volume for us, and tempered on the acceleration of the volume of the fourth quarter and guidance, but we still think we\u2019ll have nice growth from the product lines and specifically food care going into 2018.", "Arun Viswanathan", "And just follow-up on price, what\u2019s your customers level of acceptance on price increases, are you getting push back, we\u2019re hearing price input cost pressure throughout the chain, so how willing are your customers except that price and has it improved since resin hasn\u2019t gone down as much as you thought? Thanks.", "William Stiehl", "Okay. Well, I\u2019m a couple months expert in the new industry, but I think since our customers are probably listening to the call right now. I don\u2019t think customers are really excited about raising prices. Matter of fact I\u2019ve already had experiences with -- directly with customers now. So that\u2019s partly why we have to really move and the business does a great job on the value capture. Can we save them more money that simply then is not an issue of price to go cash with that.", "Now, as we mentioned that was our input price that our cost were going up, we will raise price. So how I would serve it for the customers living is that we are going to be let down and we want to be at the table. What might be a little bit different going forward is we are going to ask him other questions, because they are going to say for your bag to load our turkey, what\u2019s the price per bag? We might say is there something else in your facility that we can help and save you money. They might be asking us on our Product Care as they would be packaging a product we might say, what are you re-packaging. Can we take some of that cost out and crawl into it?", "So we'll be getting price in a little different area. But the direct question with our customers raising price in this environment of course it\u2019s very difficult. We\u2019ll do it on rising cost but we are going to be much more aggressive and creative on helping them to save money and we think we have opportunities to increase our margins in that value capture strategy and that\u2019s what we are going to be going after.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator, we have time for one last question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Edlain Rodriguez", "Thank you. Good morning. Just one follow up on in terms of acquisitions. I mean, are there any regions in the world that\u2019s most attractive to you, like where would you be reinvest in?", "Ted Doheny", "Good question. We are looking at the regions where we do business. The part of the Fagerdala acquisition that really helped us giving us some presence in the Asia market and that\u2019s because it\u2019s\u2014to help with our cost structure having presence there, that would be attractive to us.", "So, but again we want to be the presence where \u2013 in the markets where our customer are, close to our customers does have attractiveness to us. So there is a geographic play and we just have to look at it, specifically don\u2019t want to give any more clarity at things we are looking at, but we want to be next to our customers, we want to be also in adjacencies that we have some new technology that would help us get into markets. So what would the example be?", "We are pretty strong in the fresh meat market. We are exploring and getting into more of the seafood market. So, those are some adjacencies that make sense. We had some pretty interesting technology in rigid containers. Can we get more into that space? So we are looking for adjacencies where we have an opportunity that if we can\u2019t make it fast enough, maybe there might be a player or a technology in those attractive spaces, we can buy our way in quicker. But the divining rod that we are using is staying really connected to our technologist. And we are looking at all of our product development, can we accelerate that internally or is there a way to accelerate that faster with an M&A opportunity?", "Edlain Rodriguez", "And one quick clarification of the share buybacks. Is there a timeframe that you want to complete, what\u2019s left or is it like open-ended?", "Ted Doheny", "No we typically don\u2019t disclose that as we indicated the guidance assumed 159 million share. We will continue to be active in the market throughout 2018 with our typical methodology that accelerated share repurchase and open market repurchases. But we haven\u2019t indicated a specific timeline at this stage.", "Edlain Rodriguez", "Okay, thank you.", "Lori Chaitman", "Operator that concludes our call today. Thank you everybody for joining. And we look forward to speaking to you again in the near future. Sabrina", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.
