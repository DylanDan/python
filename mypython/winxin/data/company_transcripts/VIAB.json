(NASDAQ:VIAB) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call February  9, 2017  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Jim Bombassei - SVP, IR", "Bob Bakish - President and CEO", "Wade Davis - CFO", "Analysts", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS", "John Janedis - Jefferies", "Alexia Quadrani - JP Morgan", "Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG", "Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities", "Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays", "Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the Viacom First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Teleconference. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us for our December quarter earnings call. Joining me for today\u2019s discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.", "Today\u2019s remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliation for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.", "Bob Bakish", "Thanks, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It\u2019s early days in our effort to chart a new course for Viacom, but I\u2019m happy to say, we made solid initial progress financially and operationally in the first quarter, and we made excellent progress on our go forward strategy.", "Financially, we generated good momentum in the quarter including a return to revenue growth in our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. An increase in affiliate revenue and strength in our international operations drove top line growth in our Media Networks, while a stronger slate at Paramount drove greater returns at the box office. Of course, we still have work to do. Operating income declined in the quarter due largely to increased programming expenses at the networks and marketing costs at Paramount.", "Operationally, we\u2019ve quickly made strides against our most-immediate priorities in my first two months on the job. First, and broadly speaking, we\u2019ve done a lot of work strengthening the management team. With important new leadership announcements across Paramount Pictures, our domestic networks Viacom International Media Networks and U.S. distribution. Second and speaking of U.S. distribution, beginning the work of strengthening our distribution partnerships has been a key area of focus. I\u2019ve been spending time with a number of these clients and the team under new leadership is already at work pursuing broader, more forward thinking partnerships that reinforce the value of the pay TV ecosystem and our brands, and the take advantage of some assets that previously were not part of the equation.", "Third, MTV has been a key focus where already our new leadership is making progress. The new team is working quickly to stabilize the grid and provide a stronger foundation from which to launch new series as it continues to jump start the development pipeline. Fourth, over Paramount, our new COO is now in the lot and we completed an important agreement with Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media, giving Paramount two new strategic partners in China and a deal that we estimate could bring as much as $1 billion of slate funding to the studio. On a related note, I would like to extend a well-deserved word of congratulations to the studio for receiving 18 Oscar nominations for seven of its 2016 releases.", "That said, the financial performance of the studio in that quarter was a significant disappointment. But nevertheless, we will continue to be very focused on strengthening Paramount, particularly as we evolve our strategy; more on that in a bit. Finally, we rapidly unlocked value from our Telefe acquisition, boosting rating significantly with the new Nick Jr. block, driving MTV up in the rankings with a hit new series that airs daily across MTV and Telefe, and bringing a major new consumer product to advertiser to our pay networks.", "As we strengthened our team and attacked our media priorities, I also engaged dozens of our top leaders around the Company to develop an overall go forward strategy for Viacom, a strategy that captures the opportunities we see to better harness the power of our portfolio, strengthen our relationships with our partners, and enhance our ability to create great content, and one that will strengthen the Company overall and return us to growth.", "We presented to and received resounding support from the Viacom Board on that strategy earlier this week, and I want to share with you the highlights today. But before I do, let\u2019s turn it over to Wade for a look at the financials.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks Bob, and good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report our financial results for the December quarter of fiscal 2017 which are highlighted by our progress along certain key operating metrics and initiatives. In the quarter, we returned to revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment and we saw significant improvement in free cash flow generation. We also took steps to extend our near-term maturities to enhance our liquidity profile, and we entered into a multiyear slate financing deal which helps derisk Paramount\u2019s current and future slate and reduce the capital we deploy in the film business.", "In addition, on slide five of our earnings presentation, we have provided a breakdown of Media Networks domestic versus international revenue. So, we hope you find the additional disclosure helpful. With that, I\u2019ll turn to our operating results.", "In terms of consolidated results, Viacom generated revenue of $3.3 billion, a 5% increase over the prior year, and adjusted operating income of $748 million. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.04. Our return to top line growth was driven by growth in domestic affiliate revenues, continued strength at our international operations, and robust theatrical revenues. We also generated operating free cash flow of $113 million in the quarter, an improvement of $265 million versus the prior year.", "Slide four of our web deck provides a financial overview of our Media Networks segment. Revenues for the quarter increased by 1% to $2.6 billion while adjusted operating income declined to $987 million. Worldwide advertising revenues declined 2% while affiliate revenues increased 2% and ancillary revenues increased 20%. Excluding a two-percentage-point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and a one-percentage-point positive impact from the November acquisition of Telefe, worldwide revenues increased 2%.", "Slide five of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks\u2019 domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues largely flat at $2.1 billion, and we had another strong quarter at our international operations as revenues increased by 5% to $534 million. On an organic basis, if we exclude a 13-percentage-point unfavorable foreign currency impact and eight-percentage-point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue grew 10%.", "At our domestic Media Networks business, we saw return to growth in affiliate revenues as well as strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth of 2% in domestic affiliate revenues reflects rate increases and the impact of SVOD and OTT agreements, partially offset by a modest decline in pay TV subscribers. The 10% increase in domestic ancillary revenues was driven by higher home video revenue.", "Domestic advertising declined 3% in the quarter, consistent with our guidance of 500 basis-point sequential improvement. International advertising revenues increased 1% in the quarter. Organically, if we exclude a 15-percentage-point unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a 10-percentage-point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe, international advertising revenues grew 6%, reflecting the continued strength in Europe.", "International affiliate revenues increased 3%. Excluding a 9-percentage-point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 12%. The growth reflects the impact of rate increases, subscriber growth, and new channel launches as well as higher revenues from SVOD and OTT arrangements.", "International ancillary revenues were up 33% due primarily to strong growth in our international consumer products business as well as program sales resulting from our acquisition of Telefe. Growth in consumer products was driven by the strength of our kids\u2019 brands, including Paw Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines.", "Worldwide expenses increased 6% in the quarter; within operating expenses, programming expenses up 6% while distribution and other expense decreased 3%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. Excluding a 2-percentage-point increase attributable to Telefe, worldwide expenses increased 4%. The increase in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by our investment in original programming. The increase in SG&A costs was principally due to the higher incentive compensation accrual.", "Overall, we are pleased with the progress we\u2019re making at Media Networks. With the changes we\u2019ve made so far as well as the strategy for the brands that Bob will outline, we believe that our Media Networks are well-positioned for future growth.", "Now, turning to Paramount. As I mentioned earlier, we have taken steps to derisk the 2017 slate and enhance cash flow through our slate financing. It is a three-year agreement with an option for a fourth with Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media to fund 25% of our slate. This agreement will help us to derisk the entire 2017 slate since it\u2019s retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. The agreement also provides for the potential co-production of Chinese films.", "Now, turning to our results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 24%, principally driven by gains in theatrical and ancillary revenues. Slide six of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased 104% or $192 million due to our current quarter releases, including Jack Reacher: Never Go Back; Ally, Arrival, Office Christmas Party and Fences. Ancillary revenues increased 86% to $78 million, driven by the impact of the film slate financing in the quarter. ", "Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating of loss of $180 million in the quarter, reflecting higher print and advertising costs related to the release of our Q1 fiscal 2017 theatrical releases.", "Now turning to taxes. The adjusted effective tax rate was 30.8% compared to 32.8% in the prior year. This is driven by the mix of domestic and international income. Slide 10 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. For the quarter, we generated $113 million of operating free cash flow, a $265 million improvement versus the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower working capital utilization, reflecting the timing of film and programming spend.", "Now, looking at our debt on slide nine. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.5%. We had $12.3 billion of total debt and $443 million cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 4.1 times.", "During the quarter, we took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. In October, we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due 2022 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to redeem $400 million outstanding of our 2.5% December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our 3.5% April 2017 notes. One of our top priorities is to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize our capital structure to support our long-term strategic initiatives. Accordingly, in terms of capital allocation, we plan to use our excess free cash flow and other actions to delever in order to preserve our investment grade rating.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2017. In terms of advertising, we continue to see strong demand in the scatter market, which bodes well for the upfront. Looking forward, we expect the shift of the Easter holiday into the June quarter of this year will have a negative impact of around 100 basis points on the March quarter domestic ad sales performance. Excluding this impact, we anticipate March quarter domestic ad sales performance would be similar to December quarter.", "As for domestic affiliate revenues, in terms of March quarter, we expect to see revenue growth in the low single digits. For the full year, we continue to expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid to high single digits including factoring in the impact of the acquisition of Telefe.", "For the full year, Media Networks SG&A expense, we expect the organic growth rate will be in the mid single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, reported SG&A expense will grow in the high single digits primarily due to onetime integration costs. Media Networks performance in the December quarter benefitted from the growth in revenues as well as the timing of expenses as certain show launches moved out of the quarter. Accordingly, given the timing of shows coming on air as well as the onetime cost associated with the integration of Telefe, we anticipate programming and SG&A expense growth to be weighted to the March quarter.", "At Filmed Entertainment, our December quarter benefitted from slate financing and the box office performance of certain of our releases. In the March quarter-to-date, some of the box office performance has been somewhat soft; so the benefits we saw in the December quarter will not flow through for the year.", "In terms of taxes, for 2017, we\u2019re forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 31%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.", "Looking forward, we are excited to execute on the strategic plan that Bob will be outlining for you. Changes at Media Networks are already starting to generate early returns. We are focused on returning key revenue streams to growth, improving our earnings, and driving free cash flow generation. We expect to continue to see improvement as we execute on our strategic plan.", "With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Bob.", "Bob Bakish", "Thanks, Wade. Now, let\u2019s get into the strategy. Having undertaking a comprehensive review of our business, we arrived at four underlying needs for Viacom. We need more focus. We have to align the Company against areas where we can have the greatest impact. We need to be distinct. Our brands, content and culture must truly be unique and differentiated. We need to unlock the benefits of our scale. We need to better harness the power of our portfolio and grow our competitive strength. And finally, we need to be more adaptable. We need to flex the market shifts, create new opportunities, and strengthen partnerships.", "With these in mind, we\u2019ve established a new five-point strategic plan. We will, one, put the full power of Viacom behind six flagship brands; two, revitalize and elevate our approach to content and talent development; three deepen partnerships to drive traditional revenue streams; four, make big moves in the digital world and the physical world; and five, continue to optimize and energize our organization.", "First, let\u2019s talk about flagship brands: A strategic shift we are making to better allocate resources and capture broader opportunities for our brands with the biggest upside. So, what constitutes a flagship brand? A flagship brand must have a compelling, valuable and distinct brand promise; it must resonate with the target audience or in a genre that is big enough to matter; it must have a rich offering comprised largely of wholly-owned content; it must be global; and it must have the ability to deliver at for points of distribution, linear television, digital, off channel, and theatrical. So, here are the flagship six: Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Paramount. I am excited to say, we will bring a set of our TV brands to film and our film brand to TV in a major way.", "With regards to the first part, TV brands to film. We plan for each of our flagship brands to contribute 1 to 2 cobranded films to the Paramount slate each year with the brand and the studio working collaboratively to source and develop projects for the studio to ultimately green light. As we do all this, note that a significant part of the slate will remain under the Paramount brand with the focus on franchises and tentpoles among other projects.", "Let\u2019s look at this approach through the lens of Nickelodeon, a case study of what a flagship brand looks like when firing on all cylinders. The network has firmly established its dominance on TV with kids, finishing the 2016 calendar year as a number one network for kids and basic cable\u2019s top entertainment network. Nick was number one in the December quarter with every major kids demo, 2 to 11, 2 to 5, and 6 to 11 where it notched its first win in more than five years, and it shows no signs of slowing down, with the content pipeline of more than 650 episodes a year, almost entirely wholly-owned, highly exportable content across live action, animation and pre-school. All of that IP sees a multi-billion dollar consumer products business at retail and a growing stable of live tours and events. And as part of our new strategy, I am pleased to announce that Nickelodeon and Paramount are moving forward on a new slate of four films through 2020 that will leverage existing and introduce new Nickelodeon IP.", "The first of these films, Amusement Park, an animated feature with Jennifer Garner and Mila Kunis will premier in theatres in summer of 2018 and it will get a TV series on Nick, the following year. And there are additional films including those associated with existing Nickelodeon franchises right behind it.", "So, the strategy is not just an idea, we are already moving on it, and know that we are currently putting a structure in place to operationalize this approach across our flagship brands and the studio.", "I am also excited to announce that we will be bringing the Paramount brand to TV in a big way by rebranding our U.S. Spike Network in 2018 as the Paramount Network. Adopting the Paramount name and fortifying its programming is a natural way for Spike to strengthen its position as a major general entertainment network which will enhance our adult audience delivery and enable us to grow this important sector of the ad market.", "Internationally, we\u2019ve been very successful in capitalizing on the marquee Paramount brand to offer general entertainment channels that feature high-quality programming, movies and documentaries. In fact, the Paramount channel is already the largest ad supported movie channel in the world.", "Now, I want to be clear that Viacom has some very important and high-performing brands beyond the flagship six, branded networks that hold strong positions in their categories and maintaining diverse and loyal followings. They will not go away, but they don\u2019t necessarily have global or theatrical potential, and they won\u2019t benefit from an increased resource commitment. We see these as reinforcing brands. And VH1, Logo, TV Land, and CMT have already been realigned within our organization to reinforce the flagship six.", "Moving to our next strategic point, maximizing our approach to content and talent development. Historically, Viacom\u2019s brands were set up and operated in a very distributed siloed manner. In the past decade, we\u2019ve inched towards a more holistic approach, but have never fully committed to it in the way we must to be successful in this environment. So, we are going to change that, beginning by prioritizing investment to the flagship six, then sharpening creative filters and program and to make sure the brands remain distinct and complementary, accelerating global opportunities and implementing a more holistic approach to scheduling, marketing and digital. As we do that, we will increase the volume of originals and push more aggressively into new format and life. And we want to share ideas more aggressively across borders for our flagship brands. Nickelodeon is already very established in this model, and MTV is moving quickly with MTV U.S. now developing several MTV U.K. formats.", "We also need to transform the way we work with talent. We need to do a much better job of keeping our homegrown talent in the Viacom ecosystem, creating new opportunities for our starts across networks and at Paramount with our new branded film slates. Comedy Central is launching 10 new series this year, more than it ever has, representing the biggest influx of new talent to the brand since it introduced the likes of Amy Schumer and Key & Peele.", "We are acutely focused on providing divorce opportunities for this talent to create and grow their careers under our roof. Trevor Noah is a great example. The daily show lapped the year on a ratings high with its most watched and highest rated quarter ever for Trevor among total viewers and adults 18 to 49. We are collaborating across our portfolio to drive greater growth to Trevor, harnessing greater support from our domestic networks and localizing the format internationally.", "Our third strategic area of focus is deepening partnerships to drive traditional revenue streams. To drive the scale, strength and flexibility we need, we need to emphasize partnership more than this Company ever has. With the traditional MVPDs, we are focused on cultivating true strategic partnerships that reposition our brands and push the industry forward, rather than the transactional relationships restricted to zero sum economic negotiation. To that end, we are focused on leveraging our data, products, ad sales, and marketing expertise to help grow their businesses. We will also reinforce the pay TV ecosystem by being highly selective in striking agreements with over the top distributors, confining those deals to largely library content. We do want to support the success of virtual MVPDs, as we have with partners like Sling and DIRECTV Now, and embrace their roles as catalyst for innovation.", "In ad sales, we\u2019ll build up our leadership in data-driven products and branded entertainment, but we will also create more value through tighter alignment across the portfolio. For instance, we are heading into the upfront with the most comprehensive cross-portfolio package Viacom has ever offered, a product we call Epic. It spans 9 networks, 20 tentpoles and 60 returning series.", "Moving on to the fourth point, we are going to make big moves in the digital and the physical world. In digital, short-form video has clearly emerged as a dominant medium. And because it is video, it is an area where we have inherent strength and capabilities. But like another areas, our lack of a holistic unified approach to short-form content development and distribution, has held up back. To fix this, we are creating a new business unit focused on producing short-form content, both original IP and leveraging our brands. We will aggressively grow short-form output at our flagship brands for distribution by both our owned and operated, as well as third party platforms. This will allow Viacom to better serve increasing demand from our advertisers for this kind of inventory and better support our brands.", "We also want to create more and stronger expressions of our brands in the physical world. This is a necessary and valuable tool for marketing, talent development and extending our consumer connections, and it is an incremental business. Take MTV outside the U.S. for example. Last year, over 1 million people went to an MTV event. That\u2019s great for the brand, and we made money doing it, and we\u2019re working to expand and grow this business.", "Comedy Central in the U.S., for example, will enter the festival space this summer in partnership with Superfly, the company behind Bonnaroo. This is a big opportunity for Comedy Central to grow its standing as a dominant comedy brand in the U.S., and it creates greater opportunities for Comedy Central\u2019s roster of emerging standup comedians, many of whom moved into our development pipeline with new series.", "We also think there is a big opportunity to grow Bellator. And rebranding Spike to the Paramount Network will help us capitalize on that. Taken together, we believe these digital and physical opportunities represent important incremental revenue streams, and they reinforce our brand and IP.", "And fifth and finally, we are continuing to optimize and energize our organization. We are rethinking our operations to allow for better collaboration across our portfolio as well as more holistic relationships with our partners. And as we do this, we have the opportunity to realign the organization to build future growth.", "We are also very-focused on culture, and establishing a shared vision and values that elevate the very best of what Viacom has offered in its proud successful history. It\u2019s a history that I am confident we will build on. By staying focused as a portfolio but flexible in our approach to the market, we will build scale, be even more competitive, and evolve Viacom into the premier portfolio of global multi-platform entertainment brands.", "As we do, we\u2019ll be focused on driving growth and earnings and free cash flow as key metrics of our progress, and on delivering value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support.", "And with that, let me turn it over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks so much. Bob, you covered a lot of ground. I probably have 20 or 30 questions. So, why don\u2019t I just start with one high level and leave it to others. What do you see as the biggest execution hurdles in this revitalization strategy laid out?", "Bob Bakish", "Thanks, Doug. I think the reality is we now have a clear path forward, which we as a management team, are absolutely convinced will create value and competitive advantage for the Company. That said, there are a lot of pieces we have to execute on. And whether that\u2019s putting in place a new structure at Paramount to enable the expansion or really the development of the brand, the film slate, whether that\u2019s moving quickly with the Paramount Network rebrands, whether that\u2019s implementing a new approach in terms of our distribution strategy and relationships, it really does come down to a set of execution. But, I believe we have the team in place; and obviously, we\u2019ll continue to look to supplement that team to get the work done. And again, it is an executable plan, and it is -- we are not focused on creating some new unknown thing. We just need to execute, and I\u2019m confident we can do it.", "Doug Mitchelson", "If I can just follow up with how long do you think before you believe the Company will really hit to stride over this plan?", "Bob Bakish", "What I\u2019ve been focused on since day one is forward movement in the Company, and that will absolutely remain a focus. Now some things can happen relatively quickly, some things take a little more time. For example, a film from the day it\u2019s conceived to the day it releases, you look at it like 2, 2.5 years. So that does take some time. Thankfully, we have some Nickelodeon products already in the pipeline that we could all get behind and move on. Other things will happen more quickly. I continue to be pleased with the MTV U.S. journey for example. And if you look at what\u2019s going on there, clearly, we\u2019ll be talking about a whole new slate in the upfront; that we\u2019ll be launching in the fourth fiscal quarter. So, that is a much more nearer term opportunity. But again, overall, you can think of that as a steady march towards a revitalized Viacom, and you will see continued progress.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thank you, very interesting.", "Wade Davis", "From a financial perspective, you can expect to see strong growth in the second half of the year. So, a lot of things that Bob\u2019s talked about strategies that are underway, you\u2019ll start to see reflected in the -- or you will continue to see reflected in the financial performance.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Thank you. Bob, can you talk a little bit more about the rebrand to the Paramount, I guess network. How much of an incremental investment should we expect, and what kind of window does it provide to attract new advertisers or categories? And then, I guess more broadly, as you know, domestic Media Networks have an under margin pressure. Based on the new strategy, can you talk maybe more about the path forward in terms of margin improvement?", "Bob Bakish", "Sure. So, let me start by saying that the strategy overall from a financial standpoint on the cost base is about prioritization and remix. So, on a total Company basis or total Media Networks basis, we are not talking about a significant increase in aggregate spending. Now, going to the Paramount Network in particular, Paramount Network will benefit from an increased commitment of resources within Media Networks. That will enable a couple of things. One, but fundamentally, will enable a stronger program in slate including original production. However, I want to note that one of the inherent appeals of this strategy is one of benefitting from scale. In other words, scripted programming will be a significant part of the Paramount Network slate as it comes to life in 2018. It will benefit from a concentration of some of the scripted stuff we\u2019ve been doing on across the house. So, that\u2019s one of the things you will see.", "Spike, soon to be rebranded the Paramount Network, already has a significant amount of film product on it, and we already as Viacom, have a significant amount of Paramount product under license, but we\u2019re going to be moving some stuff around. So that -- and the last thing I would say about the Paramount Network is, today what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re announcing our going forward strategy. We\u2019re actually -- we communicated to the Board on Monday, I am communicating it via Facebook Live to all employees later today. So, there is a small group of people that are aware of the Paramount Network strategy but really starting today is when we do the detailed work on bringing that what I believe, great general entertainment network to life. And so, there will be -- we will be building that plan; you\u2019ll be learning more; we\u2019ll be talking about it in the marketplace and obviously driving towards a rebrand as we said, in 2018, early 2018.", "As for the broader Media Networks, the other part of your question, again, the strategy is about emphasizing these flagship brands where we believe there is incremental opportunity, not only within their traditional media network space but beyond that will benefit the P&L. And we will shift some resources around from the reinforcing networks. But in aggregate, again, there won\u2019t be an increase in spending.", "I don\u2019t know, Wade, if you want to add anything?", "Wade Davis", "Yes. I think the question about margin expansion and when we\u2019ll begin to see that. We\u2019re going to be continuing to invest in effecting the strategy that Bob described. In particular, there are going to be programming investments and shifts into Q3 and Q4. So, we had set those investments to start paying off, and you\u2019ll start to see margin expansion in the fourth quarter.", "Bob Bakish", "And just sorry, the other thing you did ask about was the ad category impact, if you will, relationship with Paramount Network. If you look at Spike, it has a, I\u2019ll call it, a GE type ad base. So, it has relationships and spending from a range of clients. However, because the Paramount Network will up our general entertainment gain including ultimately deliver larger audiences, it\u2019s a key path forward for expanding our share of the adult market. And we believe that\u2019s an important growth driver for Media Networks and therefore Viacom.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Hi. Thank you, and thanks Bob for all that color, and congratulations; nice to see such a positive turn in results here. Just sort of following up on your comments on the flagship six brands and the rebranding of Spike, have you discussed sort of this new strategy with the distributors? I think you just said you\u2019re sort of early days in this announcement, but I wanted to know if that\u2019s something you guys do ahead of time or is that just something you address when the renewals come up for at a later date? And then I have a follow-up.", "Bob Bakish", "Sure. Alexia, the answer is yes. We started conversations with our distributors early this week. In fact, I had a conversation with a CEO of one of the largest MVPDs, last Friday, and I talked about this strategic move. It\u2019s important to note that from a contractual standpoint, there are no issues with this. It is a rebrand of Spike, the definition of Spike includes movies and the likes. There is no contractual problems, but we wanted to talk -- we wanted our key clients to hear from us first, and that\u2019s what we did. We also by the way had conversations with many agencies and some key advertising accounts over the last two days, and we have gotten very positive feedback on this strategic move.", "Alexia Quadrani", "And then, just a follow-up on the affiliate growth, I think you highlighted SVOD and OTT helping drive the domestic affiliate growth, I think maybe total. Can you elaborate, I guess on how significant those deals are? And in general, what is your strategy you\u2019re thinking going forward about further SVOD deals?", "Wade Davis", "So, from an overall affiliate standpoint, we expect low to mid single digit growth for the full year. We also expect the growth rate to -- again, consistent with some of the other trends in the business, see a slight compression from where we are in the first quarter and then really an acceleration in the second half of the year that will land us in that kind of low to mid single digit range. SVOD is not going to be a significant part of our affiliate revenue, as it has been in the past. And so, again, we feel very confident in that level of growth and those dynamics.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thank you. Good morning. Bob, have you had a chance, and maybe if not, how are you thinking about new virtual and MVPDs and your new network strategy? And I guess what I\u2019m thinking is, does it -- are you considering the idea and is it an opportunity to sort of bring six core networks to new streaming platforms in a way that you -- this changes relationship with your distribution partners and creates maybe a better opportunity for Viacom to participate in some of those platforms and at least I think the consensus, as you -- Viacom is not participating? Just curious how the rebrand may affect you thinking on new platforms, as you move forward, if it\u2019s significant?", "Bob Bakish", "Yes. I think it\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019ve thought about a lot in terms of the context for developing the strategy. And I think the point is actually bigger than what you suggest, which is if you think about the impact of OTT on the market, on an international basis, you can argue that given current pay TV penetration levels, OTT should be a positive catalyst for growth in penetration and reach. In the U.S., it\u2019s hard to make that argument. In fact, the more likely outcome and one outcome that I think is increasingly talked about is, it\u2019s a negative impact on price at different tiers of opportunities come to market for consumers. As that happens, there is a very compelling market opportunity in the development of an entertainment pack. And if you look at the flagship six, the flagship six is essentially the strongest entertainment pack you could get in the market, because you have preschool, kids, young adults, you have comedy, you\u2019ve got African-Americans and you\u2019re going to have a general marquee general entertainment network. And if you look at viewing shares and the like, that\u2019s a very significant cornerstone.", "And so, I believe ultimately, the market will embrace that. Now, if you look at the UK as an example where big basic essentially doesn\u2019t exist, Sky runs packs. And you look at pack penetration, what you will see is that sports penetration is 52%, which actually is higher than I thought it would be. Entertainment pack penetration is 100%. And so, you look at the evolution of the market going forward, probably with MVPDs as a catalyst but with -- probably the MVPDs -- OTT plays as a catalyst, but ultimately MVPD is not far behind, it\u2019s hard to imagine that you don\u2019t see the emergence of this entertainment pack tier. And I think the flagship brands are ideally suited to ensure that Viacom greatly benefits from that development.", "Ben Swinburne", "Makes sense. And then, I\u2019ll just ask Wade a couple of quick follow-ups. But on your comment on the affiliate revenue, where I think you suggested that the March quarter would be slower than the December quarter. Was that a worldwide or domestic comment? I just wanted to ask if you could clarify. And then, could you just help us, what was the impact of the co-financing agreement in the quarter? I think you said ancillary revenues. Did it have any benefit to working capital in the quarter? When you talk about derisking 2017, maybe be a little more specific about what that means financially for us. Thanks.", "Wade Davis", "From an affiliate standpoint, my comment was really related to domestic. On a worldwide basis, we\u2019re going to be flat going into the second quarter. And so, obviously, it\u2019s going to be slightly higher growth internationally to offset the slightly lower growth domestically. I am sorry. Can you just repeat the question about working capital?", "Ben Swinburne", "Yes. You guys have generally talked about this co-financing deal at Paramount, derisking the slate. And I think you mentioned the ancillary revenues in the quarter benefitted from the financing. I think we\u2019re all looking for a little more specifics on how that agreement impacts the numbers, both in the quarter but just maybe generally for the year, even if it\u2019s directionally, is it helping free cash flow?", "Wade Davis", "It\u2019s going to significantly help free cash flow. In fact, the overall picture at Paramount with respect to free cash flow is impressive. The combination of the films -- the slate financing activities that we were able to execute, plus strong spend management, you\u2019re going to see an unwind of the cash loses from last year and a return to positive cash flow in that segment. So, that\u2019s a change of well over $1 billion in free cash flow. So, it\u2019s not just the slate financing but is driving the improvement in free cash flow at Paramount because we are very-focused on this and undertaking a number of other actions.", "In terms of the impact in the quarter, it had a positive -- as we noted around ancillary revenues, it had a positive impact on ancillary revenues, as well as operating income, but not really much of an impact on cash in the quarter.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. ", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the last question about virtual MVPs and kind of what you call entertainment bundles. Some of your peers that I listen to, someone like Disney\u2019s Chairman, Bob Iger, they talk to with the every bundle that\u2019s going to be created, smaller bundles being focused around sports and that you can\u2019t have a bundle without sports. Do you think we\u2019re going to have a non-sports bundle at the low prices and high value that you\u2019ve mentioned during 2017? And, what do you think the catalyst is for that to actually come about? I mean, is there a leading candidate who might actually launch one of those that you\u2019re talking to? And then, just in terms of programming, I think your head of scripted programming in MTV left; you expanded your relationship with the Jersey Shore creators. It seems like there is a meaningful shift away from scripted towards reality. I would just love to better understand your thinking there and what are you trying to accomplish and why?", "Bob Bakish", "Sure, Rich. So, to your first question, I believe they will absolutely become an entertainment pack. Whether that will launch in 2017 or not, we\u2019ll see. There\u2019s lots of conversations going around. I\u2019m not going to name check any particular companies, but certainly there is activity in the marketplace.", "On your question of MTV and its shift, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve talked about this in some other forums. But, MTV U.S. embarked on a very heavy scripted programming strategy some years back versus MTV international did not for a variety of reasons. Ultimately, the scripted strategy for MTV on a large scale basis didn\u2019t really work. And there is no question that under Chris\u2019s -- Chris McCarthy\u2019s leadership -- he is bringing back a better balance to MTV including a real push on reality, which is very attractive to the audience, has very compelling economics for us and is really right from a brand filter perspective too. At the same time, there are other elements of the MTV story. Music is another element of the MTV story, and live is going to be a third element of the MTV story. We have recently started to do some live packaging of our franchises on MTV on the weekends. And that live rollout will continue because we see a real opportunity and we are getting good early traction from a ladies and audience perspective. The last thing I would say is that as we do these three things, scripted is not going to go away, it still has a place on the grid with the brand, if you will, but it\u2019s just the balance is going to shift.", "Richard Greenfield", "And does it shift into things, I mean like you\u2019re seeing syndication pulling out something like Friends, which seems to skew you a bit more female than probably MTV has been in while? Do you think you end up syndicating content or using syndicated content as a way to be in the scripted business more than developing the content yourself?", "Bob Bakish", "So, couple of things. One is, when I talk to Chris about Friends, I was a little skeptical initially, but he showed me the research that actually the demographic is very -- has a strong connection to the show, and it\u2019s working well for us. It is also, just to be clear, a bridge strategy. We needed to reset MTV in a variety of ways and we saw an opportunity to take a lot of episodes of a show that\u2019s out there that had appealed to our target consumers from a research perspective and use it, which we are. Friends is now -- there is two other hours of Friends, I think from 6 to 8 on MTV and that\u2019s working well. But, it\u2019s also a bridge to get us time to implement a news slate of shows, which Chris and the team are actively working on and will begin coming to air in fiscal Q4.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.", "Michael Morris", "Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, you just mentioned Chris McCarthy\u2019s work over at MTV. He had success at VH1. And I think part of the success that I have heard you reference before is the use of data from your set-top box relationships and things like that to inform programming decisions. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit. Is that a factor that\u2019s a new factor in your confidence in getting the right programming in front of the right people and how does that actually work? And then my second question is on the film financing partnership. If you could share anymore details. By all accounts, it looks like a great situation for the Company, as you look to move forward in that segment. But, I would assume, you have to give something up in order to strike that partnership. So, how should investors be thinking of whether you gave up upside or whether it\u2019s particular markets that perhaps you don\u2019t participate in anymore? Thanks.", "Bob Bakish", "Yes. So, to your first question, just to be clear, scheduling is about data and analysis, in a way always has been. And so, what we\u2019re seeing is a continued evolution of bringing facts to the table, if you will, to improve scheduling decisions. So, the comment is really about scheduling the network. It\u2019s not about program development; whether it\u2019s set-top boxes or any other kind of data, so just to be clear. And your second question, I am not sure I fully understood the question. Can you just recap it?", "Michael Morris", "Sure, absolutely. So, in order to strike the film partnership, you have a cash infusion or financing infusion\u2026", "Bob Bakish", "Okay, I get the question. So, you mean the slate financing deal?", "Michael Morris", "Exactly.", "Bob Bakish", "So, what it is, it\u2019s -- we essentially sold 25% interest in the slate; it\u2019s a multi-year deal, to these two entities. And therefore, they participate in the economic return on the film. They did not buy a set of markets or something like that which you might -- I mean, yes, there are deals like that typically in the television space and also the film space, but that\u2019s not what this is. This is selling the 25% interest in the slate.", "Michael Morris", "And so, it\u2019s a situation where should the films outperform, that\u2019s where your upside is limited versus not participating in let\u2019s say the Chinese market for example?", "Wade Davis", "No. We expect, in some instances get some operational and distribution benefit through our partnership with these entities. This is, as Bob said, this is an outright sale of the 25% interest in the entire slate with a couple of exceptions.", "Bob Bakish", "For example, we as Viacom still participate in the economic value created from these films in China. And actually, we believe this deal enhances that potential value, given the strategic presence of these companies in that market. But we didn\u2019t sell them the China window; we sold them essentially a global participation in the film.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.", "Kannan Venkateshwar", "Thank you. Bob, just a question on the bottom channels outside the top six. Is there an opportunity on the cost side near-term to optimize the cost base? And if you could give us some sense of what that opportunity looks like, that would be great. And secondly, just wanted to clarify a point on the Paramount cash flow turnaround; $1 billion, I may have missed this, $1 billion, is it over the period of the financing deal or is this over a shorter or longer timeframe? It would be great if you would clarify that, Wade? Thanks.", "Bob Bakish", "Yes. $1 billion is over a term, it\u2019s three years or so; we draw it as we need it. And Wade, I don\u2019t know\u2026", "Wade Davis", "I am sorry. Just to clarify, there might be some confusion, because we\u2019ve got two $1 billion numbers bouncing around. So, what Bob just was referring to is what we believe the amount of funding, financing that we\u2019ll receive out of this agreement over the three-year term. What I referenced was over a $1 billion of year-over-year improvement by the end of this fiscal year, in Paramount\u2019s free cash flow. So, the two things are somewhat related. And as much as some of the $1 billion from the slate financing is coming into this year and improving some amount of Paramount\u2019s free cash flow year-over-year, but I want to be very clear that that\u2019s not the only element that is driving the improvement of over a$1 billion in year-over-year cash flow improvement upcoming.", "Bob Bakish", "And then, to your first question on the reinforcing networks, I would say a couple of things. One is, again, there are strong networks that are included in this category, networks like TV Land, like CMT, VH1 that have real prospects going forward. They are not though global prospects; they are not film prospects, hence the segmentation. As we implement the flagship six strategy, we will be looking at resources, and we will do some inevitable shift in resources. But again, you should not interpret this as a light switch move of a whole bunch of networks going away, because that\u2019s not what this is about. This is about focusing resources to drive the highest possible performance of these flagship six plans, both on a consumer connection level, which benefits -- which is driven by multi-platform exposure and increased content commitment et cetera. But, it\u2019s not a light switch turning off a whole bunch of networks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our final question from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Instinet.", "Anthony DiClemente", "Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about, again, the flagship six, kind of a follow-up on that strategy, and the implications for that in terms of negotiations with your distributors. Bob, you said it a second ago that it\u2019s not a light switch for those to be kind of shutting down. But, over time, over a longer period of time, is the idea that as the value proposition improves for the flagship six, that affiliate fees for those networks specifically will go up? It\u2019s, I guess, hard to argue that affiliates use per network for like a VH1 will go up, if you\u2019re deemphasizing that. So, I just wanted to get the long-term economic implications of the flagship six strategy with your affiliate agreements.", "Bob Bakish", "Yes. So, look, it\u2019s very early days to get into a very specific financial discussion around how components of the P&L may evolve over the next X years. Suffice it to say, we believe the strategy strengthens Viacom\u2019s position across a range of considerations on a going forward basis. We believe it will, among other things, benefit our distribution clients by making these brands stronger and having their consumers serve even better. And by the way, by having these non-television attributes, it also provides us opportunities to work with our distribution clients in different ways. For example, as Nickelodeon has this increasing life in the physical world, there is an opportunity for subscribers to MVPDs, either on a Sweepstakes or some other basis to enjoy those experiences. As you get into film business, there is opportunities for consumers of pay TV to get some unique experiences. So, there is a variety of opportunities that are a function of this strategy. And again, our overall focus with respect to distribution -- and that seems to be at the core of your question, is now working to broaden and strengthen our partnership with these very important clients.", "Wade Davis", "Just to follow up on the economics. Historically, we\u2019ve really always gotten paid for the portfolio. And this is a move that\u2019s designed to strengthen the portfolio. These networks, as Bob said, are not going to go away; they are going to move into supporting roles, helping to strengthen the flagship six which we think again is going to strengthen the portfolio and create more opportunities. And just to reference what Bob said earlier, as we move potentially towards entertainment packs and products like that, this will be a must have element, cornerstone of the entertainment viewership in the pay TV landscape. So, again, it\u2019s really about the portfolio as a whole, portfolio management, and we\u2019re confident that that\u2019s going to be a better value proposition overall.", "Bob Bakish", "And just to add one other sort of element to the discussion, a number people have asked me, why did CMT and TV Land move under Spike, now the Paramount Network? And the answer is very simple which is all three of those networks have pretty balanced male, female audiences targeted adult demographics and therefore, we believe can benefit in terms of co-management. And that\u2019s another example of our assets being a way to support the flagship six. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all the other things get rebranded to flagship six. I don\u2019t want anyone to think that. But it means, working as a portfolio to reinforce an overall strategy that will strengthen our position, again, across a variety of dimensions.", "Jim Bombassei", "We want to thank everybody for joining us for our earnings call.", "Bob Bakish", "Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our September quarter earnings call. Listening from Los Angeles is our Chairman, Sumner Redstone, and joining us in New York are Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page number two in the Web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2015's fourth quarter and full fiscal year.", "We are seeing real progress as the ecosystem adapts and coalesces around innovative new models both in distribution and advertising in the U.S. and around the world. We believe these changes will usher in a new period of prosperity and growth, but also know that success will require a focus on a long-term health and vitality of our business.", "More than ever, this is a great time to be in the content business and those with a more long-term view that is currently in vogue will be richly rewarded. Viacom continue to take a leadership role in capturing the opportunities that are rapidly taking shape. We are effectively adapting to a digital on-demand socially driven global marketplace even as we demonstrate quantifiable success in achieving our strategy goals. Importantly, we are also accelerating the critical initiatives that are driving improvements throughout the company.", "First, I will recap our financial performance in the quarter and the year and share some operational and strategic highlights. Tom and Wade will go to greater detail on the results in a moment.", "In the fourth quarter, revenues declined 5% to $3.79 billion, adjusted operating income was $1.06 billion and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $614 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 10% to a $1.54 per diluted share. For the year, revenues were $13.27 billion a decline of 4%. Adjusted operating income totaled $3.92 billion and adjusted net earnings from continuing operation were $2.21 billion. Full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1% to $5.44, which was an all time record for the company.", "Viacom continue to generate substantial free cash and return $2.1 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends. As planned, we resumed share repurchases last month at a relatively modest pace thus far, as we focused on growth initiatives while maintaining a strong financial position.", "Looking back at the quarter and the full-year Viacom continue to execute on our top strategic priority, investing in content especially original content for all technologies, building international scale capabilities and profitability and expanding the use of data and technology in advertising, distribution and the viewer experience to derive additional value from our brands.", "As I said earlier, our industry has been moving through a period that has challenged established patterns of media consumption and measurement of that consumption, because of our young audiences and highly focused brands, Viacom experienced the changes early in the cycle and across more of our properties than other media companies.", "That transition has now taken a hold across the industry, creating disruption, but also spurring action and real momentum towards solution. As the early birds, we see that as platforms expand and opportunities increase fully measured consumption becomes even stronger. In fact, recent research revealed that young people are spending more time consuming media each day than they do sleeping. So apparently, media executives aren\u2019t the only ones losing sleep in this modern world.", "I'm pleased to say that at Viacom we are starting to turn the corner. Once again, in the quarter the Viacom family of networks was number one according to Nielsen for people two plus, people 18 to 34, people 18 to 49 and people 2 to 49 that's a lot of people. Ratings are improving at key networks like Nickelodeon, Nick at Night, TV land, BET, CMT and VH1 with additional improvement expected at our other networks as new programming kicks in.", "Our investment in data is producing meaningful, incremental revenue and the benefits of digital distribution continue to develop and grow. As other companies now begin their pivot through the transition, many of our media networks brands are already beginning to emerge, well positioned to grow and succeed.", "Turning to the media networks result, revenues increased 5% to $2.79 billion in the quarter, affiliate revenues remain strong up 15% domestically and 10% worldwide in the quarter. For the year, domestic displayed revenues increased 8% and worldwide revenues were up 5%. We expect continued high single-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenue in fiscal 2016.", "With the renewal of our AT&T agreement at the end of the quarter, we concluded a year in which we successfully renewed affiliate deals covering close to 20% of our distribution. In addition, we closed an unprecedented Hulu deal in September that provides outstanding value for our programming while supporting the vitality of the overall distribution ecosystem.", "On the advertising sales front, we delivered sequential improvement in quarterly domestic advertising revenue growth with a decline of 7% improved from a 9% decline in Q3. While it is still early in the quarter, we expect continuing improvement in domestic ad sales this quarter which we expect to accelerate further as our fiscal year progresses. Worldwide, the decline in the fourth quarter was 1%, for the year, worldwide advertising revenues increased 1%.", "Once again, advertising revenues substantially outpaced traditional rating as we continue to provide significant value-added offering to marketing partners and we continue to deepen our value proposition to partners offering deep social connection to our Viacom Echo platform. A key component of Viacom's next generation advertising portfolio is Vantage, our bet on sophisticated data that leverages our leadership in analytics and data aggregation for the benefit of marketing partners. It is a proven success and a platform that is in great demand among the largest and most sophisticated advertisers.", "Currently, we have 11 advertisers using Vantage, leading national advertisers across sectors that include automotive, beverages, consumer goods, financial services and quick service restaurants. We are in discussions with dozens of additional Fortune 500 partners. Demand is strong and building. We anticipate that we will triple the total number of Vantage deals by next year's upfront representing a significant portion of our advertising revenue base.", "Many of our peers are beginning their own data program, the market is moving rapidly in this direction led by sophisticated national advertisers, this is good for the ecosystem and will create more demand. We are confident that Viacom will remain in the forefront as we continue to evolve and improve our proprietary products. Our brands remain powerful, our creative and technical talent is unmatched and our exclusive relationships cannot be replicated like the TiVo partnership we announced just last week.", "In addition, we have in the last few weeks taking a significant ownership stake in DigiTour, a leading live events provider for social media talent with many partnership opportunities across our brands. We are deeply committed to keeping our leadership in this area and firmly believe that as others catch up, we will already be executing on the next generation of these high margin, highly sophisticated programs for our marketing partners.", "Of course all of this continued improvement depends on great content and our Neo networks are delivering more new original programming than ever before for every class. Nickelodeon is a prime example of the success of this commitment. The network delivered a strong fourth quarter by launching innovative new shows and increasing the volume of high quality premiers. Throughout the quarter, Nickelodeon had more than a 100 new episodes of preschool and kid content with positive results.", "Paw Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines are preschool hits with live-plus-three ratings for premiers exceeding a 10. Saturday nights, now host two new hits, Henry Danger which was the number one live action show for kids 2 to 11 in the fourth quarter and Game Shakers, which has become a number one live action show in recent weeks. Game Shakers also plays cross platform with its Sky Whale game already generating 3 million downloads since its September launch.", "August marked Nick's highest rated month of the year with kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11. By September, Nick had taken a strong lead over its nearest competitor and has continued that trend into the current where Nickelodeon will premier 140 new episodes and event programs in the Hard Eight.", "In digital, the Nick Jr. app and Noggin are all expanding their reach. The Nick has surpassed has surpassed 20 million installed across iOS, Android, Xbox and Roku and the Nick Jr. app has surpassed 2 million installs with kids spending over 100 minutes per week within the app. Noggin continues to perform well and will be available on android and internationally for the first time beginning next week.", "VH1 is another success story, with new leadership in place the network increased total day ratings 6% over the fourth quarter 2014 driven by its strong Monday lineup. For the quarter VH1 was the number one cable network on Monday nights among women 18 to 49 and number three among all adults 18 to 49 fueled by the Love & Hip Hop Franchise.", "The Season 4 Finale of VH1\u2019s Love and Hip Hop at lined up was the number one telecast on all television for the day among women 18 to 49 and women 18 to 34. The episode was also the number one cable telecast among adults 18 to 49 delivering a 2.3 rating in that demo and over 3.3 million total viewers.", "And combined with the evenings two encore airings more than 5.3 million total viewers tuned in for the Season 4 Finale. In the current quarter, VH1 is continuing to roll with October prime time ratings up 33%. VH1 owns Monday nights as the number one non-sport cable network for women 18 to 49.", "BET delivered sequential improvement in ratings growth in the fourth quarter with a top two sitcoms on all basic cable for the key 18 to 49 demo, The Game and Real Husbands of Hollywood and the network delivered on their all new reboot of the classic MTV series Punk'd making it the third highest rated BET series in the quarter.", "In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, BET is driving even more ratings growth, quickly bringing more quality and more volume to the schedule. The Being Mary Jane season three premier was Tuesday night top scripted program on cable this season among adults 18 to 49 and the Westbrook's is already becoming a new reality hit.", "We are also looking forward to Centric's Soul Train Awards at the end of this month which is a proven viewership tempo and much like the widely successful BET experience the Soul Train Awards continues to build a scale of its weekend long live event, reinforcing connections with fans and creating unprecedented marketing opportunities for our advertising partners.", "At MTV we've also installed new leadership, Sean Atkins joined us in October, he is an accomplished, versatile media executive who brings excellent management skills and creative experience across developing low cost development, production and digital products. He has hit the ground running and we expect to see significant improvement at MTV in fiscal 2016.", "Despite traditional rating challenges, the MTV brand maintains its prowess and vitality, engaging with young audience in more and deeper ways than ever. The recent Video Music Awards is a great example, the show attracted 10 million viewers on air and more than 76 million video views across platforms in the first three days including 12 million views on Snapchat. This show had generated over 0.5 billion social impressions and also set a new record for Tweets during an entertainment program.", "To kick off our second fiscal quarter MTV is returning some of its biggest hits and bring highly anticipated new series to air including new seasons of Teen Mom OG and Teen Wolf as well as the epic fantasy drama The Shannara Chronicles.

Trevor has exceeded our expectations and has already built an audience that is younger, more digital and more diverse. Over the first four weeks, Trevor grew linear viewing among adults 18 to 24 by 20% and men 18 to 24 by 32% and the program remains the number one late night show in all the television with those audiences.

We are seeing additional improvement across our portfolio, the recently completed Spike series Ink Master posted the highest C3 ratings in its history up 14% from the prior season and I love Kellie Pickler got off to a terrific start in CMT last week posting triple-digit ratings gains for the channel in its time slot.", "As we have discussed in the past, we are hyper focused on building upon our industry leading footprint outside of the U.S. no other media company can match the breadth of Viacom's international network brand or broad geographic reach. We intend to push our advantage, in that regards, fiscal 2015 was a landmark year with the full integration of Channel 5 into our operations and the launch of 21 channels around the world including seven in the fourth quarter.", "Also on the quarter, Viacom International Media Networks launched Viacom Play Plex a global suite of brand as mobile apps designed to complement our linear TV channels and allow our distribution partners to deepen and improve the entertainment experience they offer their subscribers. Consistent with the TV Everywhere products we offer in the U.S. these apps will be available on all 180 markets we operate in. We believe no other international entertainment companies offering this type of innovation at this scale serving every major demographic in every major TV market.", "In the last month, Viacom International Media Networks held the EMAs our largest international music tempo of the year. TV viewership remains strong for the show around the globe and digital video views exploded by 340% over the last year. We also had an impressive 300 million social mentions and hash tag MTV EMA was the number one worldwide trending Twitter topic on the night of the show.", "At the studio, Paramount delivered one of the top five movies of the summer in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. Once again, Tom Cruise performed at a superstar level at the Box office in the U.S. and particularly overseas where we drew more than 70% of the sales revenue. Paramount\u2019s ability to produce and market films is stronger than ever, but we simply did not have enough films in the pipeline this year to take full advantage of our capabilities.", "In fiscal 2016, we have committed to returning Paramount to a full 15-film slate.

We're all learning more and more every day, but we are confident the pace of change we have set gives us an important long-term advantage over our competition.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.", "At our media networks segment revenues in the quarter were up 5% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 3% while international revenues increased 11%. Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency international revenues were up 21%, primarily due to the acquisition of Channel 5.", "Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our media networks' revenue performance. In terms of advertising, worldwide advertising revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 7% and international revenues grew 45%. The increase in international advertising revenues was driven by growth in Europe principally from Channel 5.", "Foreign exchange losses had a nine percentage point negative impact on international advertising growth. In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 10%. Domestic revenues were up 15% in the quarter while international revenues declined 14%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreement as well as rate increases.", "Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point unfavorable impact on international affiliate revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenue declined as revenue growth from new channel launches and increases in subscribers were more than offset by the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements.", "Turning to expenses, overall expenses increased 12% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 19% while distribution and other expenses increased 11%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter. Expense growth was driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 as well as higher programming, advertising and promotion expense, primarily related to new original series and specials.", "Media networks\u2019 adjusted operating income was down 6% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margins was 37%. Moving to filmed entertainment, revenues were down 24% in the quarter principally due to decreases in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange had a five percentage point unfavorable impact on filmed entertainment revenue growth.", "Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of filmed entertainment revenue. Theatrical revenues declined 20%, foreign currency had a nine percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. Lower carryover revenues from prior period releases were partially offset by revenues from our current quarter releases, including Mission Impossible: Rouge Nation and Terminator Genisys.", "Home entertainment revenues declined 54% principally due to the absence of releases in the September quarter of this year whereas last year we released Transformers and Noah. Ancillary revenues declined by 38% due primarily to lower consumer product licensing revenues with last year's September quarter benefiting from the release of Transformers. Filmed entertainment generated adjusted operating income of a $122 million in the quarter as compared to 213 million last year. The September quarter of last year benefited from both the theatrical and home entertainment of performance of Transformers.", "Moving to taxes the full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.2%, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thank you, Wade. Let me cover our full year result as well talk about our cash flow and our debt. I\u2019ll also cover seasonal factors impacting the 2016 fiscal year that haven\u2019t already been discussed. For the full-year, Viacom generated $13.3 billion of revenue. $3.9 billion of adjusted operating income, $2.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $5.44 of adjusted earnings per share. That breaks down as follows.", "Media Networks generated revenue of $10.5 billion which is an increase of 3% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion declined 3% as compared to 2014. Affiliate revenue grew 5% for the year, while advertising revenue increased 1%. And the Media Networks adjusted operating income margin was 39.5%. Filmed Entertainment generated revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted operating income of a $111 million and an operating income margin of 4%. For the total company foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 2% on revenue growth, 1% on operating income growth and $0.14 on full-year EPS.", "As I mentioned, we generated 2.2 billion in operating cash flow for the year or $5.50 per share, which is a free cash flow yield of approximately 11%. In terms of capital return to shareholders, for the full-year, we repurchased 21 million Viacom B shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion. In July, we also increased our dividend per share by 21% to $0.40 a share. Between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $2.1 billion to our shareholders in the fiscal year, which is a return on market capitalization of approximately 10%. We ended the year with 50 million Viacom A shares and 348 million Viacom B shares outstanding.", "Now, moving onto our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In September, we repaid a $250 million of outstanding of our 4.25% senior notes which came due. We also redeemed $550 million of our 6.25% senior notes, which are due in April 2016, leaving 368 million remaining outstanding. We ended the quarter with $12.3 billion of total debt and $506 million of cash and cash equivalents. This is an $800 million decrease in gross debt from our June quarter. As previously mentioned, we redeemed the $550 million of senior notes to ensure that we stayed within our leverage ratio target. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was three times.", "Now let's turn to some other factors impacting fiscal 2016. We've discussed ad sales and affiliate revenues. For the full-year we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid to high single-digits. In terms of taxes, for 2016 we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. At Paramount, we're excited about our upcoming slate, which includes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. For fiscal 2016, we expect profit to be weighted to the back half of the year as the studio benefits from their summer releases. For the December quarter, given the softer performance of certain of our theatrical releases we anticipate difficult bottom line comparisons to the prior year.", "Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, Paramount has just wrapped production on Star Trek 3 and they are currently in production on next Jack Reacher film. Current films in preproduction includes Brad Pitt starring in a romantic thriller, second World War 2, Robert Zemeckis and a film by award winning filmmaker Alexander Payne titled Downsizing. In addition, the studio is in active development on Transformers 5 as well as future installments of the franchise. And the studio extended their First Look production deal with Martin Scorsese.", "In summary, we are investing in our brand and we're building new capabilities to take advantage of the opportunity and meet the challenges as our industry continues to evolve. At Media Networks we're growing the level of original program. Six of our top 10 networks are seeing year-over-year ratings growth and we continue to secure long-term affiliate deals with both traditional and digital distribution partners.", "At Paramount, we are developing our franchise pipeline of film and we have made great progress in TV production in a short period of time. On the advertising front we are Don of the new age of data enhanced marketing. We have invested in technology and in our capabilities, which has enabled us to establish a leading position providing advanced ad sales products and solutions for our marketing partners. It is important to remember, television remains the most compelling vehicle for reaching and influencing consumers and data enhanced marketing will only make that more true.", "With that. I would like to turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] we\u2019ll take our first quarter from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thank you so much. One for Philippe, one for Tom. Philippe there has been a lot of discussion this second quarter on these calls regarding SVOD strategy and I was just hoping for sort of a more detailed update from your end. Especially as you are getting bigger into sort of more traditional Hollywood and dramas and comedies, but also strategy around your core channels. Is there anything of a data that you are seeing that suggests the strategy needs to be revised or changed and any thoughts on to the idea of holding back multiple seasons from current shows to pursue TV Everywhere versus selling into SVOD. And then for Tom, I was hoping just the first thoughts on free cash flow generation as you look at fiscal 2016. When I look at the last four to five years. Your conversion ratio has really bounced around a lot, I think there was some discussion in this call about ramping the films slate a little bit which can use some capital, any sort of thoughts around free cash flow progression versus 2015 would be helpful? Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Doug. I'll take your SVOD question. We have always been at the core side of thinking through how we handle distribution of our content, remember we have a vast library of owned content, for many, many years most of our networks have created original programming, while we have stepped up the level of original programming this is nothing new for us.", "So we have successfully over the last several years generated a large amount of revenue from this new revenue stream; and we have strategically developed and chosen windows for different types of programming down to specific shows and moved around distribution of some of these shows around the existing major SVOD in the U.S. and diminishment of our presence on Netflix. And that goes both for our networks here at Viacom and Apex.", "So we think that through we look at not just the monitory value, but the promotional value of having shows at different points in the cycle on SVOD and it is often useful to prior seasons as we launch new seasons as an example. Internationally, SVOD is a driver of growth, when you look at a country like China, which is somewhat limited and the traditional distribution of television product you are seeing a large number a larger number than in the U.S. of significant SVOD players.", "So for the first we see China as a potentially significant growth market not just in the film business for Hollywood, but also for us in the television business and we are seeing rapid expansion of distributional opportunities there and elsewhere as well as increases in pricing as those service grow. So we view in this arena as in everywhere else that technology is our friend and it is good to be on the content side of the business and we maintain a flexibility on distribution.", "I just want to touch on TV Everywhere, we also believe it is extremely important to work with our long-term distributors in expanding the television experience for consumers. It is good for the ecosystem and we are working very closely with them as the invest capital in developing technology for better TV Everywhere experience to provide the underlying content and to assist in better consumer interface; to assist in greater availability of video-on-demand and work with them on better monetization of the on-demand viewing where there is great opportunity for us and distributors in area such as dynamic and ad insertions to better monetization of all the content that consumers want to watch in the home and outside of the home.", "Thomas Dooley", "Doug on the cash flow question. As you can see from the cash flow schedule that we provided in the web deck, the media networks segment continues to generate in the area of $3.5 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow a year, we expect that to continue, we've made some capital investments in terms of incremental working capital, in terms of Paramount that's to fund the incremental production and expanded production I believe and I discussed in our remarks.", "And in the future I think we can look forward to that tapering down as we get to the production level that we need to get to for those film. One of the big variables for us that you see in backup is cash taxes. Cash taxes benefited in 2015 from a very nice benefit associated with our acquisition of Channel 5 that has helped us in certain tax policies. Next year, we won't have the benefit of that Channel 5, so there could be an increase of $300 million plus associated on the tax line. But we're also looking at certain tax legislation that may offset some of that into the future. It\u2019s kind of hard to predict that tax line until that tax legislation gets nailed down, but you know we see the company being able to generate very strong free cash flow well into the future.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson with Moffett Nathanson.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thank you, I have to Philippe and Tom, either one of you guys can you just grab it. The first one and you mentioned this on your opening remarks. In 2016 Nielsen's going to make two big changes here in their measurement services. One is they are going to move to an NTX Audience Universe and second they are going to add total audience measurements. So I wonder, what do you think is going to happen to your GRP deliveries as they expand their measurements and [indiscernible] the lift you get from all that.", "Thomas Dooley", "Universe estimates will take us down a little bit and the other adjustment they are making will take us up a little bit. It's hard to forecast exactly how that's going to play out in the aggregate, but we think net-net we may benefit and this would begin in January and forward and it's only us that would benefit the entire cable ecosystem, so. We do look forward to that and think Nielsen is doing some good work there to try and make things more accurate and get a broader sample to help everybody get better definition on some of the smaller networks.", "Philippe Dauman", "I just want to reinforce what Tom just said, and that we are working very closely with Nielsen so that Nielsen measurement system continues to improve. So we are optimistic on that happening, the precise timing of when different levels of improvement occurs is obviously not within our control. And so that is a parallel joint effort to the efforts that we are making and better measurement through data analytics as I described in my remarks.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay, and then secondly on Paramount, if you look at the results this year and the trend of past couple of years, it's been disappointing to our estimates. And I wonder, given the needs perhaps more scale or to make as you said, more production starts. Why not seek to consolidate Paramount with another studio, is scale an issue here and if not what is the diagnosis for the ills over the past couple of years.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well look the movie business is a cyclical business. We certainly have seen that in a big way with what Universal has done this year where they have moved from what was a couple of years ago lower operating income performance than what Paramount had last year to well over billion dollars in operating income. That's just the nature of the business. Now for a variety of reasons having to do with issues in development to cash availability and so forth, we just had too few movies to support the infrastructure that we have and really to generate revenue.", "So we think Paramount will turnaround that's why we're investing in it. We are operating Paramount efficiently, we have growth initiatives in television and animation that will pay off as you know Michael it does take a little time. Had we for example started the television production business a few years ago, there would be significant deficits in this kind of business. We're able in today's environment to start up very successfully this television production business with almost no net cost to us in either overhead or development with a variety of shows that we have.", "So we're very optimistic about where Paramount can go. We do have a large number of franchises as we do have long-term relationships with some of the top talent around ranging from recent renewal of Martin Scorsese to Michael Bay to J.J. Abrams coming off the coming release of Star Wars. So just a broad variety of talent and we believe Paramount will come back and come back strongly in the years to come.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks Philippe, thanks Tom.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Thank you. Philippe you talked about fully measured consumption earlier, the market is getting more comfortable with Vantage, so can you talk about what contribution you are seeing to growth and to what extent there may be an opportunity to monetize Vantage outside of Viacom and also are you still on target for your non-Nielsen advertising target of 30 going to 50. Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, we are driving to growth of Vantage, obviously there're big opportunities as you have upfront discussions leading up to next year as part of the upfront sales which is why we're targeting this tripling of Vantage clients. And remember let me put the number of Vantage clients in context. If you look at our advertising revenues, our top 100 or so advertising clients accounts for more than three quarters or our advertising revenues, these are the major marketers in the U.S.", "So, when we talk about having 11 today and tripling them and obviously there is a focus of the biggest season among the 100, it really does turn into a significant portion of our advertising base and that's what gets us over this three year period to having all of these measure and metric compliment the Neilson part of our business and we intend to grow that rooster of clients from next year into the following year.", "Because we have this leading capability, it is true that there are lot of other players, new emerging players as well as existing ones who are interested in talking to us about opportunities to work together and driving outside revenue. So you are quite right to identify the possibility of some enhancements as we work with others and engage in these partnerships. You will be seeing more announcements in months to come of partnerships likely the one we recently announced with TiVo and others.", "John Janedis", "Thanks, Philippe. And maybe separately, just another theme this quarter has been reducing ad loads, you talked about that a few months ago, now that we are kind of there, meaning calendar fourth quarter. on the practical level, will there be any visible impact on that growth?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well I think as I mentioned and we expect to see continued sequential improvement and this is despite this reduction of ad loads, we think it's a good strategic decision. We are playing for the full year and we are playing for the longer, we have all these other products that I have mentioned that we just talked about is one example that will enhance our monetization as we go forward.", "Not to mention, a continued growth in compelling programming, we continue to have a large number and a big proportion of the top hits on cable television and that will continue to grow as we just accelerate the development production and airing of all these new shows in different genres on our different networks. So, I believe all of that together will continue to improve our advertising performance and also bring it back to a positive.", "John Janedis", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Matthew Esposito", "Hi, this is Matt on for Rich, just a quick one for Philippe. So selling to Hulu has been perceived as better or been selling Netflix, because at least it protected the ad model. So I guess I just was curious to hear your thoughts on Hulu\u2019s ad free subscription and I guess Viacom\u2019s willingness to sell the other ad free SVOD service is going forward.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you Matt. Well as I said before, we are both strategic and tactical in how we license content to all forms of distribution and we want the entirety of the ecosystem to work well together. We think there is just a lot of opportunity, consumers are using multiple services, in the course of their lives they watch television on a big screen, they will use their tablets or watch on apps, their new mobile products like Go90 out there.", "We think there are lot of opportunities for content owners, both for existing content that we produce for television and new forms of content, what I did not mention except touching on it in the opening remarks is we have an opportunity to create a lot of new short form and even longer form content specifically for new platforms. We've announced developments for platforms like Snapchat of series that are 10 seconds each, we are going to have a leading mobile video production capability both in LA and New York and as well internationally.", "So we are willing to look at all models, of course, it depends on what value we receive in exchange for that. So the model of having both advertising and affiliate revenue is a great model, but ad free model can also be good depending on what monetization you get and we're good monetization when we do SVOD deals and that whole environment we look at it as a totality, it's been a growth market for us. Even though content moves from platform-to-platform it's been overall a steady growth market and I believe you will see new players emerge both here in the U.S. and abroad and that will create even more opportunities for us and our competitors.", "Matthew Esposito", "Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you just two questions. I guess first following up on your commentary on advertising revenues and the outlook. I mean any color you can give us in your ability to monetize both a healthier scatter market that we are seeing right now and obviously better ratings at Nick in the December quarter when take into account the reduction in ad loads that you have mentioned perhaps prior makers and the commitment you have made in the upfront. I guess are you still in a good position to monetize it?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes the scatter market as many of our brethren have pointed out is strong were seeing good pricing, good demand and we will every attempt particularly on networks that and they are more of our networks that are growing their ratings. we will look at opportunities to take advantage of that and off course to your point working our ways through our ADU obligation, and we expect to see continued momentum not just the Nick, but across a number upon that was that Tom mentioned and I had named. So the networks six of our top 10 networks are showing growth and we are working on the other four to turn to growth with very specific measures including I think good changes in leadership that have occurred over the last several weeks and months.", "Alexia Quadrani", "And then jus the follow-up on your commentary on content sales, I think you just said it's a good growth opportunity, good growth market. Is there any way you can sort of frame it for us in terms of even just very generally speaking in terms of kind of what inning are you in, I mean how much you have that some great deals that you have done so far. I guess any sense of how much opportunities still exist due these deals both domestically or internationally?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well. We are in a constant dialogue and as we are ramping up production obviously there is a lot of interest in what we are doing among those distributors as well as others. Also as I touched on earlier it's an opportunity for Paramount to produce original programming, some of those who are generating original programming and a lot of its production also creates opportunity internationally. Internationally we really are seeing significant growth in new distribution platforms that just SVOD but just generally mobile for example that\u2019s creating opportunities for us over the medium and long-term that just didn\u2019t exist before and we are working hard to develop that.", "The other benefit of the increased level original programming, we are creating here in the U.S. is that it is supporting our launch of many media networks internationally. Very often those networks have been distributed in a TV Everywhere fashion with a lot of multiplatform capabilities. There are actually a number of countries in the world, which in many respects are more advanced than the U.S. in that regard.", "So we are particularly optimistic on the opportunities around the world and we have strong hold positions in the UK and in India, which are both great markets and a lot of open deals of opportunities in Latin America, in Africa and other parts of Asia as well as Europe. For example, this month we have launches going on in France, we have we My MTV, which is a first time for this product if you can remember My Nick Jr. so we have My MTV starting for the first time in France and you can expect to see that in other markets and we are also launching BET France this month. So we continue to launch new products and are in discussions with a number of players and a lot of new players coming through our doors talking about the opportunity to take advantage of our brands and our content.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.", "Brian Wieser", "Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just talk about monetization of your apps and digital revenue and associated with those apps and maybe more broadly? How do you look at monetizing a non-video activity at the present time?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well. There are several ways in which we monetized our apps; there in a TV Everywhere environment when we have expansion of the TV Everywhere universe with our affiliates there would be more and more opportunities to monetize that content. We have additional content that is in front of the wall, including as you suggest other types of content whether its games or otherwise that we derive revenue from and that also grow.", "And then finally there is the game apps and apps like Noggin which we monetized through subscription revenue or sale revenue. So that is a growing universe and again that's not just in a U.S. context but in an international context and for example, the Play Plex product that our international group is launching will open up multiplatform revenue in different parts of the world and we are working with affiliates around the world to roll that out. And we've been told by a lot of affiliates that is the most advanced product in the marketplace and they are very pleased with it.", "Thomas Dooley", "Brian on the digital and the digital world as you know the inherent linear television model that we live with today if an advertiser buys female 18 to 34, 18 to 49, any other delivery around that part or that advertisement is now monetized. If you move to the VOD world where cable system operator has video-on-demand and the show is watched. You have the opportunity to really dynamically insert ads to each viewer which results in a much increased yield in terms of the amount of revenue and monetization of each viewer watching the show. So as that evolves and that's a long-term evolution that will take place over the next three to five years. That will provide I think many advertisers and certainly media companies selling advertising with an opportunity to get a much more efficient yield and monetization associated with the consumption and viewership around each television show.", "Brian Wieser", "If I may just on that when it comes to traditional television, what are you currently seeing in terms of the opportunity for programmatic TV sales and maybe monetizing some of the inventory that advertisers aren't chasing because of conventionally data driven, the data driven sales. You are trying to push or the conventional age, gender based demos, do you see\u2026", "Philippe Dauman", "Programmatic has its role Brian, but you know for us, a lot of our advertisers - we use that for remnant inventory that we can\u2019t sell and to be quite blunt about it we don't have a lot of inventory that can\u2019t sell. We sell the vast majority of our inventories. I think programmatic down the road combined with VOD will certainly drive up the yield, net revenue per show as we get paid for more of the viewership on each show.", "Brian Wieser", "Great, thank you very much.", "Wade Davis", "Operator we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.", "Bryan Kraft", "Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask you two questions. Following up on the topic of ad load reductions, can you explain how you are going about implementing those ad load reductions across the networks for example is that happening all at once. And is reducing the clutter giving you some visible improvement in the pricing you are getting. And then separately on your affiliate fee outlook, how dependent is the high single-digit 2016 growth outlook on step-ups from upcoming renewals and can you just comment on what the underlying assumptions are for licensing revenue growth in 2016, are you expecting growth there, you know a more of a flat outlook. So any help there would be great. Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the ad load we've been focusing mostly on networks primetime, we've been looking at it network-by-network and very often on shows, we expect over time as viewing experience improves that that will improve ratings and we do believe there are some pricing opportunities particularly when you marry it with our Viacom Velocity and Vantage product. As far as affiliates, we have a large number of opportunities, we have long-term contracts that are in place multiple years, we have these new outlets whether it's SVOD, mobile or otherwise. So as we have over the last many years we continue to be comfortable with guidance now in the high single-digits, we had double-digits, we always guide at the high single-digit and low double-digit. We continue to guide it in the high single-digit, as a reminder we did 8% domestic affiliate growth last year.", "Bryan Kraft", "Okay.

Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30.", "Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.

These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner M. Redstone", "Good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased to join you today to discuss Viacom's 2011 fourth quarter and year-end results. I'm certain you've seen the numbers by now and know that it was a strong, a very strong positive quarter and another truly outstanding year for Viacom. Most impressive was the balanced performance we saw from our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment division. ", "Our television brands are strong, getting strong and strong and stronger. And Paramount is building a new stable of film franchises with worldwide appeal. Viacom is currently on a roll. We have a smart programming, investment strategy. We have a disciplined operation approach. And most important, we have the best possible management team led of course by Philippe Dauman for our shareholders in the short-term and over the long life. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Philippe who is certainly one of the wisest, most brilliant CEOs in the media industry. Philippe, take over.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner.", "Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today. As we mark the end of our fiscal year, I'm pleased to report that Viacom is stronger than ever. We continue to manage our business with maximum efficiency to expand margins across the board, for both the short and long term. Key to that success is our singular focus on content, and we are building on that foundation. Viacom is consistently investing in new programming to grow our brands and deepen our audience relationships. We are developing our international operations to unlock long-term growth, particularly at Paramount, which is taking advantage of global opportunities on the film side, and at Nickelodeon, which is building a robust global consumer products business. We are aggressively distributing our brands across all platforms to capture incremental monetization. ", "Our Media Networks continue to benefit from the dual revenue streams and affiliate sales which we expect will continue to grow annually at high-single digits to low-double digits for the foreseeable future and advertising. ", "In Filmed Entertainment, we are executing on our franchise and brand-centric development and release strategy. This, coupled with ongoing operational discipline, is resulting in a stable, creatively successful cash flow generator. This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. ", "As we discuss our results this morning, we will speak to the adjusted numbers. ", "Consolidated revenues grew 22% to $4 billion in the fourth quarter, with Filmed Entertainment revenues up 46% and Media Networks up 8%. Our fiscal 2011 revenues were up 12%, driven by a 10% gain in Media Networks revenues as a result of a 10% increase in advertising, a 12% increase in affiliate revenues and a 15% increase from Filmed Entertainment, primarily due to significant gains in theatrical. ", "Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations grew 33% to $614 million in the September quarter and diluted earnings per share were $1.06, up 41% over the prior year. For fiscal 2011, net earnings from continuing operations rose 22% to $2.25 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.78, a 25% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow exceeded $2.6 billion for the fiscal year. ", "No one has a crystal ball, but we manage Viacom to be well positioned in every economic environment. We are constantly looking for opportunities to increase efficiencies and adapt our organization. ", "In the fourth quarter, we made restructuring moves in our Media Networks and at Paramount, particularly in our international activities. These moves, which resulted in a $130 million charge in the quarter, will, in addition to reducing our overhead costs, help us capitalize on emerging business trends and execute faster and more efficiently in response to the continued evolution of global entertainment markets. ", "At the same time in late October, we announced the creation of more than 100 new positions in worldwide accounting, finance and other corporate support functions in the state of Tennessee near our current CMT network headquarters. We were able to create not only significant efficiencies in the move, but also bring jobs onshore. ", "You can expect us to continue to manage our businesses aggressively to capture more opportunities, better monetize across platforms and drive margin expansion. Shareholders can also count on us to maximize free cash flow and return capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ", "In 2011, we increased our quarterly dividends 67% to $0.25 per share and we also bought back $2.5 billion in Viacom shares under the $4 billion repurchase program. Today, we announced that our board has approved a major expansion of our repurchase program by increasing it to $10 billion. We expect to complete this program in approximately 2 years. This demonstrates our focus on growing our returns to shareholders and our strong confidence in our ability to continue to generate significant excess free cash flow, even as we invest steadily in our business. ", "Now let's talk about how our divisions performed in the quarter. Our Media Networks are strong, with leading brands that are as vibrant as ever. We continue to invest in programming, the research that informs it and the marketing that fuels it. ", "For the quarter, our advertising revenues were up 7%, both worldwide and in the U.S. For the full fiscal year, ad revenues were up 10%, driven by 10% growth domestically. ", "Many of our channels achieved double-digit ad revenue increases this quarter, positive momentum that was tempered somewhat by ratings issues at select networks. This softness is related primarily to the performance of extended repeats of acquired programming. As we have noted in the past, audience preferences are shifting as they continue to seek more fresh original programming. Our focus on investing in original programming that we own and control, along with ongoing scheduling refinements and more selectivity in acquiring third-party programming, will help us aggressively address this issue. ", "While still early in the quarter, we expect to see continued operating momentum and strong bottom line results in our Media Networks segment. Ad sales growth will face some headwinds from a slight softening in volume in the current scatter market, although, pricing remained strong and from ratings issues at certain networks, including an anomalous situation I will discuss later. Any impact will be offset by continued strong affiliate revenue growth in the quarter from both traditional and digital sources and from continued cost discipline. ", "Studios continue to be a very strong advertising category for us and growth in the number of film releases should help in the current quarter. We're also making progress in non-endemic categories. In fact, auto and insurance were top 10 categories for us in 2011 and top 5 in year-over-year growth. ", "This mid-September, we have experienced an inexplicable drop in Nickelodeon's ratings which are historically very predictable. We have had extensive discussions with Nielsen to determine the causes of this anomaly and we have been working side-by-side with them to understand and rectify the situation. The Media Rating Council, the industry's independent auditing organization, and our joint invitation is also investigating this aberration in the kids ratings. Investigation includes evaluating independent set-top box data which shows meaningfully different viewership trends. We will continue to work intensely with Nielsen and the MRC until we have a satisfactory resolution even as we move rapidly to mitigate the situation with the introduction of a great deal of fresh animated and live-action content into the Nickelodeon pipeline. ", "Before quarter's end, Nick will premiere 15 new episodes of returning and new series, including the recently launched Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. ", "In distribution, we continue to expand our reach through traditional and emerging platforms. As a result, worldwide affiliate revenues continue to be a reliable and strong growth driver for the company. They're up 11% this quarter and 12% for the year. ", "Our domestic affiliate revenues reflect rate increases from traditional distributors and groundbreaking deals closed with new distributors. Digital distributors continue to present very attractive partnerships for us. They're high margin and they allow us to monetize library content, in effect creating a new syndication window for our franchises. And there's a lot of room for growth in the U.S. and internationally.", "We continue to increase distribution for EPIX which will result in growing long-term profitability for this innovative, multi-platform motion picture pay service. ", "We're also working with our distributor partners to create new access points for our consumers. With Verizon FiOS, we launched authenticated sites for MTV, Comedy, Nick and VH1 with on-demand content. Sites for Spike and BET will be coming soon. With Cablevision, our linear networks are available for in-home streaming via tablets and certain other Internet protocol-enabled devices. We're also working to further enhance the linear viewing experience through initiatives like Interactive TV and 3D. ", "We will continue to experiment with new distribution models across platforms as long as we are able to measure the audience and secure reasonable economic turns. ", "The popularity of our brands has allowed us to pioneer new content and lives across the screens, on air, in theaters, online and on mobile. Our franchises live at the intersection of entertainment and social media and drive today's constant cultural conversation. The record-breaking 2011 VMAs are a great example. The show was MTV's most watched ever. It drove an enormous amount of social media activity and gave us a big ad sales win. Overall, MTV achieved its seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and its highest-rated fourth quarter since 2007. ", "Jersey Shore was the #1 show for our core 12 to 34 demographic. The network's diversified fleet is working, with ratings for scripted programming up 90% over the same period a year ago, thanks also to breakout hits Awkward and Teen Wolf. ", "In the current quarter, the return of Mike Judge's Beavis and Butthead generated strong ratings, averaging a 2.2 rating among 12 to 34s and 2.7 million total viewers, performing very well with males, even with its premiere at bat against game 6 of the World Series. ", "At CMT, we're expanding to a second night of original programming to build on the success of Sweet Home Alabama on Friday nights. Comedy Central achieved double-digit ratings growth in September. The Roast of Charlie Sheen was Comedy Central's most watched telecast ever and drove the network to the highest-rated and most-watched week in its 20-year history. The Daily Show and Colbert Report's late night domination continue, as Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert were the highest-rated late-night cable host in the fourth quarter. ", "In the current quarter, Tosh.0 is up 9% over its previous spring cycle, and our new hit, Workaholics, is building a strong following, up 87% over a year ago. ", "At BET Networks, it was another record-breaking year ratings for both total day and prime time with key gains in the adult demo. In the current quarter, that momentum continued with BET's newest scripted series, Reed Between the Lines, which premiered back-to-back episodes to a combined 6.2 million viewers. The BET HIP-HOP AWARDS 2011 drew in 4.1 million viewers. And on November 29, BET and CENTRIC will simulcast the SOUL TRAIN AWARDS 2011 hosted by Cedric \"The Entertainer\". ", "CENTRIC, now on its second year, posted its best prime time performance yet, delivering double-digit viewer gains in the fourth quarter. The network is also among the top 10 fastest growing cable networks. ", "Fueled by research and refined brand filters, VH1 and Spike are making good progress. In VH1, ratings grew in the fourth quarter from strong performances of Basketball Wives 3 and Single Ladies and the momentum continues. October marks VH1's fifth consecutive month of year-over-year growth, with prime time ratings in the 18 to 49 demo increasing 45% and total viewership growing 34%. ", "Coming up, we have more original premieres, including Mob Wives, Love & Hip Hop 2 and the T.I. Project. ", "Spike is doubling down on original reality programming, building a cost-effective slate that targets a broader audience. The strategy is showing results, with ratings up 10% in prime, thanks to new originals including Auction Hunters and Bar Rescue. TV Land, while experiencing some rating softness, is also expanding its original programming line up with the return of Hot in Cleveland and the premiere of The Exes at the end of this month. ", "Nickelodeon, the number one cable network for 66 quarters and running, has cable's top animated series in SpongeBob and a trio of live-action hits in iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush. At Nick at Nite, ratings have been helped by newly acquired Friends, which in the current quarter has already approved this time period by 10% versus a year ago. ", "Over the next 12 months, Nickelodeon will air 500 original episodes, its most ever as it continues to expand with properties like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Winx and Beatrix Potter. The Nickelodeon brand is usually supportable and ripe for expansion across on air, online and mobile, as well as consumer products, particularly in international markets where we have lots of headroom. That brand extension includes Nickelodeon's newest initiative, Nick Mom, a new 360-degree brand which we announced yesterday. Nick Mom was inspired by research showing that the first generation of parents who grew up watching Nickelodeon have a strong association with the brand, particularly its humor. Nick Mom will launch in the fall of 2012 as a programming block on Nick Jr. ", "Moving to Viacom International Media Networks, we're are making solid progress in our goal of reaching 20%-plus margins in 2013.", "We are now seeing margins in the teens, thanks to consistent operating discipline, solid contributions from all revenue categories and targeted strategic initiatives like our recently announced new joint venture with SBS Media Holdings, Korea's only privately owned free-to-air broadcaster. The alliance will crate a new SBS MTV Channel and make Nickelodeon the first children's channel to be offered by SBS, unlocking significant advertising affiliate and licensing opportunities in this lucrative market.", "Programming investment and brand extensions are also paying off. MTV U.K. saw ratings gains of 20% in the fourth quarter driven by Jersey Shore, the highest rated show in the channel's history, just great news for our biggest ad market in Europe. In Mexico, we're driving higher ad revenue growth as a result of our investments in the successful telenovela format with hits like Grachi on Nickelodeon and Popland on MTV. ", "The European Music Awards, which aired on November 6, were a cross-screen hit, live from Belfast and hosted by Selena Gomez, the show featured performances from Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Coldplay.", "Early ratings indicate growth of 30% over last year's show, with an unprecedented number of online votes, almost 160 million via our global EMA voting campaign. And our international footprint continues to expand. We're launching Paramount channels in several territories over the next year or so, and we have plans to launch 6 new comedy channels, adding to 14 we already have outside the U.S. ", "Now let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment division. Paramount Pictures has had a fantastic quarter and a milestone year. The studio's success has affirmed our strategy of a reduced release slate, a focus on franchises and the leveraging of Viacom brands. Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the studio's first film to gross $1 billion [Audio Gap]. It's now the fourth highest worldwide grossing movie of all time and Paramount's highest grossing international release ever. Transformers' performance was also a strong contributor for fourth quarter gains across home entertainment and ancillary markets. ", "In the current quarter, we scared up another blockbuster franchise release with Paranormal Activity 3, a highly profitable and usually successful title for us. Paranormal is the highest U.S. opening for a horror film, as well as the best October debut ever, with a $53 million domestic opening. The film also did sizable business internationally.", "It generated about $175 million at the worldwide box office so far. We've got a lot more coming on the franchise front. Mission: Impossible The Ghost Protocol starring Tom Cruise, directed by Brad Bird and produced by J.J. Abrams is coming to theaters in December. We're also developing ideas for Paranormal Activity 4 and Transformers 4. J.J., in addition to his Mission Impossible duties, is also focused on developing the next installment of our Star Trek franchise for potential release in 2013. ", "Paramount is adding value throughout Viacom. Together with our Media Networks capabilities, Paramount is responsible for creating a valuable new asset in EPIX. Paramount channels also will help fuel our future robust growth at Viacom International Media Networks. And its new animation division will work hand and glove with Nickelodeon to enhance both businesses and fuel significant growth in our company-wide consumer product efforts. ", "Across our divisions, creativity is alive and well. At Viacom, we apply in intelligence, all intelligence we have in our audiences to create compelling content that resonates with our diverse audiences around the world. We are proactive and disciplined in how we distribute and monetize that content. ", "We see data on a disproportionately high viewing of our content on new platforms, whether it's online or on mobile, and we look forward eagerly to the day when better measurement and monetization of that viewing becomes a reality because we know that this will open up significant incremental revenue opportunities for our company on a worldwide basis. ", "Viacom is fit, lean and always focused on shared strategic priorities. With a one-two punch of [Audio Gap] excellence and operational discipline designed to grow our margins, we have the financial strength and balance to adapt to changing market forces, go the distance and deliver ever greater value to our shareholders.", "With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy.", "James W. Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation, summarizing the results of our September quarter and our fiscal year 2011. Our 10-K will be filed shortly. ", "This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results exclude from this year's September quarter restructuring charges of $130 million on a pretax basis and $90 million after-tax, as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefit, primarily related to prior year audit settlements. ", "Last year's September quarter, adjusted results excluded $27 million in tax benefits that were principally related to the disposition of certain assets. ", "And let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 8% to $2.13 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 7% and international revenues increased 11% in the quarter. ", "Foreign exchange had a six percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. ", "Page 11 in our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 7% in the quarter. International advertising increased 8%, with foreign exchange improving the growth rate by seven percentage points. ", "International ad sales in the quarter were impacted by strength in Latin America, offset by softness in Asia. As we said in our last earnings call, we had fewer integrated marketing events in the September quarter as compared to our June quarter. ", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 9% while international revenues increased 16%. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the international growth rate by 7 percentage points. The growth rate in the quarter was predominantly driven by rate increases. ", "Now moving to ancillary revenues. Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 3% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenues. Media Networks adjusted operating income of $958 million in the quarter increased 10% over last year. The operating margin of 42% improved 80 basis points over the prior year. The movement in the margin was driven by top-line growth of 8%, partially offset by 6% growth in total expenses. ", "Within expenses, programming expense grew 5% while SG&A expense grew 8%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the growth rate for programming expense by approximately 1 percentage point and the growth rate for SG&A expense by approximately 2 percentage points in the quarter. ", "The growth in SG&A expense in the quarter was principally due to higher advertising and promotion expense, related to the marketing of new and returning original series, as well as increased spending on audience research. ", "Now moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues in the quarter increased 46% to $1.8 billion. Page 13 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. ", "Worldwide theatrical revenues increased approximately $400 million to $770 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strong worldwide performance of Transformers 3, which was released on June 29, partially offset by carryover revenues in the prior year's quarter from films including Shrek Forever After. ", "Worldwide home entertainment revenues increased 26% to $511 million in the quarter. The increase reflects a greater number of current quarter releases. During the quarter, we released Transformers 3 domestically, as well as THOR and Ringo, as compared to Iron Man 2 in the prior year's quarter. TV license fees increased 5% to $391 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter was due to higher pay TV and network TV revenues, partially offset by lower foreign syndication revenues. Ancillary revenues increased 49% to $121 million, primarily due to higher digital revenues. ", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $185 million in the quarter as compared to income of $52 million last year. The $133 million increase in operating income principally reflects the strong theatrical and home entertainment performance of Transformers 3, as well as the pay TV availability of some of our theatrical releases. ", "Now moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $11 million in the quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investment in EPIX. On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable. ", "The reported tax rate in the quarter was 28%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $52 million in discrete tax benefit. For fiscal year 2011, the adjusted effective tax rate was 34.3%, reflecting 160 basis point improvement over the prior fiscal year's adjusted rate. The reduction in effective tax rate is primarily driven by an improved international versus domestic mix of income in our operations. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone.", "I'm going to touch on our full year results and some of the restructuring actions we recently took which put us in a very good position for next year. I'll also talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders, as well as seasonal factors impacting 2012.   ", "Now turning to the full year results. 2011 was a great year. At Media Networks, we had a strong top line performance, growing advertising 10% and affiliate revenue 12%. During the course of the year, we added new distribution partners on digital platforms and there continues to be opportunities to add partners,  both domestically and internationally. Media Networks adjusted operating income increased 14% to $3.8 billion, and the margins improved by 150 basis points to 42%. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $200 million of profitability for the year and achieved mid-teens operating margins. ", "On Filmed Entertainment, revenues increased 15%, and the studio generated adjusted operating income of $341 million. This translates to an operating margin of 6% for the studio. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year earnings per share of $3.78, and we produced $2.6 billion in operating free cash flow. ", "Also, we were aggressive in returning capital to our shareholders and we are comfortably below our targeted 2x leverage ratio. For the full year, we repurchased 56 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion. We ended the year with 558 million shares outstanding. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $2.9 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return of approximately 12%. Right now, given everything we see, we believe the high levels of capital return to be sustainable into the future. ", "If you calculate diluted earnings per share using our year-end share count, full year EPS would be 5% higher than what we reported just based on the lower number of shares. ", "Now touching on our restructuring. In the September quarter, we took actions to address our cost structure by improving our efficiency and reducing our headcount in a number of areas across the company. These actions resulted in a $130 million restructuring charge in the quarter. The steps we took put us in a good position for next year even if we experienced a slowing economy. The restructuring will result in approximately $140 million of annual cost savings, approximately $100 million of which will be realized in fiscal 2012. ", "Now moving on to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost of 5.8%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper market place at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had approximately $400 million of commercial paper outstanding at quarter end.", "As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.4 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, our $2 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.8x. Based on our target leverage range, we have excess borrowing capacity. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters to be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x. If you look at our maturity profile, we have only $850 million of fixed rate debt coming due through 2015. ", "Given our free cash flow profile and the lack of substantial subsequent maturities, we are in a secure position to weather any market turmoil and continue to return capital to our shareholders. ", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the 2012 fiscal year. Philippe talked about the ad sales marketplace. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we've continued to see revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit range based on fiscal 2011 affiliate revenue base which includes incremental digital agreements. Given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be at a rate in the mid-teens. We anticipate that Media Networks' 2012 programming expense will grow in the mid to high single-digit range. Our restructuring actions and ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margins as we invest in our brands and programs.", "At Filmed Entertainment, last December's quarter benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to the Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. The December quarter of this year will be impacted by the timing of P&A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission Impossible and The Adventures of Tintin at the end of the quarter. ", "Accordingly, the studio's December quarter will face difficult bottom line comparisons on a year-to-year basis. However, we do see healthy growth in profits at the studio in the March quarter. ", "For 2012, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 35.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. ", "In terms of cash taxes, given the sunsetting in December of accelerated deductions related to film and television production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book taxes for the year. ", "In terms of our stock buyback program, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2012. ", "Looking ahead at the studio's development pipeline, Paramount continues to grow its portfolio of film franchises. In December, the studio will release Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol on a worldwide basis, as well as release domestically The Adventures of Tintin, which is a Nickelodeon-branded collaboration. In April, the studio will re-release James Cameron's TITANIC in 3D in conjunction with Fox. Paramount is also planning the sequel to G.I. Joe, and J.J. Abrams is currently focused on developing the next installment of Star Trek. In addition, the studio continues to work on the creation of a new franchises, such as World War Z starring Brad Pitt. ", "As for our Media Networks brands, Paramount is developing a Nickelodeon-branded live-action movie based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. Also, starting in 2014, Paramount released 1 CGI animated franchise per year through our recently launched animation division headed by David Stainton. ", "To wrap up, in fiscal 2011, we generated strong top and bottom line results. We grew our operating margins and aggressively returned capital to our shareholders. While we have recently experienced rating softness, we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. We continue to operate with a focus on investing in organic opportunities in our core businesses in order to drive earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe that this operating focus, combined with an aggressive capital return program of our share buybacks and dividends, will drive value for our shareholders over the long term. So thanks for listening now, and we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have a couple for Philippe. Philippe, as long as you've done these calls, you've always provided a forward advertising number. Why didn't you do that this time, if you give us a range of what we could expect? That would be one question.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, I've cited in my remarks some of the factors. There is some softness that we're seeing in the volume in the scatter market. We've had the ratings issues, principally that anomalous situation at Nickelodeon, during important selling season for Nickelodeon. So and it's also an early day in the quarter. You know that this is a big quarter as we get into latter part of November and into December. So I think the issues that we had probably will leave us short of the double-digit growth that we had aspired to. But it's really too early to tell where we'll fall exactly in the growth during that time.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, and then if you could talk a bit about -- you mentioned disappointments in some of the extended repeats and acquired programming. So as you move away from acquired program into more originals, can you talk about what the margin impact would be, maybe on a network-by-network basis -- without giving the network details, but is this a profitable switch relative to margins or will margins go down as you invest more in originals and move away from extended repeats?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "No. As You know, Michael, we have, even in the recession, we were able to maintain our margins. And outside of that period, we've been growing our margins in our Media Networks segment. So this has been a gradual process. We are not walking away from third-party acquisitions. We have to be more selective in buying those that will play out better. It's not that they don't work initially. It's that they don't run as long. They've always fallen off after a period of time and that period of time is getting shorter. So as we go forward, for those of our networks, because some of our networks are 90% original programming or more. But as we look at networks that are more dependent, or have historically been more dependent on third-party program, take a TV Land, we have been moving gradually as we get off the third-party acquisition to produce shows like Hot in Cleveland, The Exes. And as we build that library -- those, by the way, play well in repeats for us, and we own them, we can sell them to digital outlets and traditional outlets around the world. So in this new world of distribution where there is more revenue opportunity, this will play out well for us both in current ratings and ad sales and will play out well for us in future revenues. So it's a good short-term and long-term strategy, but we are basically doing it in a gradual way. But as we've been ending these past deals, we have more firepower to direct toward original programming.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. On Nickelodeon, you mentioned third parties set-top box data showing something different in the drop that Nielsen is showing. Can you just give us a sense of whether that third-party set-top box data showing Nickelodeon ratings flat or up or just not declined as much as Nielsen? I'm just sort of curious relative to the 15%, 20% decline that Nielsen is showing...", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, because we're working very closely with Nielsen and MRC. I don't want to go to too much details, but let's just say that we wouldn't have had any conversation with either of them based on the set-top box data that they're examining. That's the reason everybody believes there's an anomaly. We're making good progress, and certainly, we've seen some improvement over the last several days, and I expect that to continue particularly because our Nickelodeon people are not sitting still, and we happen to have in the hopper, before this arose, a lot of new programming. So the combination of those 2 should help quite a bit.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So it's nothing like when young males disappeared 4, 5 years ago and they were gone for 4 months...", "Philippe P. Dauman", "No. This is really an anomaly . Unfortunately, it was a particularly bad time that this occurred. It was a pretty sudden occurrence in mid-September. The timing was unfortunate. I believe it's a short-term phenomenon. One that people besides ourselves recognize to be highly unusual and we're just working it through as expeditiously as possible.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then on the margin comment, maybe I'm sort of  digging a little bit too much, but given international margins are in sort of a strong growth period. I don't know if, Tom, if you want to respond to this. As we think about fiscal '12, should we think about both domestic and international margins for Media Networks as growing or is international really driving the overall growth?", "James W. Barge", "Both areas will grow. We're pretty confident in that.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And international sort of on a steady track, the 200, 300 basis points improvement per year.", "James W. Barge", "International has done a great job under the leadership of Bob Backish to really drive improved profitability and better strategies across the global marketplace.", "Sumner M. Redstone", "I mean, the international story is a very good story, both in terms of velocity of growth as we go forward and just the long-term value creation. We are reaching greater scale in many markets and really rationalizing our operations around the world and we have many opportunities to launch new channels and exploit new distribution opportunities. For international, the opening up of markets through digital distribution is a very significant opportunity given the difficulties that exist in certain markets for traditional distribution.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Brandon Ross - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "It's actually Brandon Ross for Rich. Couple of questions. First, is the weakness in repeats being driven by the availability of content? And do platforms like, Netflix, meaning, is the cash from digital not all incremental here?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, in terms of  our programming that we own, that we are selling at digital outlets, it is incremental because we've been very carefully managing the windows on our content. Now whether the fact that there's a lot of content, new content available across the board, just in traditional, if you look at what all the networks are doing now, there's more original programming on a number of channels, whether you have dramas on AMC or original investments in many other networks out there. So there's a lot of choice and people expect more fresh, original programming. And obviously, taste in genres evolve. When people feel so uncertain, they've gravitate to comedies and that's why you've seen a resurgence in comedies. So there's clearly something going on because of the availability of programming, not just on digital, but on traditional distribution modes, where repeats are just not playing as well. Not necessarily the second, third, fourth repeat but the 15th or 20th repeat of a show that we used to be able to do.", "Brandon Ross - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "And just a second question, now that EPIX is available on Roku, would you guys think about launching a direct-to-consumer business, given that all the distributors are not distributing EPIX?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Right now we're focused on expanding our distribution traditionally -- we, as we have been expanding distribution and whether the benefit that we do offer is distribution on any device for authenticated customers, we -- on broadband, obviously, we have the Netflix 20 million plus subscribers. The exclusivity window on that deal will open up next year and that will open up additional opportunities. So with the increased ways in which consumers can look at the EPIX content will drive incremental revenues. The cost structure is pretty well set. The only variability there is how the movies perform that it's committed to buy.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I was wondering if there's any way to quantify the impact in advertising from the anomalous Nickelodeon ratings issue? I mean, is there anything that you can really quantify? That's one question. And then on a share repurchase, you'll need to get $10 billion, 2 years. You're doing $2.5 billion in year one. Are you trying to signal that this is going to be very back-end loaded or is it just kind of a measure of conservatism in your guidance for this year?", "James W. Barge", "We said that these $2.5 billion in 2012, so that leaves some flexibility there. If you want to answer the other one...", "Philippe P. Dauman", "In terms of -- Nickelodeon, again, because of time period it does impact it, and we said we have aspirations of having double-digit advertising growth in this quarter. That really took that off the table, but obviously we're trying to manage as well as we can including the rest of the quarter on Nickelodeon with all the fresh programming to mitigate the impact. In any event, the total impact, given all the other things going on in the company, as Tom mentioned, we are going to have a very healthy teens growth in affiliate revenues in the quarter. We have the benefit of solid cost efficiencies. So when you put it all together, we have strong operating momentum going forward. It's a little blip in the quarter, but it's not, in my view, a fundamental event in terms of our operating momentum, given everything else that's going on around the company.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "First off, for Tom, you mentioned affiliate growth in the high teens in the first quarter. Just wondering if you could give us a little more granularity on the drivers there, how much of that is incremental growth driven by your digital deals? And even on the traditional side, if you could split out rate and units, basic assumption might be flat unit to subscribers and then rate increases in the mid-to-high single digit. I'm just wondering if you could confirm those types of assumptions? And then I have a follow-up.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I'll take that Anthony. As far as our growth in the quarter, a lot of it, as Tom indicated in his remarks, are driven by recognition of digital revenues under the deals that we have, as well as some incremental additional deals. We are in constant discussions. We don't go in just -- we don't go in on the traditional deals. We don't go in as some do on what the specific deals we're doing or what's involved there. On the traditional side, we have healthy rate growth. It's largely rate increases. We're getting more subs on some of our networks that aren't fully distributed. Again, I'm very pursuant to fill that deals that we have. And as digital viewing on traditional distributors increases, that gives more sub-growth for some of our digital tier-driven networks. So it's a combination of things but largely rate increase on traditional side and digital revenues.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "About 80% of the growth is coming from rate increases, about 20% is unit increases and the unit increases, as Philippe just indicated, as cable operators put more digital boxes out there, that expands our channel capacity in the digital world. So that's where we pick up the additional unit even though the aggregate amount of unit of subscribers might be declining.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then a follow-up for Philippe on this measurement issue with Nielsen. It does seem as though we've been hopeful and talking about better measurement on tablets, on smartphones, on mobile devices for a while. I'm just wondering what is the current plan in place, and what is the timing in place for Nielsen to start measuring this viewership? I mean, clearly it's important for kids -- all of us have a -- kids, they're watching this content on iPads and I just wonder, what is the plan for Nielsen? What is their plan to start integrating? We went through the cycle of C plus 3 [ph] and we got -- I think the industry got where it wanted to go on DVR playback. I mean, what's the plan on mobile measurement?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Nielsen will be better able to answer what their plan is. Obviously, everyone in the industry has been pushing for this to happen because if you are a content and brand owner such as we are, we would like to get our content out there as much as possible and have it measured because that is the currency. So that's certainly been an impediment of, so-called, full TV Everywhere. There's some other ", "issues such as security and the like. But this is a very significant issue and this is why we have to have the right economic arrangements in TV Everywhere kind of situations now in an environment where we can't get advertising monetization on those because of lack of measurement. So Nielsen is telling all of us that they're working on the issue. But I still am not in the position to give a date when it's really not going to happen.", "James W. Barge", "And Anthony, there's some folks in the industry that believe over the next 12 months, they will incrementally add features and build up over that period of time to get a better measurement of that consumption and then in 24 to 36 months, there'll be the whole notion of inserting commercial dynamically as a possibility, which could be a very positive development for everybody in the advertising business.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, I mean, that's a lot of months.", "James W. Barge", "It's going to take time.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We're actually going to see it happen because we believe we'll do very well in that environment.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just have a question on the buyback, just to make sure I'm doing the math that. Free cash, assume no working capital swings, free cash flow after the dividend payment's about $2 billion a year. And I think you said you're doing about, you target about $7.2 billion of this buyback over the next 2 years. Are you essentially saying your going to be taking on debt of about $1.5 billion a year over the next 2 years, or do you think free cash flow is going to grow because of some swing in working capital?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Jason, we have operating momentum. Our leverage ratio, as Tom indicated, closed out the year at 1.8 below our 2x target. We are going to have to increase our leverage just to stay up to that 2.0 target given our operating momentum. So the buybacks will be funded, both by our free cash flow and our borrowing back up to that 2x leverage point as our operating growth takes down our leverage ratio without that additional debt.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So you don't...", "Philippe P. Dauman", "If you look at 2011, that's what happened in 2011.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. You don't anticipate going above 2x temporarily even?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "No, we set that as a target and we're going to hold ourselves to that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just to follow up on your comments on the fiscal Q1 advertising market. Could you give us a sense of roughly what percent of inventory you do have available for scatter or put another way, how much in the December quarter you sold in the upfront? And in the most recent cancellation period, were the options exercised in the normal level?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Cancellations were at the normal level, nothing unusual there. Tom, you want to...", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And right now, we have a very little scatter left and the marketplace has been pretty dynamic, so the scatter has pretty much sold out. There's some left at, sort of, the last couple of weeks to be able to fill out the movie studios, so we have about 20% less, I'd say, of our total scatter inventory.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then you just talked about the -- all the original programming hours on Nickelodeon coming out. Any sense on, I guess, timing on when we should see that rollout?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we have 50 episodes for the rest of this year and about 450 episodes for the following 3 quarters.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Janedis with UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Two quick questions. First, assuming there is some sort of error in the Nickelodeon measurement, is there any way to recapture some of the lost revenue? And then secondly, Philippe, I think you talk about scatter pricing up in the mid-teens above the upfront a few weeks back. Is that still the case?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, in terms of recapturing lost revenue, unfortunately because of that sales period, this is where toys companies and everybody else is looking to advertise for the holidays. So to the extent that there were shortfalls in the range in Nickelodeon, this is why it's taking our number down for the quarter. We had to make it up to them, so that's something you can't recapture. And I always believe in looking forward, so we'll go through that blip, it's not material to overall company and we will move on. What was the other question?", "James W. Barge", "Scatter teams.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Scatter pricing continues to be strong.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "With similar levels you spoke about at the recent conference?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Now we obviously have the new upfront -- the pricing in scatter market is above the new upfront prices.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to James Dix with Wedbush.", "James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "I'm just wondering if you'd give a little color on advertising categories? Are you seeing any categories with kind of continued strength in demand, as opposed to somewhere you think there might have been some pull forward into the upfront out of the scatter market of their buying? And then I guess a longer-term question, you mentioned your increased investment in research on programming. And I'm just wondering if you think over time that's going to help you get more consistency in your ratings or monetization over time?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we are seeing strength in the movie category given the number of titles, given the types of titles that are coming out, whether it's the family titles or the youth-oriented titles. It's a good quarter for the movie category. Toys, strong category in this quarter. This is why it's so vexing to have this issue I've mentioned. And we've been seeing good growth these non-endemics, which in term of the long run is a good trend for, us because those -- we clearly have a low market share that's why the fact that autos and insurance were within our top 5 growing categories year-on-year. It's an important phenomenon for us in the long run and when we are working to continue to build as we maintain our strong share in categories like movies, like toys, like QSRs, like telecom. As far as investment in research and programming, yes. We take a look in our brand direction. We've looked back historically and how we finalized the BET and MTV brands. And we're applying those same tools to all of our networks so that we can -- we're never going to have complete consistency. It is show business, you are subject to consumer taste. But staying close to our consumers creating programming that we own, that we develop, should overall improve our performance over the long term.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Our research and in terms of what we know about kids, teens, young adults, our millennial research has been a key asset as we share that with some of our key advertising partners. And that really does pay off in spades because they're very interested in the behavior of those targeted demographics and how they're going to impact their businesses into the future. And so that's a key linkage that we have and I think a significant advantage we have.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Vasily Karasyov with Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering how big of an opportunity is consumer licensing revenue for you internationally? You are one of the biggest players in the world and that's a very high margin revenue stream. Can you tell us how much you expect it to contribute over the next couple of years, and if you see any opening opportunities there?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, it's a big opportunity. It's one that obviously has to build up. We'll see it grow over the next couple of years timeframe, but it really should grow significantly beyond that time period. And what we've done is we've beefed up our international licensing operation. We've secured talents from other organizations. And most importantly, we have acquired new international property so that we can compete well on the girls aisle and the boys aisle across different toy and soft goods categories. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will be fueled by -- which was a great consumer products franchise in the past. We think we can make it bigger than it was in the past, fueled by the Nickelodeon show, by the Paramount movie, by enhanced distribution. And the expansion of Nickelodeon, not just the Nickelodeon channel, but Nick Jr. and other channels on an international basis will give us additional marketing platform to drive that. So it's a major focus at Nickelodeon, but also at Paramount. We are very excited about that opportunity and should significantly contribute to our bottom line and asset value over the long term.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me for today\u2019s discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Administrative Officer and CFO; and Jimmy Barge, our Controller and Head of Tax and Treasury.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides containing supplemental information available on our website. Before we begin, let me refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Good morning, everyone, and I thank you for joining us. Viacom turned in a solid second quarter performance, particularly in the light of the difficult economic conditions that we, like every company, are facing. Importantly, these results also illustrate the unique strategic advantages that we possess with the continued success of our powerful branded Media Networks and the reinvigorated creative power of our fantastic film studio.", "And while those assets certainly give us [ph] a big competitive leg-up in this very tough market, we are not resting on our laurels or taking anything for granted. We are furthering audience engagement on every screen by continuing to produce great programming. We are working even harder to reduce cost and generate higher returns on our investment dollars. We are innovating and finding new approaches, new business models to keep us ahead of a rapidly changing global entertainment marketplace.", "Our management team has been, will continue to be extremely active, looking for every opportunity to fuel our creative engines to find necessary efficiencies and to push our businesses into new and promising areas. As we look to the future, you can certainly count on Philippe and the entire Viacom team to stay focused on this disciplined and successful approach and make sure we are in a great position to benefit when this economy recovers.", "Now, let me briefly update you on the National Amusements auction process. I can tell you that whatever you may hear from the uninformed, there is substantial interest from a number of our bidders. We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making, and I must tell you we are extremely pleased with our relationship with our banks. Beyond that, I will reserve further comment until we have something definitive to announce.", "And now, let me turn this call over to Philippe.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased you could join us today. Our second quarter results reflect challenges that many companies are facing, both within and outside our industry. The ongoing impact of a weak global economy continues to pressure the advertising and retail markets. We also experienced some difficult year-over-year comparisons as we lapped the more favorable timing of key tent-pole films in 2008 and last year\u2019s rollout of Rock Band on a new platform and in international market.", "Our response to these unfavorable times has been resolute. We are not hunkering down waiting for the economy to improve or for an easier set of comps. We have taken and will continue to take the size of action not only to mitigate the challenges we face, but to be sure that when the tide turns and there are clear indications that it will, we are in the first wave of companies that benefit.", "Among other things, we have substantially reduced our expenses, and there is more of that to come. We have made changes in key leadership positions in our divisions to bring in new thinking, needed expertise, and fresh energy. We are investing prudently in content production. It is the lifeblood of this organization, and we absolutely must continue to nurture the creative process. And we are continuing to strengthen our balance sheet because financial strength is a crucial asset in these times.", "We cannot be sure exactly when the economy will recover. We have seen some signs that certain areas have stabilized, but we are fully prepared to do what it takes to operate successfully for as long as difficult conditions persist. That\u2019s why you will continue to see changes unfold in Viacom as we focus on our key priorities, which I will detail in a few moments. Success with these strategic priorities will result in a stronger operational foundation, which will better position Viacom to pursue new growth opportunities in the future.", "I\u2019ll begin with a quick review of our results. Unless otherwise noted, Tom and I will refer to our adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude the impact of certain severance charges in the quarter. In the second quarter, our consolidated revenues declined 14% to $3.3 billion. Media Networks revenues were down 8% in the quarter. Domestic advertising revenues were down 6% for the quarter, but we did see sequential improvement in the ad market as we moved through the second quarter. Our second quarter results represent a 3 percentage point improvement over the first quarter.", "I\u2019m very happy to report that, as we sit here today, we are just about done with our advertising upfront. Given current conditions, we are very pleased with the results from both a volume and pricing standpoint. I want to thank our advertisers and the advertising agencies for their continuing support of our iconic brands.", "Getting back to the second quarter, worldwide affiliate fees grew 9%, reflecting both rate and subscriber increases. Ancillary revenues declined 41% for the quarter primarily due to lower sales of Rock Band, a result of the soft retail economy around the world. Despite the outstanding performance of both Star Trek and Transformers", "Revenge of the Fallen, our Filmed Entertainment segment saw revenues fall 22% on a worldwide basis. This decline reflects a challenging comparison due to the timing of our tent-pole films this year versus last, as well as continuing industry weakness in the home entertainment market.", "Longer-term, we continue to innovate in the motion picture market. Epix is announcing today that it has signed up its first distribution partner, Verizon. FiOS is one of the fastest growing distribution platforms in the US and has a significant presence in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington DC, and Dallas, among other cities. FiOS customers got access anytime anywhere to the partner\u2019s first run movies and to a broad selection from their vast libraries of films, original programs and special events when Epix launches in early October.", "Epix is a multi-platform game-changer in the premium window, and you can look forward to announcements of more distribution deals in the near future. Our efforts to reduce costs across the company are yielding positive results. We remain on target to achieve $200 million in savings in connections with the initiatives we announced late last year. We are also continuing to identify additional savings as we make adjustments in our organizational structure and business processes.", "Viacom\u2019s net earnings were $298 million for the quarter, down 27% from the second quarter of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.49, a 23% decline over diluted EPS of $0.64 in the second quarter of 2008. As I noted earlier, our balance sheet remains strong, fueled by substantial free cash flow. This financial strength positions us extremely well to operate effectively in this economic environment and to meet our future funding needs.", "Now let\u2019s turn to our Media Networks. In the second quarter, we continued to build our brands and invest in new content to engage our audiences across platforms. We know how to connect with audiences in meaningful ways wherever and whenever they want the consumer content.", "In the online universe, our presence is constantly expanding. In the second quarter, we streamed [ph] more than 1 billion videos online in the US. We are not just pushing our content out there, we are creating better ways to monetize the content. We are innovating in the creation of more effective advertising formats from marketers while not diminishing the experience for viewers.", "Recently, we released the result of a comprehensive study on online advertising for short-form video, an area that has experienced tremendous growth. In the first six months of the year, the average viewer spent 37% more time viewing videos online than in the same time period last year. Monetization in this arena, however, has been somewhat elusive. Our study called Project Inform, review of insights that are crucial to creating the innovative solutions required to maximize this revenue opportunity. When it comes to providing more long-form video online, we are evaluating a number of ideas and closely watching other experiments that are occurring in the industry.", "We want to make our content even more accessible to consumers because we understand that our brands are more than just entertainment to them. They become a meaningful part of their lives, and most often, that relationship begins on television. Audiences continue to increase the amount of time they spend consuming content across all platforms, including television.", "The average American watched about 153 hours of television per month at home during the first quarter, up 1.2% over the same quarter last year. And our distribution partners recognize the value of the content we provide, which continues to account for 21% of the ad-supported cable viewing and helped us to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in domestic affiliate revenues. Our networks are leading brands with their respective demographics. Those positions are strengthened further by our consistent investment in programming.", "In addition to creating more highly successful original programming such as Nickelodeon\u2019s Penguins of Madagascar or Spike\u2019s Jesse James Is a Dead Man, we are also making a select number of strategic acquisitions. For example, we acquired 30 Rock for COMEDY CENTRAL, Everybody Hates Chris for Nick at Nite, and Entourage for Spike.", "As you know, we have been particularly focused on improving the ratings of certain networks and were making solid progress. Over the past several quarters, we have made substantial changes at BET. The new programming management team that we put in place last fall has aggressively pursued a new slate featuring more original content and specials, as well as strategic acquisitions. They have built a completely new programming schedule that is resonating with viewers in all day parts.", "As a result, BET just concluded its highest rated quarter in the network\u2019s 29-year history. Ratings were up 35% over the prior year and those gains have continued in the first several weeks of July. BET capped off the second quarter with the BET Awards \u201909, which paid tribute to Michael Jackson, delivered a triple-digit improvement in ratings over the 2008 show and currently stands as the number one cable network telecast of the year, drawing more than 10.5 million total viewers.", "BET has strong momentum that will be further fueled as it continues to implement its rebranding strategy, launching more new programming across all time periods, including a new entrant into late night TV with The Mo'Nique Show.", "VH1 delivered an outstanding quarter with strong performance by several original series as well as special presentations. April was the highest rated April in the network\u2019s history and the quarter was the best second quarter ratings performance ever. VH1 audience delivery was up 18% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter, including double-digit growth in primetime. The ratings and TV were still a challenge during the second quarter.", "During the past few months, however, we have taken a number of actions that are already beginning to have a positive impact. We have introduced a new slate of programming based on MTV\u2019s new brand filter. This new filter better reflects the entertainment desires of the millennial generation and it allows us to expand into a broader range of programming genres, including fashion, live formats, comedy, animation and even sports.", "As we have shifted our programming focus, we also made a number of changes in our programming and development team to bring in fresh ideas and new expertise. These changes are working. We began to see real improvement with the very successful MTV Movie Awards, which aired on May 31st and delivered its best ratings in five years, up 95% over the last year\u2019s show. Since then, the trend line of MTV\u2019s ratings has shown steady progress.", "The network is delivering larger audiences across more day parts as the schedule is rebuilt. Over the past seven weeks, MTV\u2019s audience delivery numbers have improved to just a 5% year-over-year decline compared with the 14% overall decline in the second quarter. And we expect that trend to improve further.", "The bottom line is this. MTV remains an iconic and powerful brand for young people. Our challenge is to reengage them and hold their attention for longer period. We will take whatever steps are necessary to turn MTV\u2019s ratings trend positive. This is the top priority of the MTV Network\u2019s management team, and it is a key priority for Viacom.", "I would also like to highlight the fact that Colors, our general entertainment Hindi language channel in India now beginning its second year, was the number one rated general entertainment channel in the country for the month of May and June. In addition, our Nickelodeon channels, which we continue to roll out in new territories, are experiencing strong ratings growth across almost all geographies.", "Our ancillary revenues continue to feel the impact of the soft retail environment as it weighs on sales of our consumer products. We are seeing this impact around the world. One notable exception to this trend is our billion dollar franchise, SpongeBob SquarePants. Sales of this lovable character and many of the toys, games, books and apparel bearing the Sponge are up year-over-year. SpongeBob is definitely benefiting from all the activities supporting his tenth anniversary, which is being celebrated around the globe.", "With regard to Rock Band, the tough economic climate has tamped down its sales as well. But we continue to feel very good about the long-term value this franchise holds, particularly as we see the downloadable content portion of the business continue to grow. To date, we\u2019ve sold nearly 50 million songs via disc or online.", "In addition, we have brought in new leadership for our MTV Games group, which among other things will focus on two key priorities. First, they will work to increase efficiencies in our games division to drive greater profitability. Second, they will work closely with our partners to prepare and execute the right marketing and distribution strategy for the worldwide launch of The Beatles", "Rock Band on September 9. This is truly an unprecedented event. This game, and it\u2019s really more than just a game, it is truly an extraordinary musical experience and a work of art. This game will change the way people view music video games.", "Now let\u2019s move to the Filmed Entertainment segment. From a box office standpoint, Paramount Pictures had a standout second quarter. That is number two in domestic market share and producer distributed three of the year\u2019s top ten movies. Star Trek currently stands as the number three movie of the year domestically and has garnered nearly $380 million in global receipts. Importantly, we\u2019ve revived this valuable franchise and introduced it to a new generation of fans.", "Transformers", "Revenge of the Fallen is the number one movie of 2009 with at this point more than $785 million in global box office. This incredible sequel already ranks among the top ten movies of all time domestically. Clearly, Paramount has recharged its creative engines and we are very pleased with our development pipeline. With this creative success will come bottom line success.", "The studio\u2019s profit margins must and will improve. We have already taken a number of steps. We have removed certain costs from the system and have more to do here particularly in the areas of production and home entertainment infrastructure. We\u2019ve also made significant changes in management at the studio.", "One area of focus is our home entertainment business, which like the rest of industry continues to be soft. While the economy is certainly playing a role in this decline, the trend does support the notion that the consumers\u2019 appetite for DVDs may be showing signs of fatigue. There is, however, a notable exception to that premise.", "The DVD conversion rates were strong box office performers to date released on DVD are holding up relatively well compared with last year. This should bode well for DVD business in the fourth quarter when we release Star Trek, Transformers", "Revenge of the Fallen, and DreamWorks Animation's Monsters vs. Aliens.", "Looking ahead, we are getting ready for the premiere next week of a new franchise GI Joe", "The Rise of Cobra.", "In conclusion, our businesses continued to deliver solid performances in very challenging conditions. We believe the changes we have made will help us to elevate our performance as we head into the second half of the year and to make significant progress in our key priorities of growing MTV\u2019s ratings, improving profitability of Rock Band, and increasing our return on invested capital at Paramount Pictures. We have an unparalleled stable of entertainment brands. As we continue to build their value around the globe while further strengthening our balance sheet, Viacom is well positioned for better times ahead.", "And now, I will turn it over to my partner, Tom, to provide some detail on our financial results.", "Tom Dooley", "Thank you, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing our second quarter results. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning I\u2019m going to take you through our results in much more detail and I\u2019ll update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of the year, as well as our balance sheet and cash position.", "My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude the $33 million of severance charges; $16 million at Media Networks and $17 million at Filmed Entertainment. We believe that adjusted results are a better indicator of our core performance.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at the consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues declined 14% to $3.3 billion as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Total company expenses declined $385 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $297 million and Media Networks expenses declined by $92 million. The declines were principally due to lower production and distribution costs at Filmed Entertainment as a result of the timing and mix of distribution titles as well as lower employee cost at Media Networks.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at our segment results. I will start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues declined 8% to $2 billion in the second quarter. Domestic revenues declined 3% and international revenues declined 32%. Foreign exchange had a 10 percentage point negative impact on international revenues. Page nine of our web deck provides a breakdown of Media Networks revenue performance.", "As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 6% in the second quarter, which was an improvement from the first quarter\u2019s 9% decline. We saw the ad marketplace firm up towards the end of the quarter, and we experienced strong ratings growth and advertiser participation in our awards shows. International advertising declined 27% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 12 percentage point negative impact. The global economic downturn continued to weigh heavily on all international advertising markets.", "Turning to affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues declined 5%. Foreign exchange losses had a 13 percentage point impact on international affiliate revenue growth in the quarter. In terms of the drivers, approximately 70% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases and 30% of the growth was from increased subscribers. International growth was impacted by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches, as well as rate increases.", "Moving to ancillary revenues, domestic revenues declined 27% while international revenues declined 63%. The decline in ancillary revenues primarily reflects lower Rock Band and consumer product sales. Rock Band faced difficult comparisons with last year when we were principally selling hardware as we built up our installed base, including rolling out the game internationally and on the Nintendo V platform. In addition, the soft retail environment led us to recess our pricing strategy and accordingly lower prices on the Rock Band hardware.", "Media Networks\u2019 operating income of $687 million in the quarter was 10% lower than last year. The operating margin declined 90 basis points to 35% in the second quarter. Lower advertising and consumer product revenues as well as a carrying value adjustment on Rock Band inventory negatively impacted the margin. These items were partially offset by cost management initiatives. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margins were 39%, which was an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from last year.", "Programming expenses decreased 1% on a reported basis. The savings from last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring charges benefited programming expense by 4 percentage points. The increase in organic programming expense principally reflects our continued investment in original programming.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to Filmed Entertainment. Second quarter revenues declined 22% to $1.4 billion. Page 11 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues declined 27% in the quarter to $584 million versus last year. Currency losses had a 5 percentage point negative impact on these results. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to higher revenue recognition associated with Indiana Jones 4, which was released earlier in the second quarter of last year, versus Transformer 2, which was released late in the second quarter of 2009.", "Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 29% or $177 million from the second quarter of 2008. Foreign exchange had a 6 percentage point negative impact on worldwide home entertainment revenues. The decline in home entertainment revenues reflects lower revenues from our current releases as well as our catalog titles, which last year included the Indiana Jones Trilogy release.", "TV license fees increased 5% to $314 million in the quarter. Filmed Entertainment generated an operating loss of $8 million in the second quarter as compared to operating income of $86 million last year. The $94 million decline in Filmed Entertainment operating income reflects underperformance related to the theatrical release of Imagine That, difficult comparisons with last year\u2019s release of Iron Man, and lower home entertainment profits.", "These factors were partially offset by lower overhead as a result of the departure of DreamWorks, our restructuring from the fourth quarter of last year, as well as other cost-saving initiatives at the studio. Since few films were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture during the quarter, the impact related to the Epix was immaterial to Paramount and Viacom\u2019s results.", "Moving below the segment results, total company equity losses from investments were $23 million in the second quarter. The losses in the quarter were related to our investment in Rhapsody America and our minority overseas investments. Other items reflect the loss of $15 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses as a result of the strengthening US dollar. We reported tax rate in the second quarter as 36%.", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, our leverage and our debt covenants. Page five of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. On a reported basis, it was a cash use of $16 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we made a decision to reduce our asset securitization program by $175 million. We replaced it with more economic bank borrowings and commercial paper. If you strip out the impact of the reduction in the asset securitization program, we generated $159 million in operating free cash flow in the quarter compared to last year, which had $182 million use of cash.", "Lower working capital uses, lower cash taxes and lower capital expenditures more than offset the decline in operating income during the quarter. From a working capital perspective, recall that in the second quarter of last year we had accelerated our film production in anticipation of a possible SAG strike. In addition, increased receivable collections during the second quarter of this year contributed to the lower working capital use.", "In terms of leverage at the end of the quarter, we had $7.4 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and approximately $250 million of cash and cash equivalents. We ended the second quarter with $750 million drawn on our $3.25 billion bank revolver. We use cash on our balance sheet and unused capacity under our bank line to repay the $690 million of our floating rate notes that were outstanding at their maturity on June 16.", "Of the $7.4 billion in total debt, approximately $800 million or 11% is floating rate and 89% is fixed rate. The fixed rate debt has an average cost of 6.4%. The quarter-end cost of short-term variable rate borrowings under our bank line was under 1%. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3.0 times. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was 6.7 times.", "While the credit markets have improved noticeably in recent months, events over the past few quarters have shown the company\u2019s need to operate at prudent leverage levels to ensure uninterrupted access to the capital markets. Given these considerations, we are now targeting a leverage ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 times.", "There have been questions surrounding the put/call option related to the DreamWorks Library and the potential payout. So I want to spend a moment clarifying this. As you may recall, we sold the DreamWorks live-action library shortly after the acquisition of DreamWorks to a joint venture controlled by Soros Partners. The financing of the purchase of the library by the joint venture consisted principally of debt and a small equity component.", "The debt financing in effect is an asset securitization, since [ph] the debt secured by and amortized with the receipts from the exploitation of the film library. There is a fair value put/call option related to this venture. Upon settlement of the put/call option, the earliest of which would likely occur in 2011, we would expect to pay off the unamortized balance of debt and resume full ownership of the film library.", "The unamortized debt balance at June 30th was approximately $440 million. We estimate that sales currently on the books will reduce this balance to approximately $380 million by the settlement date. Upon settlement, we will own and control the library and the future cash flows associated with it. Assuming this transaction takes place, we will determine the most cost-effective method to carry these assets. We can sell them, refinance them in an asset securitization transaction or keep them on our balance sheet.", "Now I\u2019d like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of 2009. We\u2019ve had great success this quarter with two of our summer tent-pole movies, Star Trek and Transformers", "Revenge of the Fallen. We will see the benefit of these films reflected in Paramount\u2019s results in the back half of the year, since at that point they will have fully recouped their distribution costs and in the fourth quarter we will be releasing them on home video. We continue to expect to realize approximately $200 million in cost savings this year related to the restructuring charge that we took in the fourth quarter of last year.", "In terms of the timing, the savings will be spread relatively evenly through the year and we plan to pursue additional cost savings initiatives throughout the course of this year. On September 9th, Rock Band will be releasing the Beatles game worldwide. It will be available on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and V platforms. While the game will have a small number of new limited edition hardware offerings, it will also be compatible with all Rock Band as well as most guitar hero instrument controllers already in the marketplace. This ability to play the Beatles game using your existing hardware should help accelerate the sales mix shift from a hardware to a software.", "In summary, while the global economy remains challenging, we continue to adapt and execute on our strategic and operational goals. We have taken steps to make our operations more efficient and continue to seek new ways to lower the capital employed in our business. We have strengthened our balance sheet and our ability to access capital, and we have done this while continuing to invest in our content, our brands and in all our franchises.", "With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now we\u2019ll turn the call over to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mark Wienkes with Goldman Sachs.", "Mark Wienkes \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great, thank you. Just wondering how much of the sequential improvement in the domestic advertising results do you think related to your programming that you cited improvements there versus the overall ad market. And then could you talk to the pacings for the third quarter so far given the programming -- ratings improvements have continued?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thanks, Mark. We saw the scatter markets strengthening as the quarter progressed towards the end of the quarter. So for example, some of the cancellations -- in fact, most of the cancellations that we saw in the upfront commitments [ph] that had been made last year from advertisers, those same advertisers came back with those dollars in the scatter market as the quarter came to a close. So there was clearly some stabilization in the marketplace. And as you point out, on a network like BET, for example, where we had a rating surge -- that certainly helps the performance as always, hit shows and great programming will beget greater strengthen in any economic environment, which is why we are so focused on content.", "As we look into the third quarter in the ad market, the slow evolution of the upfront marketplace overall has really affected visibility as we go forward. And the dollars are coming in, and it will depend a lot on the continued stabilization of the economy and hopefully growth of the economy as we go forward and as we strengthen our ratings and our key networks, like MTV where we are seeing some clear turn in the ratings. We hope to perform well relatively in the ad market. We are very pleased for ourselves we are pretty much done with the upfront.", "Mark Wienkes \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks for that. And then I guess on MTV specifically on the programming changes there, I guess could you just talk to what you\u2019ve learned so far with respect to that new filter you talked about? Where do you think the network can improve further? And do you still expect mid-single digit growth in programming expenses for the full year overall?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes. MTV has really done a lot of research on what the millennial generation is interested in, looking for. We\u2019ve made some changes both in programming management and we actually have a relatively recent general manager of the network itself. So they have applied a new filter. We are definitely diversifying the genres of programming that we're putting on MTV. I think that\u2019s important. We had probably too heavy a concentration in particular genres. We are broadening our gender reach on MTV. So it\u2019s really a function of keeping that going, having more coherence in different day parts targeting specific demographics and better scheduling. So all of those put together are already yielding results, which we hope and expect will continue.", "Tom Dooley", "Mark, on the mid-single digit growth in programming expense, as you know, in the third quarter organically we grew around 3% in terms of the expense growth there in programming. And we expect to be well within the target that we set for the year.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks and good morning. Philippe, you mentioned that you\u2019re almost done with the upfront process. So I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the CPM performance this year versus last year\u2019s upfront, how much inventory you plan on selling in this year\u2019s upfront versus last year? And then just a quick question on the Epix FiOS deal. Will Epix be carried as a full premium or on the digital basis here? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Spencer. As far as the upfront marketplace, as I said, we are very pleased with -- under these conditions, with both volume and the CPM pricing that we\u2019re getting. Given the fact that the upfront is still playing out, we have a small amount left to be done ourselves, but the general market has a lot to be done. And out of respect for our advertising agency customers, we\u2019ll hope back on providing specifics for now. When the market is complete, there will be obviously more information that will available in the marketplace.", "As far as Epix is concerned, our agreement with Verizon gives them a lot of flexibility to package Epix in many different ways. This is truly a multi-platform offering; linear, video on demand, broadband and mobile. So they will have the ability to offering on \u00e0 la carte basis. They will be able to include it in bundled product offerings to help drive acquisitions and upgrades of video, high-speed broadband, and phone customers. They're going to make promotional sample offerings of Epix on demand and our broadband offering Epixhd.com for promotional periods of FiOS customers ahead of the launch. And we are going to partner with them to drive awareness and demand for the linear launch in October. So we are excited. We are also, by the way, going to be working with Verizon to create a mobile Epix offering that they would market to their V CAST wireless customers. About 4 million of those today, that\u2019s yet another incremental opportunity.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great, thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Michael Nathanson with Sanford Bernstein.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Thanks. I have two on the cost side for either Tom or Philippe. Tom, first, on cable cost side, can you tell us what the decline in SG&A was this quarter? It had to be pretty steep given the fall in total expenses. So how fast did cable SG&A fall this quarter?", "Tom Dooley", "Mostly due to people costs.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. But how -- it was high-single digits decline?", "Tom Dooley", "I\u2019m sorry, say that again.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "How fast was the rate of decline this quarter?", "Tom Dooley", "We\u2019re probably looking at around 10% to 12%.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then the question will be then --", "Tom Dooley", "And category of people costs.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And that\u2019s sustainable, you think, for the rest of the second half of this year?", "Tom Dooley", "It will pretty much moderate towards the last half of the year.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And what types of cost savings -- when we take a look at the Rock Band change in the business mix, is it safe to assume that the decline in Rock Band revenues or ancillary revenues would be matched by declines in expenses related to Rock Band?", "Tom Dooley", "Actually the revenue decline was one piece of it, as I said, due to the economic conditions out there. We had to take a price point protection on the revenue line and we also wrote down some of the carrying value of our inventory. So when you take the effect of both of them, Rock Band didn\u2019t have a great quarter and impacted MTV\u2019s quarter rather negatively.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then can I ask Philippe or Tom, when you look at Paramount, it\u2019s notable that you guys had much fewer releases so far this quarter and you had some strength, a couple huge hits. What was the change so far in the first half of P&A expense for Paramount this year versus last year? And what can that trend be next year? I was trying to figure out what gets Paramount to a higher margin going forward.", "Tom Dooley", "I think the Paramount margins changed dramatically at the end of the year. Certainly as we get into the home video cycle associated, as I mentioned in my remarks, with the two blockbuster films that we released this year, they will be, as you know, a great deal of a profit. As far as the P&A cycle as it relates to films, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever see P&A cycle sort of be seasonal. I think they will be related to the types of films you release around the holidays and how much you\u2019re putting behind those films. Obviously we spend an awful lot of P&A releasing the product we had in the second quarter. And while it was slightly lower than last year in some respects, that\u2019s always going to have a big impact on how our quarterlies are from a profitable point of view.", "Also you have to take into consideration when the film is released within the quarter. The fact that Transformers was released at the end of the quarter, you had very little revenue to offset a very large P&A spend that took place within the quarter, and those dynamics weigh into it also. So it\u2019s very hard to sort of get a trending model. For P&A, it really depends on the size of the film, when it\u2019s released in a quarter, and another factor that factors into that is whether or not the film is one that Paramount produced or whether it\u2019s produced as a distribution deal for one of our distribution partners.", "\t", "Philippe Dauman", "I might add, Michael, that when you have a big hit franchise, which is in a sequel mode, there is some savings initially in the awareness marketing. Everybody is aware of the Transformers franchise, for example, to a degree they weren\u2019t aware with the first release. So you do get the strategy of focusing on big franchises that have multiple sequels, has some marginal impact on P&A spend you need to drive those movies. And obviously the risk-reward ratio improves tremendously.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi, thanks. A question for Tom. Is it fair to assume that going through the back of 2009 that if your domestic ad revenue decline is down 6 or better that those core margins will continue to expand? Are there any reason they wouldn\u2019t?", "Tom Dooley", "The core margin that I cited about, 39% would be the margin that we would continue to target for the business.", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. But I\u2019m just trying to figure out if there is anything in the results this quarter that would preclude that from continuing, if you were down 6 or better.", "Tom Dooley", "The core margin would be 6 or better is something we\u2019re not going to get into because it\u2019s really just too hard to prognosticate about that. Our lock and load though is that we do manage the business very aggressively to try and maintain the core margins in that 38%, 39% range.", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Sure. Okay. Okay. So question for Philippe, one of the big concerns on your stock and you\u2019ve heard this a lot, I\u2019m sure, and the big worry is that longer-term you\u2019re losing share of the younger people, let\u2019s say, the 12 to 34 demo, given the declines that we\u2019ve seen in MTV. So maybe it would be helpful for us if you just talked about where else in the Viacom cable portfolio do you feel you have had or have the best ability to recapture that demo for ad buyers.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, it all begins with having the right kind of programming. I think if you look at the enormous turnaround that we\u2019ve had at BET, for example, since we made changes in both the programming management and programming and scheduling that in a relatively short period of time, you see a network that was identified as losing its core audience become that actually achieved all-time record rating. Similarly, at MTV, we\u2019re beginning to see the results of the changes in our approach to programming in a much more focused effort there, again, with some changes in key management positions and emphasize.", "We have great strength across our portfolio of brands. COMEDY CENTRAL has become a very important part of our culture. Spike, which is a brand that\u2019s just a few years old, has resonated very strongly with the young male demographic. Nickelodeon, a great franchise. So we have to be conscious of changes in the culture. We have to use our online assets to reinforce our connection with our consumers. We\u2019re doing that very well. And where you hit trouble spots in some quarters you have to address the issue. We feel very good because of our strong\u00a0brands and the way resonate with our demos, 12 to 34, otherwise very good about our ability to continue to reach them because we\u2019re not just a collection of shows, we really are lifestyle brand that targets specific niches.", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Got it, thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Banc of America.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Banc of America", "Thanks. I have a couple of questions. First, Tom, can you walk us through the economics of the Beatles\u00a0for Rock Band? And can you state what the losses have been to date and when you expect to break even with Rock Band?", "Tom Dooley", "We\u2019re not going to comment on the losses to date. The economics of the Beatles will be a mid-to-high teen margin business when it\u2019s up and running. We expect that to be sort of in the fourth quarter when some of the initial marketing impacts are taken care of in the third quarter. It is a unique franchise and we are proud to say that, you know, I think it will be one of -- as Philippe said, it\u2019s one of the more stunning games that\u2019s out there. So we\u2019ll have a unique set of economics. We expect the margins incrementally on other types of product to go about 10 percentage\u00a0points higher as you would roll forward from that. And what we\u2019ve experienced on other similar types of franchises, it was more costly than some in recognition of the Beatles and who they are in the music business.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Banc of America", "And break even?", "Tom Dooley", "Break even, we\u2019re not going to comment on Rock Band specifics, break even or whatever.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Banc of America", "And then also on -- well, just switching gears, on Epix, can you give a sense of what the costs are? I mean, FiOS has roughly 2.5 million subs. You mentioned -- Philippe mentioned the 4 million V CAST subs. But there is a high fixed-cost base presumably. What should we be looking for over the next year or so in terms of costs?", "Tom Dooley", "For Epix, for the joint venture?", "Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Banc of America", "Yes.", "Philippe Dauman", "On the cost side, the majority of the -- the vast majority of cost relates to programming. It\u2019s really the output deals that the studios have. And like most paid deals, they are based on a rate card that is based on the box office performance, the movies that are supplied into the pay window. The operating costs apart from program acquisition costs are, relatively speaking, a very small fraction. It's the management, marketing and promotion. The venture is\u00a0getting a benefit of utilizing our affiliate sales group in terms of distribution and some marketing efforts.", "Tom Dooley", "And the costs are much more modest than any of the other pay ventures that are out there.", "Jessica Reif-Cohen \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. And then I guess looking for clarification on third quarter trends on advertising. It wasn\u2019t clear based on comments on the upfront in the scatter market. If we should put forth further sequential improvement in Q3 or not.", "Philippe Dauman", "It\u2019s still early in the quarter, so we\u2019re not in a position to make predictions. As I said, there has been some uncertainty in the overall market because of the interplay with the upfront market. So it\u2019s just too early. We haven\u2019t even finished the first month of the quarter.", "Tom Dooley", "Dollars continue to come in, in late and very close to airing. So it is increasingly difficult to make longer term projections. So we hesitate to do that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. Good morning, gentlemen. Few questions as well. So another way to sort of ask the Epix question is, based on the deal with Verizon, what percentage of the pay TV distributors would you have to have adopt the Verizon deal for Epix to reach break even? You need half the country on board, three quarters? Where does Epix come out of break even?", "Philippe Dauman", "Doug, the -- we have several advanced negotiations with distributors. We are very comfortable that we\u2019ll have meaningful distribution as we roll it out. And our conservative business plan calls for us to get to break even in relatively short order. Because we are the new entrant, because we don\u2019t have existing margins to protect, because as Tom said we are operating more cost-effectively than the competitors, we really don\u2019t have all that high a hurdle. All the deals can be different, the economies can be different, but it won\u2019t take us very long to get to break even.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And can you tell me on the second quarter, you mentioned you had a benefit from the award shows that were a driver. What would the domestic ad sales decline year-over-year be without the award shows, or how much did they contribute to growth?", "Philippe Dauman", "We don\u2019t break it out on that one.", "Tom Dooley", "It\u2019s very difficult to break it out, especially the way the sales are sold.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right. Let me try one last time then on the upfront, Philippe. I know you indicated you\u2019re not ready to give specific details, but you did say you were very pleased. I\u2019m trying to understand how that\u2019s measured. Does that mean you think your pricing will end up similar to where you think the peer network group will come out or better or was that versus a budget?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we had a tough environment we were heading into as we\u2019re planning for the upfront a few months ago. Sentiment in the general economy has certainly improved. I think the feeling on the part of advertisers that perhaps they could extract dramatic reductions in prices because the economy was going to hell in a handbasket, that feeling has dissipated as we see signs of recovery\u00a0in the general economy. So it\u2019s no longer perceived to be a safe bet to assume that they will be able to get favorable pricing in the scatter market in the next broadcast year. So all that helped us.", "That being said, in the general upfront market, there is certainly some pressure on volume as advertisers want to maintain flexibility in how they plan their advertising budgets. But we\u2019re seeing already that a lot of the money that was taken out of last year's upfront coming back into the scatter market. And as the economies stabilize and strengthen, we feel pretty good about our outlook as we progress through the scatter market in the next several quarters, particularly with the continued vibrancy of our different brands.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we\u2019ll go next to Rich Greenfield with Pali Capital.", "Rich Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "Hi, couple of questions. One, just to understand Epix a little bit more, the way that you\u2019re going to basically profit off of Epix in terms of subscribers, is that -- Epix is going to actually have to sign up new subscribers the way Showtime or HBO does. Someone is going to have to pay $5 to\u00a0$10 or even more dollars per month to Verizon and potentially other multi-channel operators. And then Epix is going to get a share of that revenue. Is that essentially what is going -- how the current structure is going to be? It's not Epix bundling or Verizon bundling Epix in with existing channels and basically pushing the distribution out to a wider audience from day one. I\u2019m just trying to understand that dynamic. And then two, could you just comment on how Paramount is thinking about Redbox. Redbox has been growing rapidly. There was a Sony deal cut last week, and was curious for how you think about the positive and the negatives and how you want to work or deal with Redbox going forward. Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Rich. As far as Epix, obviously, as we do for other networks, we\u2019re not going to get into specifics of the deal economics with this distributor or other distributors. However, as I said, one thing that we do apart from being really the first network that truly is a multi-platform offering across every available distribution mechanism. This, to the extent that others have coined a phrase, like TV Everywhere, we're actually doing it. And the\u00a0way we market our service, program our service, and the way we can structure the pricing for our distributors allows for a lot of flexibility. It\u2019s consumer friendly, distributor friendly. It has -- it drives revenues for our distributors. It\u2019s a value-added product for them and relatively cost-efficient as compared to the competitors.", "So we are structuring our deals to ensure revenue growth for Epix while allowing a lot of flexibility in how the distributors use it, and they like that. And that\u2019s why our discussions with Verizon culminated in a good deal for both sides and why so many distributors, as they learned more, have become more and more interested in the Epix product. As far as the Redbox and other forms of DVD distribution, clearly they have achieved some traction in the marketplace. We saw you noted with interest Sony's deal. And we are in conversations with them and others in how we can together improve and move forward in the DVD marketplace.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Alan Gould with Natixis.", "Alan Gould \u2013 Natixis", "Thank you. I\u2019ve got two questions. First, on the upfront. Can you remind us what percentage of advertising you sold in the upfront last year and tell us if the cancellation terms may be more lenient this year? And secondly, on the film side, you mentioned that there are some production and home video infrastructure changes. Can you expand on that, particularly with respect to the home video side?", "Tom Dooley", "On the upfront, it depends on the network, but we're in the market where we will trade anywhere from 45% to 65%, and in some cases as high as 75% in the upfront in terms of the inventory. Philippe, do you want to handle the other one?", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the Paramount goes, we are in discussions with several other studios and service providers to us. We think that in a part of our organization where we have broad geographic scope around the world, there are a lot of efficiencies that can be achieved. Again, we have changed out the leadership in that group. We have done a top to bottom study. There are a number of improvements in infrastructure we can do on our own, and we believe that there are various back-office functions that do not affect our ability to market and sell our DVDs. But the various back-office functions that could probably be done more cost-efficiently if we did it together with third parties. So -- these are fairly complex discussions. They will go on for a while. They will have most of their impact as we go to next year, but the discussions so far have been very fruitful.", "Alan Gould \u2013 Natixis", "What kind off cost savings do you think you could get from that, Philippe?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we are working that through. We are -- again, we are talking to different parties to see where we can achieve the most savings. It would be on an ongoing basis. Once it really kicks in, several tens of millions of dollars a year.", "Alan Gould \u2013 Natixis", "Thank you.", "Jim Bombassei", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. The final question will come from Imran Khan with JPMorgan.", "Imran Khan \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yes. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Two questions; one related to international, one broad macro. With international market, what kind of weakness you are seeing for home entertainment in the international market? Is it as pronounced as the US? And also given the macroeconomic condition, are you worried about international affiliate revenue? Do you expect that carriers could potentially try to renegotiate those deals? And on the broader macro side, Philippe, you talked about 1 billion video -- online video, and you also talked about the difficulties monetizing those videos. Given the 70% of Internet advertising is search or performance based, are you worried that as we put more content on the web, it will cannibalize your user and you will not be able to replace that revenue stream? Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Imran, for all those questions. Let me try to cover them all. The international economy in many geographies is obviously suffering. In some cases, they\u2019ve declined in a worst way than the US and they have also started declining later, so the recovery in many of these geographies will be later. So we are seeing weakness in the home entertainment around the world that\u2019s comparable to what we have in the US. But again, our focus on the franchise pictures will help us because the -- a franchise like Transformers performs extremely well internationally. And we think the conversion ratio, both domestically and internationally for that DVD and other big franchise pictures will be better than for lower box office pictures.", "As far as affiliate deals internationally, we have -- obviously it\u2019s a territory-by-territory exercise. We have recently renewed some of our most significant affiliate agreements in the biggest territories. But we have expirations that come from time to time. And we\u2019ll see how those negotiations go, but at the same time, we are rolling out new networks. We continue to roll out the Nickelodeon franchise. We continue to expand our comedy franchise. We have new networks such as Colors. We\u2019re looking at others. So, as you look to the long-term future, we\u2019re quite bullish on the long-term build in both affiliate revenues, ad revenues and everything else as economies recover.", "As far as the online part of your question, we do look at how consumers are utilizing and viewing video online. We\u2019ve done a lot of research on how best we can monetize it. We also are looking at the extent to which our putting videos online helped market our shows on air or whether we have a risk of cannibalization. And to the extent we see a risk of cannibalization, we modify the windows, certain shows like the daily show we are able to put online pretty quickly because it\u2019s a refreshening [ph] episode the next day when it\u2019s airing. Other shows have a longer run on-air, so we might put them online later. And we continually tweak the way we put our programming on different platforms to make sure that it is as additive as possible and not cannibalistic. But consumer behavior keeps changing. Our learning keeps evolving and we try to stay on top of the trends.", "Imran Khan \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. Appreciate it.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Jim Bombassei", "We want to thank everybody for joining us on our second quarter earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei; please go ahead sir.", "Jim Bombassei", "Good morning everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our third quarter earnings call. Joining me for today\u2019s discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, Chief Administrative Officer and CFO; and Jimmy Barge, our Controller and Head of Tax and Treasury.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides containing supplemental information available on our website. Before we begin, let me refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. ", "These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Good morning, thank you all for joining us. Viacom continued its steady course of improvement in the third quarter with solid performances from our media network and our motion picture segments. What you are witnessing is a quantifiable benefit of the strategic foresight, the operational and financial discipline of Philippe, and the entire Viacom management team. ", "By keeping a sharp eye on costs, while continuing to invest in programming, Viacom is in a strong position to benefit as the economic clouds now begin to part. As most of you know, Viacom benefits from a well-balanced asset mix with entertainment content at its core. ", "In addition to advertising our success at creating world-class friends and compelling content help us attract steadily increasing levels of affiliate revenues as well as lucrative opportunities in promising ancillary markets. ", "The result of that expertise is now evident across our entire company. From BET networks which has introduced a new network [centric] and is rolling out a [inaudible] new branding plan for BET that is already attracting a larger share of its core African American audience.", "To MTV networks which is continuing enhancing its stable of great brands like Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and steadily expanding its presence all over to the world. To Paramount Pictures which is benefiting from a creative resurgence coupled with the disciplined approach to the bottom line. ", "They are on a roll having revived venerable franchises like Star Trek, introducing new franchises like Transformers and G.I. Joe and demonstrated the financial benefit of some paranormal activity. As you know there are no subconscious optimism being heard across the media landscape as we begin to emerge from the contraction that set in last fall. ", "Those are indeed pleasing sounds. Speaking for myself, I am very pleased to get the events of the past year behind me. One of the biggest reasons for my renewed optimism is my continuing and significant investment in Viacom because I know that I will like all Viacom shareholders, reap the long-term benefit from the brighter future ahead for our industry and particularly for Viacom. ", "Now let me turn the call over to my very good friend, Viacom\u2019s CEO, and the man whom I\u2019m so pleased to have as Viacom\u2019s leader, Philippe Dauman. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "Thank you very much Sumner, appreciate it and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased you could join us today. Over the course of the third quarter we started to see some of the negative economic trends that we\u2019ve all been dealing with begin to attenuate. ", "While I expect the road to recovery will be a bumpy one, I do believe the economy particularly in the US now is moving in the right direction. The actions we took over the past 12 to 18 months have helped us to strengthen ourselves so that we can capitalize on this emerging recovery. ", "I would caution that there are still tough times ahead in certain markets around the world including several European countries where we have a substantial presence. Those economies appear to be lagging the US but as they improve we will be well prepared to take advantage of their recovery. ", "Our overall revenues in the quarter remained a bit soft, but the structural changes we\u2019ve made to streamline certain operations and our ongoing vigilance on controlling costs boosted our profitability and helped us to expand margins. ", "We generated a string of major hits during the quarter across all platforms. On the big screen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, were huge successes. MTV\u2019s Video Awards show broke records on air and online. The global launch of The Beatles: Rock Band, eclipsed the competition in its first month on the market. ", "And in September programming on Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV, and Spike took home six prime time Emmy Awards. During the quarter we made demonstrable progress on the three key priorities I highlighted during our second quarter earnings conference call. ", "We delivered notable improvement in the ratings trend for MTV, the economics of our Rock Band franchise are improving, though not as quickly as we\u2019d like, and we have a much improved profit picture for Paramount. ", "In addition we capitalized on favorable interest rates to replace some of our long-term debt. We significantly improved our overall debt maturity profile and further strengthened our balance sheet. This morning I will quickly review our results. ", "Then I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on Paramount Pictures and its strong momentum. I\u2019ll review some of the highlights from our cable networks and Tom will provide addition details on the numbers. Then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. ", "So let me begin with the results, our consolidated revenues declined 3% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter. In the media networks segment revenues were flat. We continued to see sequential improvement in the advertising market as we moved through the third quarter. Our domestic ad revenues were down 4%, a two-percentage improvement over the second quarter. ", "Worldwide affiliate fees grew 10% in the quarter reflecting both rate and subscriber increases. Ancillary revenues declined 3% for the quarter as lower sales of home entertainment and consumer products, which reflect ongoing softness in the retail economy, offset the strong revenues generated by the launch of The Beatles: Rock Band. ", "Revenues for the film entertainment segment were down 6% in the quarter primarily due to continuing declines in the home entertainment market. As I\u2019ll discuss in a few minutes, theatrical revenues were up double-digits on the strength of our slate, which helps fuel significant growth in the studio\u2019s profitability. ", "Viacom\u2019s adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $421 million for the quarter, a 24% rise over the third quarter of 2008. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.69, 25% higher, then last year\u2019s adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55. ", "We feel good about our results this quarter and we continue to eye the near-term with cautious optimism. Historically our full year results are weighted to the fourth quarter and we, like many other companies, are waiting to see how the consumer behaves this holiday season. ", "Meanwhile we will continue to keep a firm hold on costs while investing prudently in brand building activities. Today I\u2019d like to start our discuss with the film entertainment segment. Paramount had a strong quarter as its strategy to improve its return on capital began to yield dividends. The rationalized slate strategy is clearly paying off. ", "In addition to being second in domestic market share Paramount is on track to deliver the highest average domestic box office per picture as any major studio this year. As I already mentioned Paramount delivered stellar results at the box office. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has been a worldwide success earning well over $800 million in global box office. It remains the number one movie of the year domestically, and it was the highest grossing film of all time in China. ", "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra launched another franchise for the studio and currently ranks as the number 12 movie of the year domestically with more than $300 million in global receipts. The DVD release of these two films, along with Star Trek, will be significant drivers of our home entertainment revenues in the fourth quarter. ", "In fact, in less then two weeks on the market we have already sold 8.3 units of the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen DVD and it is the best selling Blu-ray disk release of 2009 with more than 1.4 million units sold thus far. ", "Consistent with our results the home entertainment market overall remains soft. In our case we had the additional challenge in the third quarter of lapping strong sales of the Iron Man DVD in the third quarter of 2008, without a comparable title this year. ", "As I discussed during our last conference call identifying greater efficiencies in the home entertainment sector has been a priority for Paramount. The recently announced agreement with Technicolor is an important step in that process. ", "Under this new multiyear agreement we expect to save many tens of millions of dollars a year. Paramount has done a very good job of streamlining its infrastructure to take costs out of the system permanently. ", "In addition to the new Technicolor agreement Paramount has integrated the marketing groups for both theatrical and home entertainment. This change not only addresses costs, but establishes more continuity in the marketing of the film throughout multiple windows. ", "The studio has also maintained much tighter controls over headcount and reflective of the current environment they are taking a more disciplined approach to new deals with talent and production costs. This renewed focus on improving our return on invested capital, is not in any way impeding our creative success. ", "In fact, it is leading to more innovation in the way we go about our business. A recent example is the incredible success we are enjoying with a very low budget film, Paranormal Activity, which is scaring people into theaters in huge numbers with over $85 million in domestic box office so far. ", "The inspired marketing approach illustrates the breadth and prowess of our marketing team. Over the last few months this team created and executed a comprehensive campaign for a large budget blockbuster, Transformers, pushing it to number one at the box office and a quiet, relatively inexpensive viral campaign for a very low budget Paranormal Activity, that empowered the audience, spread like wildfire, and pushed it to number one at the box office. ", "Finishing out this year will be Jason Reitman\u2019s Up in the Air, staring George Clooney and Peter Jackson\u2019s, The Lovely Bones. Our 2010 slate is in great shape with several tent poles including Martin Scorsese\u2019s Shutter Island at the beginning of the year, and Iron Man 2 and Shrek Forever After in May. ", "We\u2019re also very excited about the summer time release of our Nickelodeon tent pole, M. Night Shyamalan, The Last Airbender. Before I move on to media networks, I also want to note the launch of Epix which debuted last Friday. Epix is close to additional distribution announcements, which I had hoped to make around now, but the conclusion of these negotiations while they are going well, is taking just a little longer. ", "Now let\u2019s move on to our cable networks, our media networks segment delivered solid results in the quarter despite ongoing softness in the advertising market. The value of our brands and the strong relationship our audiences share with those brands are unique and we continue to explore new ways to monetize that relationship. ", "Our advertising revenues continue to reflect marketer\u2019s preference for just in time buying. The scatter market was quite active throughout Q3 and so far in Q4 with increasing scatter premiums. With so much business yet to be written in the scatter market throughout the industry however, visibility on the depth and strength of the scatter market over the remainder of the quarter remains limited. ", "For us hits matter across all sectors of our business, and the advertising results for our major hits reflect that truth. Successful tent pole events such as the VMA\u2019s, continue to be winners with year over year gains. Our marketing partners recognize that these events are can\u2019t miss opportunities to reach their target audiences. ", "Our brands also provide great value to our affiliate partners and we continue to invest in high quality content and to develop innovative product that drives their multiplatform businesses and maximize new experiences. ", "As I have said before we need to be fairly compensated for the value we provide yet today, we continue to capture more than 20% of the cable viewing audience but only receive about 8% of the license fees. Clearly our networks are vastly undervalued relative to their share of viewership at on demand performance. ", "We remain very focused on closing this gap, pursuing new revenue opportunities and working to ensure that we share with our affiliate partners in the success of the branded content we provide. Now let me spend a few minutes on some of our core networks. ", "Nickelodeon celebrated its 30th anniversary by unifying all of its on air and online properties under the single global brand of Nickelodeon. On air, Noggin became Nick Jr., and the [N] became TeenNick. This one brand philosophy signals the network\u2019s move towards serving the whole family through TV, online, consumer products, recreation and theatrical and in doing so growing this business across demos, geographies, products, and services. ", "We will continue to build on our biggest successes, for example, the ultimate SpongeBob\u2019s Sponge Bash weekend averaged nearly three million total viewers throughout the weekend, more then 30% higher then the day part average for the quarter. ", "And the iCarly tent pole event iFight Shelby Marx, drew an average of nearly eight million total viewers, a new record for an iCarly telecast and the number one telecast of all TV among kids and tweens during its premier week. ", "We are also developing new opportunities for these brands. For example, we\u2019re expanding our offering of iPhone applications, building on the success of apps like the SpongeBob Tickler which has sold well over a million downloads. We have new apps launching in the coming months based on hit shows like iCarly and VH1\u2019s, I Love the 80\u2019s.", "Investing in new content is an important component of our brand building activities. Our recent acquisition of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a great investment for the future at a relatively low price point. It will create value across Nick\u2019s platforms globally on television, in consumer product, online, and on the big screen for Paramount. ", "We believe we have the creative and marketing assets in place to revitalize this once vibrant franchise. We really like the risk/reward profile of this $60 million acquisition. We also intend to increase our investment in original animation to create animated programming not just for Nickelodeon but also family and adult oriented animation for MTV, Comedy Central, and Nick at Night. ", "Animation has broad appeal that can be easily shared around the globe. We are working to grow our state of the art animation studio in California as well as our animation support facilities in Asia and elsewhere into a hub for television programming. And are exploring leveraging those capabilities into movie production. ", "Now, as I said on our last call, improving MTV\u2019s ratings is a top priority. We didn\u2019t make real progress in the third quarter as the rate of MTV\u2019s ratings decline decelerated to 3% year over year. Clearly we\u2019re not there yet. As we complete our new programming and scheduling team we are continuing to adjust MTV\u2019s content mix and schedule bringing in more original shows as well as targeted acquisitions that are being used to help lift daytime and afternoon ratings. As we move into the new year, MTV will build a schedule across four nights of consistently [seen] programming by demos. ", "You will also notice a bigger marketing presence of MTV off channel. The network did once again demonstrate its ability to create a watershed event with the 2009 Video Music Awards show. The show was watched by 27 million viewers on MTV, MTV 2 and VH1, up 17% from the prior year. ", "It was the number one show on cable this year in the 12 to 34 demo. Overall mtv.com logged 2.7 million unique visitors on the day of the show which was a 20% increase over the traffic generated on the day of last year\u2019s show. ", "Finally a quick word about BET, its ratings are great. This past quarter its ratings were up 19% and to date in the fourth quarter ratings are up 25%. The bump in ratings over the past several weeks reflect the success of some of the network\u2019s new programming such as the Monique Show, and The Game. ", "Soft sales of consumer products and home entertainment offset the strong sales of our Rock Band franchise. Of course the big news for the quarter was the global launch of The Beatles: Rock Band. As we enter the all important holiday season, we are reaching out beyond the core gamer audience to first time buyers and passionate music fans. ", "We also expect to see continued growth in our downloadable content business. The Beatles music as well as the hundreds of other songs we have available for Rock Band. We now have more than 900 songs available for download and that number will expand to 1,000 by year-end. Consumers have paid for more than 60 million downloads to date. ", "To conclude, through the first three quarters in a very challenging economic environment Viacom has become a stronger company. We have a stronger balance sheet, a more efficient streamlined organization, which will improve further, a revitalized studio, and powerful vibrant and growing media brands. ", "We are very optimistic about our prospects as the economic recovery unfolds. And now I will turn it over to my partner, Tom, for a closer look at the numbers. ", "Tom Dooley ", "Thanks Philippe and good morning everyone. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to review our earnings release and the web presentation summarizing our third quarter results. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning I\u2019m going to take you through our results in more detail and I\u2019ll update you on the key factors impacting the fourth quarter. ", "I\u2019ll also talk about our balance sheet and cash position, as well as our recent activity in the debt markets. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations which exclude from the third quarter of this year the loss associated with the tender for our 5.75% senior notes which was $84 million on a pre-tax basis and $52 million after taxes. ", "This loss was more then offset by $74 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to prior year\u2019s audit settlements. As a reminder, last year\u2019s audited adjusted results also excluded $46 million of discrete tax benefits. ", "We believe that adjusted results are a better indicator of our company\u2019s core performance. Now let\u2019s take a look at our consolidated results. ", "From a total company perspective revenues declined $91 million or 3% to $3.3 billion as compared to the third quarter of 2008. Foreign exchange accounted for 2% of the decline. Media networks revenues were essentially unchanged while filmed entertainment revenues declined $85 million or 6% principally due to lower home entertainment revenues. ", "Total company expenses declined $186 million for the quarter. Filmed entertainment expenses declined $173 million and media network expenses declined $16 million. Decline at filmed entertainment was principally due to lower distribution and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical releases in the quarter. ", "Consolidated operating income increased 14% to $784 million in the quarter. Now let\u2019s take a look at our segment results. I will start with the media networks group. ", "Media networks revenues were flat at $2.1 billion in the third quarter. Domestic revenues increased 1% and international revenues declined 4%. Foreign exchange had a six-percentage point negative impact on international revenues. ", "Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of media networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned domestic advertising revenues declined 4% in the third quarter which was an improvement from the second quarter\u2019s decline of 6%. ", "We saw the ad marketplace continue to firm up as we progressed through the quarter and we benefited from improving ratings trends at some of our core networks. International advertising declined 18% in the quarter with foreign exchange negatively impacting the growth rate by six percentage points. ", "The global economy is difficult to forecast but at this point international advertising seems to have hit a low in June and has shown progress since then. Turning to affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 11% while international revenues increased 8%. Foreign exchange reduced international affiliate revenue growth by nine percentage points in the quarter. ", "In terms of the drivers, for domestic affiliate revenues nearly 80% of the growth was from rate increases while approximately 20% of the growth was from increased subscribers. International growth was impacted by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches as well as rate increases. ", "Moving to ancillary revenues, domestic revenues declined 6% while international revenues increased 2%. The decline in ancillary revenues reflects lower home entertainment and consumer product sales partially offset by higher Rock Band revenues due to the worldwide release of The Beatles game on September 9.", "Media networks operating income of $773 million in the quarter was 2% higher then last year. The operating margin improved approximately 60 basis points to 36% in the quarter. If you exclude Rock Band the core margins were 40% which was an improvement of approximately 200 basis points from last year. ", "The improvement in the core margins can be attributed to the growth in affiliate revenues as well as lower employee costs which were partially offset by lower advertising and home entertainment revenues. ", "Programming expense increased 2% on a reported basis. If you exclude the savings from last year\u2019s fourth quarter restructuring charge, programming expense increased 4%. Now turning to filmed entertainment, third quarter revenues declined 6% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of filmed entertainment revenues. ", "Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 16% in the quarter to $361 million versus last year. Currency losses had a seven-percentage point negative impact on these results. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strong performance of Transformers 2, which was released on June 26 as well as the current quarter\u2019s theatrical release of G.I. Joe. Partially offsetting this was lower revenues from third party distribution titles. ", "Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 21% or $124 million from the third quarter of 2008. The decline principally reflects lower revenues on distribution titles with Monsters and Aliens released this year compared to Iron Man in the third quarter of last year, as well as lower revenues on catalogue titles. ", "TV license fees declined 8% to $316 million in the quarter reflecting the title mix of available film products. Filmed entertainment generated operating income of $69 million in the third quarter as compared to an operating loss of $19 million last year.", "The $88 million improvement in operating income principally reflects the performance of Transformers 2 for which P&A costs were largely expensed in the second quarter and lower costs associated with the current quarter\u2019s theatrical releases as well as other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower home entertainment profits. ", "Paramount benefited from fewer films released this quarter as well as earlier release pattern for the films as compared to last year. Turning to corporate expenses, were up $6 million in the quarter. Appreciation in the price of our stock resulted in increased equity based compensation and benefit costs. ", "If you were to exclude those costs expenses were essentially flat in the quarter. Moving below the segment results, total company equity losses from investments were $1 million in the third quarter which compares to a loss of $32 million last year. ", "The year over year change was principally related to lower losses on international minority investments. As I mentioned before we had a pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of $84 million in the quarter related to the successful tendering of $1.3 billion of our 5.75% senior notes which were due in 2011.", "Other items reflects a loss of $13 million which compares to a loss of $23 million last year. The lower loss in the quarter reflects lower foreign exchange losses. The reported tax rate in the quarter was 23%. The reported tax rate was impacted by $74 million in discrete tax benefits. If you exclude the discrete tax benefits, the year to date effective tax rate is 36%.", "Also please note that discontinued operations includes a $20 million benefit resulting from Viacom being released as a guarantor on certain Blockbuster lease obligations. Now let\u2019s turn to cash flow, our leverage and our debt covenants. Page six of the web deck presentation provides the component of free cash flow. ", "We generated $621 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter compared to $564 million last year. During the quarter we completed a tender offer for our 5.75% senior notes paying a premium in the aggregate of $84 million to the bondholders. Therefore, on a reported basis we generated $537 million of free cash flow in the quarter. ", "Higher operating income and lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher working capital uses during the quarter. The working capital use was primarily due to a contribution made to our pension plan. During the third quarter we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our debt maturity profile. ", "We took advantage of the attractive rates in the public debt markets, issuing a total of $1.4 billion in new fixed rate debt spread out amongst five, six and 10-year maturities at rates between 4.25% and 5.625%. We also successfully tendered a further $1.3 billion of our 5.75% senior notes that were due in 2011, leaving $193 million outstanding. ", "Page eight of the web presentation shows our debt maturities. As you can see we have no [substanitive] maturities until 2014 and we have built in annual savings on the refinanced debt of $12 million. Our bank revolver matures at the end of 2010 but given the free cash flow we will generate, there should be minimal outstandings at the time of refinancing. ", "In terms of leverage we have $6.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $250 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30. At the end of the quarter our $3.2 billion bank revolver was undrawn. ", "Of the $6.9 billion in total debt approximately $6.6 billion or 96% is fixed rate. The fixed rate debt has an average cost of 6%. The only short-term variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end were approximately $200 million of commercial paper. ", "Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5x which is within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter our interest coverage was 7.1x.", "Now I\u2019d like to talk about some of the factors impacting the fourth quarter. Our highly successful summer tent pole movies released on home video in our fourth quarter. Transformers 2 was released on October 20. G.I. Joe is out today and Star Trek will be released on November 17.", "The profits associated with these home video releases will benefit the fourth quarter of this year with no comparable releases in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. At media networks, the addition of new programming in the fourth quarter at certain key networks will slightly increase programming expense growth from the third quarter levels. ", "However, overall margins at this segment will not be negatively impacted given the continued benefit from our cost savings initiatives. In summary, while we are still dealing with the challenging economic environment we have made progress on a number of fronts. ", "At our media networks group we have improved the ratings on several of our core channels and we continue to deliver on our promise to more fully monetize our networks with our distribution partners. During the quarter Rock Band released The Beatles game to worldwide critical and consumer success. ", "Despite a soft advertising and retail environment we have been able to improve our core margins reflecting a continued focus on rethinking how we do business and how we operate more efficiently. At filmed entertainment we have worked diligently to improve the returns in this business. ", "We have rationalized our film slate putting a focus on developing franchise films that undergo a stringent green lighting process and we have pulled capital out of our business by rationalizing our production deals and reducing our overhead. ", "From a capital structure standpoint we have continued to strengthen our balance sheet locking in long-term financing at very attractive rates removing short-term refinancing risk while at the same time deleveraging the company. ", "We continue to generate significant amounts of free cash flow which we believe drives shareholder value. With that I want to thank you for listening, and now we turn the call over for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Imran Khan \u2013 JPMorgan", "Imran Khan \u2013 JPMorgan", "Good quarter, two questions about the sustainability of a couple of line items, so in terms of the programming costs you talked about. Programming costs grew 4% on an adjusted basis, as we get out of the recession how should we think about the programming cost growth next year, do we see the cost will increase at a faster pace and secondly you talked about affiliate fees increasing 80% in the domestic affiliate fee growth came from the pricing increase, how sustainable is that pricing improvement when do we start seeing lapping those price increases. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "As far as programming costs we have been able to keep the programming cost growth in the low single-digits. We would aim to maintain programming cost growth at the low to mid single-digit level. We are looking at those costs across the entirety of our portfolio. We adjust our spending depending on where the needs are. ", "There are transitions that take place in various networks as licensed programming comes off for example and we replace it with original programming. So we try to manage it across our portfolio and making sure that we grow the programming costs in accordance with the revenue opportunities for our networks and where the needs are. ", "As far as affiliate fees, as I mentioned in my remarks, we provide great value to our distributors and we are happy to provide great value to them. But we believe we continue to have room to grow from low affiliate fee base to reflect the investment that we are making in programming and in other ways in our brands. Our programming tends to over index in other products that our distributors roll out to their customers such as video on demand and as well as online and other offerings that they put out. ", "So we believe that the, and we are targeting continued growth in our affiliate fee rates and continue to work with our customers to maintain that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "I have two, I think in your opening remarks you said that Rock Band business was improving but not as quickly as you would like it, so can you tell us what disappointed you about the pace of improvement and what should look forward to in the next couple quarters that we can do about it. ", "", "Philippe Dauman ", "We had a great launch. We obviously at this time of year, a great launch of The Beatles product, at this time of year we await the holiday season to begin as the month of November unfolds so we will start putting more marketing dollars together with our retailing partners behind that product. ", "We also generate royalty fees through the harmonics relationship with Activision so to some extent the performance of that business will depend on the performance of our competitor. So we just have to be cautious given that we are entering over the next several weeks a retail season that will depend on how consumers spend their money generally. ", "So we have to be cautious about how it is unfolding. Meanwhile we are continuing to manage that business with a close eye on inventory levels and with a greater focus on software. ", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "If you look at our slide number eight it seems rather obvious the capital structure is in pretty good shape and knowing the cash generation of this business, it seems obvious that in 2010 you will start having some free cash flow to deploy, so when you think about that, how do you consider the buybacks or dividend question in 2010 and what are the triggers for those decisions. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "You\u2019re quite right, Tom has done a great job in managing our balance sheet. We are in a very strong position as I mentioned. We also are a company that is back end loaded to the second half of the calendar year on its cash flow. ", "So as we get into the new year and we evaluate the strength of the economic recovery, as we look at our own capital needs and situation we do have just a couple of off balance sheet financings which get consolidated under the new accounting rules in 2010 but we take that into account, the receivables facility which you are aware of. ", "We do have in 2011 a repurchase of the [inaudible] library, I think that the estimated value at that time is about the $380 million level. So we take all these things into account and clearly after we look at our capital needs and the situation of the economy we will evaluate the return of some of that capital to our shareholders. ", "So sometime next year we\u2019ll evaluate our situation. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just two quick questions, first you mentioned that programming costs would accelerate a little bit in the fourth quarter but that overall margins wouldn\u2019t be impacted. I think in the fourth quarter of last year the core cable margins were unusually high in the 40% area, so should we presume that the core cable margins will be flat in the fourth quarter. And then second, with the fourth quarter can you just talk a little bit about how we should think about ad growth. Should it improve sequentially as scatter pricing improves versus the upfront and how should we think about that given some of the price decreases in the upfront. So I guess should we expect sequential ad improvement domestically in the fourth quarter. ", "Tom Dooley ", "In answer to the cable margin, yes we do feel pretty confident in the cable margins. We\u2019ve been very diligent about controlling the costs and as long as the revenues cooperate we\u2019ll be in the range that you suggest.", "Philippe Dauman ", "As far as ad growth as I mentioned in my remarks, its really too early to tell at this point in the quarter. As you correctly point out, pricing in the upfront is down year on year. The scatter pricing is strong. There is demand out there at the moment. It is just in time demand. People come in very short time before the ads get aired. ", "So while pricing in the scatter market is up double-digits, what remains to be seen is what the depth of that market is as the rest of the quarter unfolds because the entire industry and there I\u2019m talking about both broadcast and cable, sold less inventory in the upfront then they had before. ", "So there is a lot of scatter inventory available and we\u2019ll just have to see how that demand equation unfolds and how the economy unfolds. So its just too early to make predictions. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "Rich Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "A follow-up to the capital allocation question, I mean given that you\u2019re now moving towards north of 40% of your cable network business coming from subscription fees, and those subscription fees growing 10% plus, what is the right leverage as you think over the next couple of years. Should you be actually moving higher from a leverage standpoint or is this really the leverage where you think a business with these type of dynamics should be levered and then kind of a follow on to that relates to Disney buying Marvel over the past quarter, how do you think about the need to buy more franchises. Do you feel confident that where Paramount is going it can go it alone, doesn\u2019t need to invest more money in buying film assets. We\u2019ve heard Summit Entertainment is up for sale etc., just was curious for how you look at acquisitions in the space and use of capital. ", "Tom Dooley ", "Just on the leverage question, we\u2019ve announced the target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 at the end of this quarter or at the higher end of that range. We anticipate moving down into the lower end of that range and a comfort zone for us is obviously very comfortable at the lower end of the range and I think that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re going to run the business for the foreseeable future. ", "As Philippe pointed out that does imply that we\u2019ll have a lot of excess cash to return value to shareholders. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "As far as the studio and the franchises, we are exceptionally well positioned as far as the franchises that we own at Paramount. Just to name a few, Transformers, Star Trek, Mission Impossible, G.I. Joe, Rango the Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp project that we are producing right now which looks great, the Nickelodeon project, Last Airbender releasing next summer. Not to mention Indiana Jones or Paranormal Activity where we\u2019re looking at sequel possibilities. ", "Then we have the overall Nickelodeon franchise with many projects. We did acquire Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for $60 million. That works for us across television and motion picture. And the producer deals that we have are particularly productive ones. Just to mention a few, I don\u2019t want to overlook some of our important relationships, but JJ Abrams, Michael Bay, Martin Scorsese, Warren Michaels, so we feel very comfortable with the strategy and direction of Paramount. We do not feel that we need to acquire product or certainly at a high price point in order to have a successful long-term future for Paramount. ", "So we feel very good about the direction Paramount is taking. ", "Rich Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "Did you have substantial interest in Marvel. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "Well Disney obviously bought Marvel. We still have under our agreement with Marvel, we are distributing five more pictures for them beginning with Iron Man 2 next summer and we believe we\u2019re doing a great job. We have a marketing and distribution team which I believe everybody can see is second to none. ", "So we do a great job for our third party distribution partners. We appreciate the relationship with both Marvel and Dreamworks Animation but our long-term strategy is not dependent on the continuation, obviously the Marvel relationship will not continue beyond the pictures we are contractually entitled to distribute for them. ", "Tom Dooley ", "But we had interest in putting capital in that direction, if that was your question. ", "Rich Greenfield \u2013 Pali Capital", "That was exactly what I wanted to understand. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wienkes \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Mark Wienkes \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You mentioned greater efficiencies in home video vis-a-vie the Technicolor agreements, there\u2019s also been talk about potential joint theatrical distribution or back end consolidation, could you talk to the two or three areas where you think there might be more room for efficiencies in filmed entertainment and then does that relate that at all or how might that relate to the potential expansion into more animated product. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "Well look we are particularly in an evolving environment in the motion picture industry including the fact that right now DVD sales, the conversion rates are down. Some of it is, a lot of it is cyclical. Some of it is secular. So we have to keep a tight lid on overhead and the home entertainment area was obviously a big bucket, we put a lot of focus on it.", "But we continue to look at how the industry is evolving and how we should adjust our overhead to meet the realities of the industry. I mentioned the moves we made in the marketing area. We have to look at the efficiency of our international distribution operations. Again we have a great international network, but there are probably opportunities to either alone or working with some of our existing or potential future partners in various territories are probably ways to make those operations more efficient. ", "So we continue to look at everything and what we look for there as well as our networks operations is continual improvement. We never say we\u2019re done. ", "Mark Wienkes \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "With the rationalized slate though, how do you think about the need to own that distribution. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "We do have, as I mentioned in my remarks, we happily have a situation where we have a high ratio of big hits. Our marketing and distribution organization is tailored to that. But as you suggest, as we have this go forward, we can find some efficiencies and we\u2019ll just have to see how the marketplace develops. We are in continual conversations with others to see if there are opportunities both the suppliers, whether there are some back office functions where it would pay to join with others. ", "We\u2019ve had a lot of discussions over the course of the year relating to our home entertainment group and we are arriving at what we think is the best result for us at this time. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Just wondering as it pertains to contact [inaudible] deals like this Ninja Turtles deal that you did, which in your mind would you say is more of a strategic priority, would it be boosting your presence in the cable TV space and in the boy space for Nickelodeon just given, it seems like competition is heating up at XD and perhaps at the Hasbro channel, or is it as you just alluded to is it ensuring yourself content pipeline in the event that that Dreamworks distribution agreement is not ultimately renewed. I was just wondering which is the higher priority for you. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "The largest part of our business is the media networks segment. That is the driver of the vast majority of our operating income. We believe that there is great long-term opportunity in building our great brands and we haven\u2019t talked very much about the tremendous success of brands like Spike which continues to grow. ", "CMT has been growing its ratings really nicely. So in connection with the Nickelodeon business, Nickelodeon is, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, one of our greatest if not our greatest brands with the greatest opportunity. We will continue to invest. We do have our eye on a number of again, low priced intellectual property opportunities like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We were happy to conclude that deal.", "If there are other opportunities of that ilk, we will certainly look at it and we are happy to invest in a business like Nickelodeon which not only has affiliate fees and advertising revenue opportunities, but has a very robust consumer products licensing and recreation revenue stream that over the long-term we should grow. ", "As well as continuing international growth opportunities. So it is an investment that is very worthwhile. ", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I guess just as a follow-up also there seems to be a lot of demand out there for cable or pay TV networks, are there any scenarios as you look at your portfolio where you would consider selling assets at the right price, or selling cable TV networks. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "We love the cable TV network business. We think we have a great portfolio of brands. We think it is very good to have a portfolio not just a few networks but a broad range of networks that garner over 20% of the ratings so we do not intend to sell any of our networks.

", "Tom Dooley ", "On Epix in the third quarter it had little impact at all. There weren\u2019t a lot of films delivered. It will begin to have an impact in the fourth quarter as both we and the other studios begin to deliver film to it and it goes live on the air. It won\u2019t have a material impact on our margins for the foreseeable future though for any of our businesses. ", "In terms of Rock Band, Rock Band was, had negative contributed to margins in the third quarter. We expect it to break-even or be slightly profitable in the fourth quarter from a margin point of view. It really depends on how many units we sell in the holiday season. That\u2019s what we\u2019re building the business for. The economy has made it tough but we\u2019re out there and we think we\u2019re being very competitive in the space and it really depends, literally on the next three to six weeks.

", "Tom Dooley ", "Right now the best guidance I can give you on foreign exchange is basically that it will look and feel somewhat like the third quarter. It will probably mitigate a little given the current trends of where we are but we still have a long way to go in this quarter and I really don\u2019t have a good window into how the dollar is going to move. ", "In terms of its impact in the other area or the other item line that we showed this quarter, I\u2019d say its going to be somewhere in that range. We\u2019ve done some very smart moves relative to the way we\u2019ve structured our overseas cash receivables and balance sheet that begin to mitigate that as you saw in this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to do that. ", "But you wouldn\u2019t be wrong in sort of modeling it this way on a go forward basis. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "As far as the scatter market, we\u2019re still very early in the quarter. I\u2019ll say this, one, we\u2019re certainly pleased with the fact that while the upfront pricing was down the fact that we have inventory available in the scatter market is a good thing because we are seeing as I mentioned before double-digit premiums at the moment over the upfront pricing. ", "Now at just a few weeks into the quarter we have, we already see while the market is strong you see certain weeks where you have just in a short time you have a surge of extra money coming in a particular week, the next week might still be strong but not quite as much. ", "So the next several weeks going forward will really tell the tale as companies in different industries evaluate their own condition and their degree of confidence in the consumer and in the economy. So that\u2019s really all we can say at this point on that.

And separately on the success of Paranormal Activity, I just wanted to get a sense of kind of how confident you might be able to replicate that strategy in future films in terms of the market income [paying] etc., that you were able to kind of hit it out of the park so to speak and I think you talked about a possible sequel on that. Are you thinking about similar kind of strategy in terms of the production budget and the marketing. It seems like you kind of boosted your P&A spending way over the production budget and then you went [viral] to be able to get the word out and had some kind of limited or staggered releases. I was a little surprised that kind of how well received it was. Can you share with us some key points from that experiment. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "Sure, starting with China, where we had the ability to distribute a film theatrically in China given the franchise that we have we can do extremely well and I will remind our listeners that China only allows 20 Western movies to be distributed legitimately theatrically a year. So we are dependent on titles being distributed there. So we think we can do well in China once China opens up its markets as it should going forward. ", "And we believe as an indigenous industry develops we are hopeful that there will be a regime of greater intellectual property protection so that we can monetize our other revenue windows such as DVDs and that we will also be able to get greater penetration on our networks. ", "As to Paranormal Activity, as Brad Grey likes to say, in show business every once in a while you get a miracle and this one was such an example where you have low budget is not the word, it was extraordinary low budget, it was a movie that captivates viewers which was coupled by a brilliant marketing campaign. ", "We obviously will not be able to have the element of surprise or that kind of discovery for a sequel, just of this film. So our team will come up with the right creative and marketing approach to make sure that we benefit from a sequel. ", "As far as replicating it, we\u2019ll look for opportunities but I don\u2019t think any of these can serve as a model. It took many years after Blair Witch Project to come up with Paranormal Activity and some day there will be another but I don\u2019t think one can count on this as being the model for all movie releases. ", "Unidentified Analyst \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s Equity Group", "Are you going to do anything different DVD release of that title or are you just going to go the traditional route. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "I\u2019ll leave it to our marketing folks to announce their marketing strategy for that. We\u2019re still happily enjoying the theatrical window. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "You talked both about the improvement in the film cost structure, the success of your films so as you look forward do you now see the ability to move Paramount up to peer film margins or is there some structural difference in operations or scale that we should be more conservative in our models as we look forward to the next couple of years. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "As far, and again I\u2019ll remind everyone that we don\u2019t have a television business to speak of at Paramount so that makes it different from its competitor studios, the major ones, and the numbers aren\u2019t always broken out that neatly given how overheads are allocated and so forth. So what we look for is how we operate our own business and how we can improve the margins through a combination of a well thought out development and release strategy and a more efficient organization which as I mentioned before we continue to improve.", "So we do look to improve our margins and then the comparison with our competitors will speak for itself. Obviously a lot of it depends on the performance of the movies you put out in a given year. ", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I guess the source of the question is obviously the profits for films range from $100 to $200 million since 2003 and so I think there\u2019s a lot of folks who think you might be able to break out of that range based on how well you\u2019ve done recently. Is that a fair commentary. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "I can\u2019t make predictions but from your lips.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The other side, I wanted to approach advertising from sort of a different, rather then sort of talk about pacings, when you talk to advertisers directly, there is concerns that more of the ad recovery, quote unquote, the improvements we\u2019ve seen is from easy comparisons rather then incremental advertising spend, when you talk to advertisers do you find that they\u2019re starting to increase budgets. ", "Philippe Dauman ", "Yes we are, it really varies by sector and by company. You see a lot of increases or some companies just getting into the advertising market for the first time, the technology sector. As you look forward long-term that entire sector should be a great growth opportunity for advertising. It\u2019s a very competitive industry. New products being launched at the consumer level. Both online, on mobile so we see growth there on a long-term basis. ", "You see some categories that suffered a lot in the recession such as automotive who are coming back in. Everybody knows that advertising does work and it drives growth for businesses. And on the other hand you still have some sectors and individual companies that still feel a little challenged or uncertain about the future and they have to shepherd their resources. ", "So we work with all of them and we come up with creative campaigns and we maintain relationships both existing and new ones but right now the tone is feeling better but we have to be cautious and that we\u2019re just at the early stages of a recovery. But we do have optimism based on the fact that there are a lot of companies out there that are coming back in and stepping it up particularly in competitive categories.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended March 31. Joining me on today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Administrative Officer and CFO; and Jimmy Barge, our Controller and Head of Tax and Treasury.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our Web site. Let me refer you to Page #2 in the Web presentation and I remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our Web site.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As you can well imagine, I am more than happy to be here today as we share the outstanding results Viacom delivered in the first quarter of 2010. Now just one year ago, we found ourselves operating in a very different, in a very difficult environment. There was, unfortunately, not a great deal of good news to be found, and even I had to reach into my reserve storage of optimism to find the few bright spots on the horizon. But even amid the doom and gloom, I had a fundamental faith in the resilience of our assets [ph] and the resourcefulness of our management team. I have always taken a long-term perspective, one that reflects the experience acquired over many years in this business and more than a few economic cycles. I knew that Viacom would not simply survive the challenges of this recession but that it would emerge stronger than ever. Without question, it has. ", "Now what separates Viacom from many in the entertainment industry is that our business is built on strong and growing brands. We have always understood that content is king and thus, we continue to nurture the value of our brands and to invest in the content engine that will drive our business for many, many years to come and ultimately deliver really great value for all of our shareholders. ", "Now already, we are seeing growing enthusiasm among our marketing and distribution partners [ph] who look to us to help them connect with consumers. New technologies offer many more ways, more ways than ever to share our branded content. And I can assure you, we will engage our audiences on every screen, on every device and in every place on this planet. ", "Today, our strong bottom line results reflect a clear focused strategy, unmatched creative ingenuity, expert operational guidance and an always-disciplined financial approach, and you can count on Philippe and his very capable team to continue to expand on this success and to capitalize on the many new opportunities that surely lie ahead for Viacom. ", "And now, I will turn this call over to Viacom's President and CEO, my forever friend, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us today. We have had a solid start to the year and our momentum is continuing to build. All of the actions we took over the past 18 months to strengthen our business are truly paying off today. With a much stronger financial position, a streamlined organizational structure and a continuing commitment to invest in content, we are poised to take advantage of new opportunities that are beginning to emerge.", "The economic environment is growing stronger each day, and absent any major disruption, that progress should continue at a steady pace. As we prepare for the advertising upfront season, the overall mood of our clients is increasingly optimistic and marketing budgets are beginning to loosen up. We spent much of the past year refining our programming of several core cable networks, and while there is still much to do, I am very pleased with the progress. And we have a very strong film studio in Paramount. Structurally and creatively, it is firing on all cylinders and it now has a rich pipeline of material that will entertain moviegoers for many years to come.", "This morning, I will briefly review our financial results as well as the highlights of our operational performance in our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Given that our investment in programming continues to be a key strategic priority, I will spend some time reviewing what's coming up. Tom will provide additional detail on our results and then we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Let's begin with our results. Viacom's consolidated revenues were down 4% to $2.8 billion in the March quarter due to lower Filmed Entertainment revenues, which declined 18% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are now producing a smaller but more strategic film slate, which will likely result in lower revenues in the short term. Media Networks revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Viacom's net earnings from continuing operations increased 37% to $243 million in the past quarter, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.40 versus $0.29 in the prior year's first quarter. This growth was driven principally by higher operating income in our Media Networks segment. ", "We are also continuing to generate strong free cash flow. And we ended the March quarter with free cash flow up by $246 million versus a year ago. As I have noted several times previously, returning excess capital to our shareholders is an important objective for us. Over the next few months, we will be working closely with our board to determine the most appropriate program to return cash to shareholders. ", "Now on to our cable networks. Our portfolio of branded cable networks is unique in this industry. Through compelling programming, we bring together millions of viewers every day that fall into highly valuable and highly targeted demographic categories. And our audiences are very committed to their favorite programming, which is illustrated by the long-running success of shows like Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, MTV's Real World and COMEDY CENTRAL's South Park. Our affiliate relationships are strong and we continue to expand them in ways that add value to their businesses as well as ours. ", "For example, we are continuing to explore how best to use new products and technologies, such as next-day VOD and dynamic ad insertion. Over the past quarter, we have continued to roll out more high-definition channels, and there is growing interest among our distributors in the idea of importing certain international sales to the U.S. We are also continuing to explore opportunities to bring 3D programming to our brands. This concept is still in a nascent stage and at this point, we are primarily looking at special events, such as major music performances for our music channels and sporting events for Spike.", "Shifting now to advertising. The advertising environment is definitely on an upswing. The mood is brighter and advertisers want to get back into the marketplace to introduce new products and build market share. Our domestic ad sales were up more than 1% on a strong scatter market. Despite the fact that we are still dealing with the impact of a much lower upfront for the 2009/2010 season, our result this quarter is a five-point sequential improvement over the previous quarter, and we see a continuing upward trend. ", "Our work continued on the development of more original programming as well as modifying the programming slates and schedules at several of our core channels. Those networks are getting their voices back. The most notable gains were at MTV, where our audience grew 10% over the prior year. The network boasted 5 of the top 15 original cable series in its target demo of 12 to 34-year-olds: Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, 16 and Pregnant, America's Best Dance Crew and Real World: D.C. Importantly, MTV's ratings were up across nearly every day part. ", "These results are great. But this is still a work in progress. We have a great lineup of programming launching this quarter, including two new scripted comedies: Hard Times of RJ Berger and Warren the Ape. This week, the premiere of the final season of The Hills aired with more than a 20% improvement over last season's premier. And this weekend, we launched 10 on Top and When I was 17, two shows created specifically for the weekend. We are also looking forward to another strong performance around the MTV Movie Awards, which for the first time will allow fans around the globe to generate this year's final nominees.  ", "Nickelodeon continued its stellar performance, with its audience up 5% in the quarter, making it Nickelodeon's biggest audience ever among total viewers. And of course, it continued to rank number one with kids and tweens expanding its lead over its competitors. In the key demo of kids 2 to 11, Nick had 6 of the top 10 programs on all television, led by SpongeBob and iCarly. ", "2010 Kids\u2019 Choice Awards ranked as the second most-watched Kids\u2019 Choice Awards ever, delivering 7.6 million viewers. And we launched two shows targeting the tween audience: Big Time Rush and Victorious. These shows are just getting started. But they are already building impressive fan bases as bona fide hits and further cementing our leadership with the tween audience.", "And a powerful illustration of the success of Nick's one-brand strategy, the rebranded TeenNick and Nick Jr. networks delivered a 17% and 8% increase, respectively, in their audiences in the quarter. The strategy of consolidating its brands under the single Nickelodeon umbrella last fall as successfully reinforcing Nick's leadership as a global brand that serves the whole family.", "And as with all of our networks, Nickelodeon is always looking for new ways to get its content into the hands and hearts of its audience. So in addition to having a Dora application available for the iPad launch, Nick intents to launch 20 additional iPhone apps this year.", "BET continues to hit its stride, delivering another increase in its audience, up 7% year-over-year. Each of BET's major specials posted triple-digit timeslot gains versus last year. In its 10th year, the 2010 CELEBRATION OF GOSPEL was its highest rated ever and again, was television's number one gospel religious telecast. Both the BET HONORS and RIP THE RUNWAY garnered more than 2 million viewers. And BET's regular programming is also setting records. The Mo'Nique Show is the number one late-night variety show on television in black households and 106 & Park posted double-digit gains versus last year and has been the number one music variety show on cable for 11 consecutive quarters.", "Coming up, BET will add original scripted programming to its already successful lineup with the sitcom THE GAME and in partnership with Queen Latifah's production company, Flavor Unit Entertainment, it will produce the scripted series LET'S STAY TOGETHER and the original movie THE COOKOUT 2.", "Centric, BET Networks newly rebranded channel that launched last fall, is off to a solid start. In addition to introducing new programming to its schedule, such as THE STEVE HARVEY PROJECT, Centric will become a Nielsen-rated network in the third quarter of 2010. ", "We are continuing to work on the programming slates at our other networks as well, rebuilding and refining them to better reflect their audiences' evolving interests. ", "For example, VH1 has devised a new programming slate that is centered on three themes that resonate with its adult audience: music, celebrity and compelling real-life stories. This plan calls for the network to produce a significant number of original series this year that reflect this new direction and also happen to be more advertiser friendly. There'll be special programming blocks, such as an evening with Christina Aguilera as well as new reality series like Dad Camp. VH1 is also developing a scripted movie from Flavor Unit Entertainment. ", "COMEDY CENTRAL's ratings showed progressive improvement throughout the quarter with its new series, Ugly Americans, performing very well. We are also very pleased to have secured an extension of the comedic genius of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, which will keep their brilliant shows on COMEDY through the 2012 election cycle and beyond. COMEDY CENTRAL has a number of new show scheduled to premiere in the coming months, including Nick Swardson's Pretend Time; Big Lake, a sitcom produced by Will Ferrell; and a new season of Tosh.0, a show that continues to deliver impressive growth. ", "Our International business continues to improve in both its operational and financial results. We continue to roll out our new international programming models for MTV and Nickelodeon, in which we leverage our scale around the world, while maintaining vital local connections. We also saw a strong performance across our European COMEDY CENTRAL channels, VIVA U.K. and Colors in India. The marketplace in the U.K. is beginning to strengthen. And the world outside the U.S. has finally got a taste of the Jersey Shore, as this domestic sensation rolled into 30 new countries last month.", "Not let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment business. Paramount Pictures had a solid start to the year with two out of the three films we released ranking among the top five in domestic box office. We were very pleased with the strong performance of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island, and DreamWorks Animation's HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is continuing to pull audiences into theaters. As I already mentioned, the studio's total revenues were lower year-over-year. We did have three fewer theatrical releases, and we were lapping the very strong home entertainment release of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in the first quarter of 2009, while we did not have a DreamWorks Animation DVD release this past quarter. ", "Our film slate for the rest of 2010 looks great. We have an unmatched lineup of summer tentpoles that are about to launch. Iron Man 2 will open across the country on May 7. I can tell you that this highly anticipated sequel looks great, and we think audiences will be lining up for more Tony Stark.", "A couple of weeks later, we release DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After in 3D. This franchise has a well-established and huge fan base, and the film was very well received in its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. And finally, the Fourth of July weekend will belong to our Nickelodeon tentpole, M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender, which is also being released in 3D. And that's just the next two months. We have several major releases scheduled in the latter part of 2010 and our 2011 slate is already shaping up nicely. These film slates remain consistent with Paramount's clear strategy of releasing fewer films and focusing on franchise and branded titles.", "Before I close, I also want to note the great progress at Epix. The momentum in securing broader distribution is continuing. Most recently was the announcement that DISH Network is making the network and digital service available to its customers across the country. With the addition of DISH, Epix will now be available in more than 30 million households with more announcements to come as the year progresses. This network is a great example of a next-generation entertainment service. It offers the highest-quality content exactly how viewers today want to consume it: on television, often in high definition quality, online and on their timetable. As more customers have an opportunity to experience Epix and its unique advantages, demand for this service will continue to grow. ", "In closing, Viacom is operating from a position of strength. Our balance sheet is strong. Our operations are efficient and getting more so. Our brands are vibrant. And our strategy is clear. We are 100% focused on developing compelling content to feed the world's insatiable appetite for entertainment. We are operating in exciting times as technology affords us more opportunities than ever to share our content with audiences around the world and to make our brands a bigger part of their lives. ", "Along with these opportunities comes the increasingly challenging task of protecting that content in a world in which access to the best programming is just a click away. We are making solid progress in helping all of our partners understand the new face of piracy and their role in protecting the rights of content producers. We are working closely with cable, satellite and telco distributors who are developing better tools and processes to reduce infringement on their own networks, while providing great new services to consumers.", "In addition, all branches of our government are keenly aware of the importance of reducing piracy. The Obama Administration has been a strong proponent of intellectual property rights, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Administration on its strategy to reduce piracy and protect American jobs in the intellectual property industries. ", "Overseas, we've seen even bolder moves, as legislative and legal victories have resulted in progressive and effective IP-enforcement programs in countries such as France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. We are optimistic about this progress and believe that our vigilance on this critical issue will help us to capitalize fully on the opportunities that continue to present themselves in this new digital age. ", "Now I will turn over to my partner, Tom, who will provide more details on our financial results.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and the Web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail, and I'll update you to the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our Web site should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. ", "Now let's take a look at the consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues declined $119 million or 4% to $2.8 billion as compared to the March quarter last year. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 18% or $201 million as we moved towards a smaller but more strategic film slate, which resulted in lower theatrical, home entertainment and TV license revenues. Media Networks revenues increased $73 million or 4%, primarily due to higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. ", "Total company expenses declined $211 million for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $238 million or 20%. And Media Network expenses increased $18 million or 1%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower participation costs as well as lower print and advertising costs as a result of fewer theatrical releases. Consolidated operating income increased 21% to $534 million in the quarter.", "Now let's turn to our segment results. I'll start with the Media Networks group. Media Networks revenues increased 4% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues increased 1% and international revenues grew 22%. Foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. ", "As Philippe mentioned, Domestic Advertising revenues grew 1% in the March quarter, which was an improvement from the December quarter's 4% decline. International advertising revenue increased 14% in the quarter, with foreign exchange favorably impacting the growth rate by nine percentage points. The growth in international revenues was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets. ", "Turning to our affiliate revenues. Domestic revenues increased 7%, while international revenues increased 17%. Again, foreign exchange had an eight percentage point favorable impact on the international affiliate growth rate.", "For domestic affiliate revenues, approximately 75% of the growth was from rate increases, while approximately 25% of the growth was from increased subscribers. In the March quarter of last year, we highlighted that we had a three percentage point benefit from certain nonrecurring payments. Excluding the impact of these payments, domestic affiliate revenues grew 11% in the current quarter. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to continue their double-digit growth in the June quarter. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of increases in subscribers, new channel launches as well as rate increases.", "Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 22%, while international revenues increased 46%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales and TV licensees. ", "Media Networks operating income of $684 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved by approximately 160 basis points to 35% in the March quarter. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 37%, which was a 100 basis point improvement from last year. ", "Programming expense in the quarter grew 5%. During the quarter, we launched several successful new series, including Victorious, Big Time Rush and The Buried Life. The improvement in the core margins can be educated to the growth in affiliate and advertising revenues as well as our continued focus on managing our cost structure.", "Now let's turn to the Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 18% to $886 million. Page 10 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate can be seen in the current quarter's results, as we released three films theatrically this quarter as compared to six films in the March quarter of last year. ", "Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter declined $16 million or 6% to $267 million. Foreign currency had a five percentage point favorable impact on the worldwide theatrical revenue growth. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 34% to $297 million. Foreign currency had a four percentage point favorable impact on the results. The decrease in home entertainment revenues reflect the performance of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa in a prior year with no comparable title this year. The current quarter benefited from the release of Up in the Air as well as the continuing sales of Star Trek, Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe. ", "TV license fees declined 16% to $259 million in the quarter, reflecting lower worldwide pay TV revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated an operating loss of $86 million, which was $37 million less than the operating loss of $123 million last year. The year-over-year improvement principally reflects lower print and advertising costs as a result of the fewer number of theatrical releases. Since few films were made available to our Epix pay TV joint venture during the quarter, the impact related to Epix was immaterial to Paramount's and Viacom's results. ", "Moving below the segment results. Total Company equity losses from investments were $28 million in the quarter. The losses in the quarter principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The reported tax rate in the quarter was 36%. ", "Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and our debt profile. We generated $382 million in free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $136 million last year. Page 4 of the Web deck provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in free cash flow was due to higher operating income and a favorable working capital variance, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. ", "The favorable working capital variance was principally due to reduced feature film participation payments. Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this any commercial paper marketplace with an annual rate of about 35 basis points. We've had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.", "Our strengthened financial position has enabled us to access the capital markets on an extremely cost-efficient basis, which made it very advantageous to bring DreamWorks funding back onto our books. As a result, we again have a complete ownership of the 59 films in the DreamWorks live-action library, including titles like Meet the Fockers, War of the Worlds, Saving Private Ryan, Castaway and Gladiator. With the consolidation of DreamWorks funding, we added to our balance sheet approximately $400 million of debt. ", "The favorable rates available to us in the debt marketplace also made it advantageous for us to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program earlier this month. Going forward, to the extent that we have working capital needs, we will access the commercial paper marketplace or our bank line. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and $358 million of cash and cash equivalents. ", "At March 31, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio the end of the quarter was 2x, which is at the low end of our targeted range. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 8.2x. ", "In summary, it has been encouraging to see continuing signs of improvement in both the economy as well as the advertising environment. The downturn was difficult but we emerged more focused and financially sound company. We are looking to build the progress we have made over the past year, as we continue to invest in our brands and our franchises in order to drive long-term growth. At the same time, we will continue to seek ways to drive efficiencies and enhance our margins. Our balance sheet is in great shape and our debt profile is secure. We will continue to focus on managing our working capital and capital expenditures in order to drive our free cash flow. ", "With that, I want to thank you for listening. And now, we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "Philippe, as your balance sheet continues to strengthen throughout the year, I was just wondering if you could remind us of your content acquisition strategy. And we've seen some content deals in the cable, pay TV space recently. And I was just wondering the types of deals that you're looking at or might consider moving forward.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, the last acquisition that we made was the $60 million acquisition of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, which we think will be a good one for both Nickelodeon and Paramount. And they're both working already on developing TV series and a film franchise, respectively. We continue to look at opportunities of that kind to the extent they're out there, but they're all small in amount and really just additive to our core business. So we don't see -- we continue not to see any major acquisitions in our future.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "And then Tom, you had mentioned the recurring affiliate fee growth of 11% in the current quarter and double digit for the June quarter rather. I was wondering, how long can we expect that level of affiliate fee growth moving forward, particularly for this year and into the full year 2011?", "Thomas Dooley", "Well, we don't provide guidance that far out. But we are pretty comfortable with the affiliate deals that we have signed with our distribution partners that they will be able to provide us with very strong affiliate growth for the foreseeable future.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "And those deals, if they're multi-year deals, do they decelerate? Or is it a straight-line growth trajectory built into those deals?", "Philippe Dauman", "Anthony, we don't disclose -- this is Philippe. We don\u2019t disclose what the rate increase is with different affiliates, so let's just say that we're comfortable. They are, as you point out, multi-year deals. They're also layered so that we don't have a significant proportion of our deals coming to in any given year. And we're quite comfortable with the high-single digits, low-double-digit rate of growth for the foreseeable future, as Tom indicated.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "The first maybe for Philippe on the advertising outlook. You talked about how things are probably looking sequentially better in 2Q. Was wondering if you could give us a sense of you're pacing domestically in the second quarter in the U.S. and also talk a little bit about international just given some of the issues in Europe. And my second question relates to returning capital to shareholders. Historically, Viacom has been a buyer of the stock, as opposed to paying out recurring dividend. So I guess the question is, is that the main method that the board is thinking about returning capital? And is your target leverage ratio based on gross debt or net debt?", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the advertising outlook, as I indicated, the tone continues to be strong and getting stronger out there. You see it every day with new products being launched where very few products were being launched a year ago. You see a lot of competitive industries. We're seeing strength in categories such as retail, toys and games and many others. Technology categories also looked very good. So we do see continued sequential improvement but it's really too early in the quarter to give any more specific prognostication. As far as the international marketplace, Europe and Latin America have been good markets. And it's very encouraging to see the progress in the advertising market in major European territories, notably the U.K. and also Germany. As far as returning capital to shareholders, since we were out of the market since the beginning of last year in our buyback program, we looked at this with our board as a fresh opportunity to consider and put everything on the table. And we are progressing with that analysis. We are moving toward the second part of the year where we get the majority of our free cash flow. So the opportune time for us to come up with the right program of returning capital to shareholders would be over the next few months. And we'll discuss with the board and determine the how and when.", "Thomas Dooley", "And Spencer, the last question on our target leverage ratio is based on gross debt. And we work with all the different rating agencies as to how they define the leverage ratios and we've been working very hard to get the leverage ratio down in any way that it can be defined, including by working to eliminate guarantees that we had provided on the books, such as the guarantees that we had provided under the Blockbuster leases. They're all but eliminated on our books. So in every way you can define it, we're working to drive that leverage ratio down.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "And it includes capital leases, Tom?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, it does.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Philippe, Tom, further question on advertising. It's obviously encouraging that advertising's rebounding and I think we're all trying to figure out what the new normal growth might be for you, especially on the eve of the upfront. So you've had a stretch where Domestic Advertising grew less fast than peers. Do you think that was a function of your ratings performance or a function of the health of the ad categories that are that are sort of your relatively younger demographics that might be more impactful will to Viacom? And then obviously, core ratings are now proving. Do you think you'll start to narrow that gap and start grow online with peers again as you look forward?", "Philippe Dauman", "Doug, there certainly were ratings issues, particularly at one of our core networks, namely MTV. That's why it is so encouraging to see the great strength in MTV's ratings. I mentioned that our ratings were up 10% in MTV in the first quarter. Also, in the first four weeks of this quarter, we are continuing to increase ratings at a double-digit clip. And that's before we have some of our additional new shows being launched. So that is certainly quite encouraging as we head into the upfront season. Hits definitely drive. They drive ratings and they ultimately drive advertising sales. What will really help some of our networks will be when the motion picture category, you see the gradual increase in the number of releases as we go forward as more production activities, more mini majors putting out films like the new DreamWorks and CBS films and Summit and others because we have tremendous strength in that category and that's obviously a very important category. So as that gradually picks up, that will also give us a lift. So we're feeling very optimistic. We think the tone going to the upfront is quite strong. And it will a happier time for sellers of advertising this upfront season than it was last year.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "On international, it seems the rebound has just begun. Do you see the potential for a return to double-digit growth, at least in a short rebound period?", "Philippe Dauman", "You're talking about international now?", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes.", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, our international business is a much lower margin business, obviously. So we do see signs of strength in key territories, international, which lag a little bit the U.S. recovery. And we're continuing to grow and launch networks abroad. So we look to bring our international margins back up into double-digit territory and view this as a source of long-term value creation for Viacom.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Imran Khan, JP Morgan.", "Imran Khan - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "You have done a pretty good job growing your core margins and managing cost. Tom, could you please give us some color how should we think about how much cost-cutting opportunity left in the company? How should we think about the core margins going forward? And secondly, on the ancillary side of the business, I think on Rock Band's last addition you lost some money. Going forward, that you're outsourcing the hardware component, how should we think about the profitability of ancillary segment of the business?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, on the core margins going forward, we continue to look at the way we do business in the company and we continue to shift the business more to a digital focus, which does provide us with opportunities to continue to cut costs. And as we've said, we'll invest more in programming but keep a very watchful eye on our bottom line so we can drive the overall margin growth of the company into the foreseeable future. And we've been very successful at that and we will continue to do that. Rock Band, we've done a lot of things in this quarter to improve the Rock Band business. And one of them was what you've just mentioned of the outsourcing the hardware component in terms of the production and inventory management of that to a company called Mad Catz. That will substantially reduce any inventory risk we have associated with that. So those are all positive steps. And we would hope that Rock Band will move to being a profit contributor sometime in the calendar year.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Alan Gould, Soleil Securities.", "Alan Gould - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "Was wondering on the Domestic Advertising, could you tell us in the first quarter, what percent of that ad revenue was generated from the upfront market? What percent was generated from the scatter market? And how does that change as we move through the year?", "Philippe Dauman", "Alan, as I mentioned in the previous earnings call, the upfront sales has its highest proportion in what was the first quarter of the upfront, which was the fourth calendar quarter. So it's a lesser proportion of overall advertising sales in the quarter just completed. And that trend continues. So as we go forward and particularly, as we go into the '11 fiscal year, which begins October 1 for us, we will get the benefit of the next upfront. And we are very much looking forward to that.", "Alan Gould - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.", "So Philippe, for the remaining two quarters of the year, should we assume less than half that ad revenue was sold in the upfront market?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we don't break it down in that way. But all I can say is that as the year progresses, there is a modestly, each quarter, diminishing portion of the inventory that's sold at the upfront prices. However, because of the strong pricing in the scatter market, you are seeing actually a historically low level of cancellations of upfront purchases. So the lower-priced inventory is not going down as a result of advertisers canceling or exercising their options.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "I was wondering if we could get a little bit more color on Epix, some benchmarks we can look forward to. You finally got a really big national carriage deal. Any sense of some of the remaining players, when you would expect to have deals completed? And then I guess, what do you view as the, maybe either number of homes passed or number of subscribers, some kind of benchmark that'll help us figure out when you get to breakeven on the business, if you can give us some more color?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we're very pleased with the progress of Epix. As you point about, DISH is certainly a major new distributor to add to our lineup, which includes for Verizon, Cox, Charter, Mediacom, NCTC and the list will continue to grow as the year progresses. So we are very much on track to increase our distribution to the point where we will reach breakeven and beyond in the next calendar year, in 2011. Our deals, generally speaking, are structured in a way where we have a minimum level of revenue with upside potential for us, although the deals do vary from distributor to distributor based on their own -- the way they market their services, generally, and what their particular needs are. And one of the attributes that we bring to distributors is the flexibility of that base, both as a consumer platform and as a marketing opportunity for our distributor friends.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.", "Jason Bazinet - Citigroup Inc", "Over to Paramount, I think you guys distribute quite a few films that you don't produced and some of those distribution agreements I think are expiring for various reasons. Can you just summarize those for us? And then give us a sense, do you think there's the prospect backfilling that with news studios where their distribution agreements come up? Or do you think it's more prudent for us to begin to moderate sort of the revenue and operating income you're generating from those agreements?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, Jason, the two principal distribution arrangements that we have at Paramount are Marvel, which of course the producer of Iron Man 2, which is coming out at the end of next week. We have, under that agreement, up to four more titles after Iron Man 2. We don't anticipate that to be renewed given that Disney acquired Marvel. DreamWorks Animation, we have an agreement that covers titles released into 2012, with Shrek coming out in a few weeks and later this year, Megamind. It's a very fruitful relationship. I just happened to be talking to Jeffrey yesterday, and he was complimenting the Paramount organization, which is world class and top-of-class in marketing and distribution and how well HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is holding up, such that in the fifth weekend of release, it was a number one movie and doing well internationally as well. We also do distribution for other companies, independents in various territories around the world. And we expect that to continue. As we've built up our international distribution organization, we've been disturbing a lot of local product. During this period, we've built up our own pipeline of great franchises and also building up our Nickelodeon and MTV films lineup so that either way, as the future unfolds, we have a very vibrant pipeline of what I would consider better risk-reward profile movie releases.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer and Company.", "Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just little bit of a longer-term question as well, so seems to us that some of your competitors are being liberal in licensing their content to new distributors such as Netflix and Hulu for potentially less than fair value, which I know we're all trying to figure out what that fair value is. Can you talk about how you guys see the future of content distribution where consumers want to be on all devices, yet you want to get paid for your content?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, Jason, we do view these new outlets as incremental opportunities. And we want them to be that, incremental opportunities. So we're working with live distribution partners, we're testing, we had a couple of our shows on Hulu. And we'll look forward to their new distribution strategies and models and determine in each case whether it makes sense for us to participate. So television viewings, I've said before, continues to be at all-time highs. And all these new distribution methods just allow people to spend more time consuming our content. And as time goes on, as we work with these new distribution partners on the right economic model and the right model for consumers, we think that will continue, that will drive our content business.", "Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I mean do you see incremental economics to your affiliation agreements to the extent the cable operators want to offer your content on an IP basis as well?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well yes, our content's particularly well suited for VOD and various broadband applications. Our audiences tend to be the young demographics that utilize it more than viewers of other programming. So we over-index in VOD platforms and the like. And that certainly helps us a lot in all the discussions we have with distribution partners, which is one of the reasons why we're able to enjoy the steady and high affiliate revenue growth.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jeff Logsdon, BMO Capital.", "Jeffrey Logsdon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Question for you on the Marvel distribution agreement. Marvel had announced beyond Iron Man 2, Avengers, Captain America, Thor. Are those specific films identified through the agreement? Or is it just four more films and there could be others that are put into that mix?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, those are the ones they have in the pipeline for production and those are covered under our distribution agreement. I haven't read the actual language of the distribution agreement. But those are the movies in the pipeline, which we will be distributing for Marvel.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to a Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne", "I wanted to ask about the kids market the kids' upfront. There's been a lot of chatter over the last I don\u2019t know, six, nine months about how kids' has been trending. And you guys are, I think, either in the middle of or at the beginning of the kids' upfront. Any update there on how that business has been trending and what your expectations might be for pricing even if it's qualitative? And then on the sort of TV Everywhere picture, I was curious if Viacom had a view on how they would like to have consumers' access to online content at MTV networks, if the preference would be to do that through comedycentral.com and Viacom owned and operated Web sites or if Viacom would be willing to go into either a Comcast or Time Warner Cable aggregator, for lack of a better term, online to fill out and maybe make it more easy for customers to access online content? Any thoughts there would be interesting.", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the kids' market, Nickelodeon is entering into the upfront market in a position of maximum strength with growing ratings, doing extremely well in the category. I mentioned a lot of the categories, it's actually trending up as toys and games. And Nickelodeon's aim is to get increasing share of the endemic business of that kind. But Nickelodeon has also made great strides in bringing in new categories of advertisers, given its reach to the entire family, as I mentioned before in my remarks. And that allows us to bring a lot of new advertisers. So the outlook is very strong and positive for Nickelodeon as it approaches the kids' market, which is still in very, very early stages. So there's no concrete data to put out. But we're in great shape as far as the kids' market goes. As far as TV Everywhere, by the way, Epix is probably the ultimate product in the TV Everywhere arena and is really working well for our current distributors and will be a very interesting product for the future distributors who will be signing up. For the basic cable networks, where there is also an advertising component, we are working very closely with the various distributors to test it. There are technical issues. There are measurement issues. For us, it's important that Nielsen or other services do measure the viewing on non-traditional platforms so that we can -- if you can measure it, you can sell it. And as that progresses, we are willing to have our distributors provide TV Everywhere on various platforms, which we will discuss with them. You mentioned our own Web sites. Our own Web sites are also seeing nice growth in both monthly in unique viewers, time spent and the advertising market for our types of sites, our branded sites is also strengthening as we look forward.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to David Miller, Caris & Company.", "David Miller - Caris & Company", "Tom, question for you also on Epix. If MGM should file for bankruptcy and of course, it's unclear whether or not that will happen, they could end up restructuring, going alone, and I understand that. But if they should file, would you be, theoretically, interested in buying in the Epix stake that they currently hold below the line? And is that the reason you guys aren't paying a dividend yet on the sort of theorem that you want to keep your powder dry to perhaps buy in the Epix stake and you just want to wait and see what happens before you start to pay a dividend?", "Thomas Dooley", "Epix is very well funded by all of its partners at this point in time. We don't see any problems. And it's kind of -- it doesn't make much sense for us to hypothesize about what's going to happen there. So I don't think we don't want to comment on that. Both Lions Gate and Viacom are sufficiently in a good position to deal with as Epix's future cash needs. It's doing very well, as Philippe mentioned before, in terms of its movement towards growth profitability, breakeven profitability and cash flow breakeven. So its capital needs are not that significant on a go-forward basis, nor is the amount of money that would be involved with Epix on a go-forward basis impact our ability in terms of our intent to return cash to shareholders in any way, shape, manner or form.", "Philippe Dauman", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended June 30. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer and CFO; and Jimmy Barge, our Controller and Head of Tax and Treasury.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.", "Let me refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website. ", "And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As all of you can well imagine, we are more than pleased to be with you today to share our perspective on the strong results we have seen in the quarter ending June 2010. With six months under our belt in this calendar year, day after day, our confidence continues to grow as the emerging economy recovery builds. Now of course we're not all the way back, but the horizon's brighter than it has been for some time. Consumers are returning to the marketplace, marketers are beginning to spend again to grow revenues and capture share. And Viacom, Viacom with a leading entertainment brand, strong audience connections, is now and will continue to benefit from the upswing in confidence and the upswing in spending. ", "I have a very capable, an insight for leadership of CEO, Philippe Dauman and COO (sic)[CFO], Tom Dooley. Viacom has made investing in programming it's top priority, and that has kept our creative engine very strong despite the difficult environment. As a result, our film and television pipeline is deep with potential new hits and popular returning television series and film franchises, and this have turned exciting ways to driving box-office growth. And thanks to our continued laser focus of enhancing the efficiency of our business, our creative success continues to translate directly to our bottom-line performance. Viacom is generating strong cash flow and returning the value to shareholders as we have demonstrated by our recently initiated dividend program.", "And today's announcement underscores Viacom's clear advantages. What we have is this: we have a smart strategy, we have an extremely capable and disciplined management team, and we have great world-class brand [indiscernible](22:51). The success that we touched on in these results is the [indiscernible](22:56) to the bright future we see not just for this year, not just for next year, but for indeed many years to come. ", "And now, I would like to turn this call over to my very, very close friend, Philippe Dauman. [indiscernible](23:19), Philippe.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have just closed out another great quarter. Our performance over the first half of the year reflects continued progress against our operational objectives. This, in turn, is driving strong bottom line results. Both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment businesses are delivering strong results creatively, operationally and financially. ", "As the media industry continues to evolve and adapt to a digital environment, our singular focus on creating the compelling content our audience's desire across every screen has positioned Viacom very well. While the economic recovery appears to be progressing in fits and starts, a condition that leaves us cautious, we are encouraged by the growing momentum we see in the domestic advertising market. As I will discuss in a few moments, we completed a much stronger upfront than we experienced a year ago. This establishes a stronger base for our next fiscal year.", "This morning, I will briefly review our financial performance and then turn to our operational results in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Tom will provide additional detail on our progress, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. As we review our results this morning, Tom and I will refer to the adjusted numbers.", "Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.3 billion in the June quarter, flat with the prior year's results. Media Networks generated a 6% increase in revenues on higher advertising sales and affiliate fees. This growth offsets a decline in our Filmed Entertainment segment, where home entertainment revenues were down substantially year-over-year, primarily due to the number and mix of titles.", "Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 40% to $418 million in the June quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.68, a 39% improvement over the prior year. The increase was fueled by higher operating income in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment.", "Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow. We had $355 million in operating free cash flow during the quarter, up from $159 million a year ago. The tremendous progress we've made in strengthening Viacom's overall financial position was further validated by the recent upgrades by two ratings agencies. And last month, we were very pleased to deliver a regular quarterly cash dividend to our stockholders. We also look forward to resuming our stock buyback program, which we expect to commence early in the first quarter of our new fiscal year.", "Let me turn now to our Media Networks. Keeping our thing on the pulse of the ever-changing entertainment taste of our audiences is what makes our cable networks so successful. Our ability to tap into and reflect the interest of varied and highly-valued demographics attracts marketers from a multitude of industries. Investing in and developing new content, that is how we continue to build strong global brands. That is how we broaden the reach of those brands, and that is how we position each Viacom network as an invaluable nexus between our marketing partners and the consumers they want to connect with.", "The overall advertising market continues to strengthen. That trend, along with a boost from stronger ratings at several of our networks, pushed our domestic ad sales up 4% versus a year ago and up sequentially over the 1% growth we achieved in our March quarter. Worldwide ad revenues increased 4% in the June quarter as well. The domestic growth came from a stronger scatter market, and while it is still early in the current quarter, we are expecting to see further sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth.", "With regard to the advertising upfront, we went into it this year in a much stronger position than a year ago. Our ratings were up at key networks, and we had new and improved programming slates to show at potential marketing partners. As a result, upfront pricing across our networks increased mid to high-single digits, and we sold just over 50% of our volume, a low double-digit increase over last year.", "Our Nickelodeon Kids and Family Group had a strong kids' upfront, with gains across several major categories. This year, we were able to secure a substantial increase in non-endemic or adult categories, such as insurance and automotive. This shift reflects the fact that Nickelodeon is now firmly established as a co-viewing destination, with more parents watching shows on Nickelodeon alongside their kids.", "Our affiliate revenues continue to grow, primarily driven by rate increases in the past quarter. The multi-year nature of our affiliate relationships will provide us with steady revenue growth for many years to come. In addition, we're continuing to roll out our high-definition channels and extend distribution of our standard-definition channels to smaller affiliates.", "Now let me take a few minutes to review what's happening creatively at our networks. Our investment in programming continues to pay off, helping us to sustain the stellar performance of perennial stars like Nickelodeon, and to fuel the momentum that's underway in networks such as MTV, COMEDY CENTRAL, BET and TV Land. Nickelodeon broke records again this quarter, delivering its biggest second quarter audience ever among total viewers. In fact, the Nickelodeon family of channels now captures more than half of kids viewing on television during its programming hours, giving it a 20 percentage point share lead over its nearest competitor.", "Uber franchise SpongeBob was again the number one rated program with 2 to 11-year-olds and newcomer, Team Umizoomi, was the number one ranked preschool program. Nick had six of the top 10 programs on all of television with both demos. In addition to iCarly's strong regular episode performance, iCarly tentpoles consistently draw record-setting audiences. For example, the iCarly iWon't Cancel the Show premiere was the highest-rated and most-watched telecast of all TV in May among kid and tween demos. That was trumped by the June premiere of iCarly iPsycho, which was the number one rated telecast of the entire quarter across all television with kids. And as the series appears in more countries around the world, iCarly continues to grow into a true global franchise.", "Meanwhile, our newer live actions shows True Jackson, Big Time Rush and Victorious are building their own impressive following. A combination of new and proven programming on Nick Jr., TeenNick and Nicktoons fueled double-digit growth in audience size for each of these networks. Ratings in Nicktoons were boosted by the additional Avatar programming that aired in June, which was part of the cross-network promotional campaign leading up to Paramount's theatrical release of The Last Airbender. Building on this success, Nickelodeon recently greenlit a new series tentatively titled The Legend of Korra, which will continue the evolution of its animated franchise and is slated to premiere next year.", "MTV enjoyed its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth, with four of the top 10 original ad supported cable series among its target audience of 12 to 34-year-old as the network continues to successfully diversify its programming. MTV's new scripted comedy, Hard Times of RJ Berger, has delivered solid ratings that have steadily increased and has just been picked up for a second season. This show has drawn a strong male audience, which is consistent with one of MTV's objectives as it develops new programming. ", "And the good MTV News keeps coming. In the past couple of weeks, two of MTV's most successful new shows return for a second season. Teen Mom, MTV's number one new series in 2009, was the number-one telecast in its timeslot across all television among its core demo of 12 to 34-year-old for the first two weeks of the series. And fans just can't get enough of Jersey Shore. The season two premiere broke all of the series previous ratings records, delivering a 5.1 rating and attracting 5.3 million viewers. It was the number one cable telecast of the year for its demo, and it was MTV's best season premiere rating in more than seven years. While already moving ahead on season three for this phenomenon, it's impact was extended literally around the globe. The first season of Jersey Shore has already been seen in more than 30 countries. ", "Coming up later this quarter, MTV will bring back The Buried Life for another season and debut docu-series, World Of Jenks. In October, the network will air another season of 16 and Pregnant and My Life as Liz. ", "The MTV Networks Music Group is also making innovative moves in the digital space. Late in the quarter, we announced a multi-year partnership with Warner Music Group through which we will have the exclusive rights to sell advertising inventory related to the WMG's premium music video content across our U.S. digital properties and mobile services, as well as on WMG's growing network of proprietary artist sites and third-party affiliate sites. The addition of WMG's video views to our collective total will expand MTV Networks Music Groups' online reach to more than 15 million monthly unique visitors, solidifying the group's position as a leader in the digital music space.", "At COMEDY CENTRAL, we have been revamping our programming lineup, and the audience is responding enthusiastically. Ratings began to turnaround in the month of June with year-over-year improvement of 5%. During the first five weeks of this quarter, COMEDY's total day audience has grown 20% year-over-year. Anchored by the continued success of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which had ratings growth over the prior year, South Park, Ugly Americans, new original episodes of Futurama, as well as Tosh.0, all have delivered outstanding results. Ratings for Tosh.0, now in its second season, have been building steadily and impressively as the show has found its audience. Just last week, Tosh hit a new series high, delivering 2.7 million viewers and further cementing its status as the number-one show among young men on Wednesday evening this summer.", "The success of our linear programming lineup is also driving digital success. The suite of sites that constitute Comedy Central Digital, including ComedyCentral.com, TheDailyShow.com, ColbertNation.com and SouthParkStudios.com enjoyed its best quarter ever. Comedy Central Digital averaged 9 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter, up 23% versus last year and ranked number one in the entertainment humor category.", "Across our networks, we have had numerous other original programming standouts. For example, TV Land's hit sitcom, Hot in Cleveland, its series premiere was the most-watched sitcom telecast in cable history, with nearly 6 million viewers. We've already greenlit a second cycle of the show, which will air in early 2011. This series, along with the upcoming third season of She's Got The Look, is one of several initiatives we have underway at several of our networks to broaden our target demographics, mainly attracting more of the 18 to 49 and 25 to 54-year-old adult market, which will open up new and lucrative marketing opportunities for us.", "BET's The Family Crews and the second season of Tiny & Toya, both ranked among the top original series ever on BET, and The Mo'Nique Show continues to grow its late-night audience. ", "At our scenes [ph](35:42) award shows, including the MTV Movie Awards, the BET Awards and VH1's Hip Hop Honors, all delivered outstanding ratings, as well as strong digital traffic. We are looking forward to the MTV Video Music Awards, which will air live on September 12 from Los Angeles.", "I also want to mention the rebranding of MTV Tr3s. Now known as Tr3s, MTV, Musica y Mas, we are expanding this brands content to appeal to a broader spectrum of the 12 to 34 Latino demographic, a growing force culturally and economically. Working more closely with MTV Networks International's Latin American operations, Tr3s will feature more original programming and key acquisitions, with particular emphasis on driving more co-viewing among teens and their parents. Again, a new expanding demographic category for us.", "In our International business, we are seeing solid progress in most of our major territories in Europe and in Latin America, as well as in India, and expect improvement in margins as we move forward. ", "Now I'll move on to Filmed Entertainment. Our theatrical slate at Paramount Pictures continues to perform very well this year. Our major releases in the past quarter were Marvel Studios' Iron Man 2 and DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After. Both franchises delivered solid box office performance, and we expect that to extend into strong DVD sales later this year. We are also pleased with our Nickelodeon tentpole, The Last Airbender. This film has defied critics' expectations and is still in the early stage of expanding overseas where it's performing well thus far.", "The home entertainment market continues to be soft. In addition to lower revenues from third-party distribution arrangements this past quarter, we had three fewer DVD releases than in the prior year. In June, Paramount Home Entertainment announced the extension of its revenue sharing license agreement with Redbox to continue to make its DVD and Blu-ray titles available for rent to the Redbox kiosks on the same day they are released for sale. The data from our 10-month test with Redbox suggested this arrangement had minimal impact on DVD sales and offered our consumers more choice on how they wish to enjoy our movies.", "Back in the theaters. Dinner for Schmucks just opened this past weekend and Middle Men opens tomorrow. Looking ahead, we have a number of promising films slated for release. Next month, we will be distributing Academy Award winner Davis Guggenheim's latest documentary, WAITING FOR \"SUPERMAN\", which focuses on the crisis and the current state of America's public schools. In the fall, you won't want to miss Jackass 3D and the highly anticipated sequel, Paranormal Activity 2. These will be followed by DreamWorks Animation's Megamind and Ethan and Joel Coen's remake of True Grit. ", "In conclusion, we are very pleased with the strong results we have delivered over the first half of the calendar year. We will continue to focus on driving and nurturing the enormous creativity that exists within our company and on improving our operational efficiencies. Our investment in original programming is clearly yielding positive results. We will continue to generate more and more new content for our audiences, and find more ways to monetize that content as digital, mobile and international forms of distribution become more significant. And we will also build on our financial strengths to ensure that we are well positioned to return money to our shareholders and capitalize on future opportunities. ", "And now I'll turn it over to my partner, Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thank you, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our results in more detail and update you on the key factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal 2010. I will also talk about our balance sheet, our leverage and our cash position. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations, which exclude from the June quarter of last year, $33 million of severance charges, $16 million at the Media Networks and $17 million at Filmed Entertainment.", "You may have noticed that adjusted operating income from our segments now excludes equity compensation in addition to any one-time items that affect comparability. This change in presentation should help you better analyze segment operating results.", "As a reminder, this year we are transitioning to a September fiscal year end. The trending schedules on our website should allow you to easily track the company's performance as we move through this transition. ", "Now let's take a look at our consolidated results. From a total company perspective, revenues were flat to last year at $3.3 billion. Media Networks revenues increased $125 million or 6%, primarily driven by higher affiliate fees and advertising revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 10% or $135 million. Home Entertainment revenues were lower in the quarter, reflecting fewer new releases and lower catalog sales. ", "Total company expenses declined $173 million or 6% for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment expenses declined by $212 million or 15%, and Media Network expenses increased $28 million or 2%. The decline at Filmed Entertainment was primarily due to lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases in the quarter. Consolidated operating income in the quarter increased 28% to $794 million.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Both domestic and international revenues increased 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a one percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a break down of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 4% in the June quarter, which was an improvement from the March quarter's 1% growth. International advertising increased 6% in the quarter, with foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by two percentage points. This growth was driven by strength in the European and Latin American markets.", "Turning to our affiliate revenues. Our domestic revenues increased 12%, while our international revenues increased 6%. Approximately 75% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate and subscriber increases.", "Moving to ancillary revenues. Domestic revenues declined 3%, while international revenues increased 7%. The decline in domestic ancillary revenues principally reflects lower Rock Band revenues, partially offset by increased online content licensing fees. The increase in international ancillary revenues was due to higher consumer product sales.", "Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $789 million in the quarter was 14% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 250 basis points to 38% in the June quarter, primarily due to lower Rock Band losses. If you exclude Rock Band, the core margin was 39%, which was an improvement of 20 basis points from last year. The improvement in the core margins was driven by higher affiliate, advertising and ancillary revenues, partially offset by higher programming expense.", "Programming expense in the quarter grew 10%. During the quarter, we aired licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond and Roseanne, new scripted series like the Hard Times of RJ Berger and Hot in Cleveland, as well as returning series and specials including America\u2019s Best Dance Crew and Hip Hop Honors.", "Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 10% to $1.2 billion. Page 10 of the web presentation provides a break down of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Our strategy of producing a smaller but more focused slate continues as we released fewer titles, both theatrically and in home entertainment, compared with the June quarter of last year.", "Worldwide theatrical revenues in the quarter increased $60 million or 10% to $644 million. Foreign currency had a three percentage point favorable impact on worldwide theatrical revenue growth. The performance in the quarter was driven by the distribution of Iron Man 2, Shrek Forever After and HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. This compares to last year's June 26 release of Transformers 2, as well as the release of Star Trek and Monsters vs. Aliens. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 43% to $248 million. The decline reflects lower revenues on distribution title, as well as fewer home entertainment releases.", "We released three titles in the quarter as compared to six titles in the June quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $69 million as compared to an operating loss of $8 million last year. The $77 million improvement in operating income principally reflects lower print, advertising and production costs as a result of fewer theatrical and home entertainment releases.", "During the quarter, certain Paramount releases from 2009 were made available to our Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, we recognized $40 million of revenue and $24 million of income at the Filmed Entertainment related to those releases. We also recorded $27 million of equity losses, so there was no net impact to Viacom.", "Moving below to segment results. Total company equity losses from investments were $24 million in the quarter. The losses principally relate to our investments in Epix and Rhapsody America. The tax rate in the quarter was 36%. ", "Now let's turn to our cash flow, our leverage and debt profile. We generated $355 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter as compared to $159 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income and lower working capital uses, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense and by higher pretax earnings.", "Our debt, for the most part, is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter.", "In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $677 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn. This facility expires in December, and we are in the process of renegotiating a new $1.5 billion facility to replace it. ", "Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9x, which is consistent with our target of approximately 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was 8x. ", "We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our leverage, managing our cost structure and improving our free cash flow conversion. Our enhanced credit profile has resulted in recent upgrades from both Fitch and S&P to a BBB+ rating, and Moody's has put our ratings on review for possible upgrade. ", "Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, last week, we announced another quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share that will bring our total dividends paid to shareholders to $182 million since we initiated our dividend program in June. And starting in the December quarter, we will begin buying back our stock under our $4 billion stock repurchase program.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the rest of our fiscal year. At Media Networks, we will continue to find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to enhance our core margins, while investing in programming. Our targeted annual growth rate for programming expenses remains mid-single digits.", "In the September quarter, however, the growth rate will be comparable to the June quarter due to the timing of shows coming on air. In September of 2009, Rock Band launched The Beatles game worldwide on Xbox, Wii and PLAYSTATION 3 platform. This year, they will launch Rock Band 3 worldwide on October 26, which falls in our next fiscal year. Rock Band will sell the software and song downloads related to Rock Band 3, while Mad Catz will be responsible for the hardware sales. ", "Year-to-date operating free cash flow of $737 million is $442 million higher than the same period in 2009. While we expect to generate substantial free cash flow this year, the increase will be somewhat mitigated in the September quarter, as last year, we benefited from the theatrical performance of Transformers 2. This year, we will be incurring production spend related to some of our fiscal year 2011 tentpole films, as well as increased participation payments.", "In summary, while the quarter was characterized by concerns about the macro environment, advertising showed continued strength, and we remain focused on executing our strategy. At Media Networks, the launch of new original programming and the return of several successful series are resonating with both viewers and advertisers. Our recently completed upfront demonstrates this momentum.", "At Filmed Entertainment, we continue to build our portfolio of franchise films, strengthening the pipeline for the studio. We are managing our cost structure and driving greater efficiencies throughout the organization with a focus on growing margin and increasing cash flow. Our commitment to reallocate capital in order to invest in key strategic initiatives positions us for long-term growth. ", "With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Imran Khan from JPMorgan.", "Imran Khan - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "First, I was wondering, you had a very strong upfront, how that position you -- how that translate into next year advertising growth in your mind? So if you can give us some color. I know you're not ready to give a guidance at this point. And secondly, you have been consistently improving your core margins. As we look forward, more of a high level, how should we think about -- where do you think your core margins can go?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, as you suggest, the upfront season really set us up well for the next fiscal year. The upfront sales will begin to be reflected in the December quarter, which will be our first fiscal quarter. Across the board as I mentioned in my remarks, we had pricing in the mid to high single digits increases. We had increase in volume, and the scatter market that we're experiencing now despite the turbulence in the overall economy or some of the headlines you see out there, the scatter market continues to be strong. Our pricing over the upfront in the last quarter, in the second quarter, was up mid-teens, and as we begin the third quarter, it is at that level or a little better than that level. So we continue to see strength. That gives us optimism for advertising growth in the next fiscal year. As far as our core margins, we work hard to not just maintain it but continue to improve it through efficiencies as Tom mentioned, while continuing to invest in programming. Obviously, as our revenues grow, as the advertising market continues to be strong, we know that our affiliate fee growth rate will continue to be strong. We may have an opportunity for further improvement.", "Thomas Dooley", "Imran, on the core margin front, as the Rock Band losses go from being losses and turn around into a profitability, which we foresee in the near future. We think that is a driver of core margins. We also see opportunities to expand the core margins in the International segment as we roll into next year. So we see continued momentum there, as well as we continue to find more operating efficiencies in all of the business segments. So we've been investing in programming, while at the same time driving those core margins, and we see the opportunity for that to continue. On the Filmed Entertainment side, we've done a lot to drive the cost equation there and improve that. Yet at the end of the day, the core margins there will be driven by the overall success of the film lineup.", "Operator", "Moving on to our next question from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Look, I was just curious, some peers have had some pretty terrific international advertising growth rates, 25% plus. I'm not sure you can summarize international easily, but can you square the difference to your 6% for us and are you more mature or making changes in your business? Is there any rating shares issues or is it potentially, we're going to see some improved results in international, as well as domestic. And then secondly for Tom, have you given any consideration to moving up your share repurchase program given the strength of your results and what appears to be a pretty attractive valuation?", "Thomas Dooley", "On the international side, we do see the opportunity for that to improve faster in the future. Once again, some of the markets, our market lineup doesn't exactly parallel their market lineup, and our demographic mix doesn't parallel their demographic mix. Certainly, there's been more strength in the older demographics relative to the younger demographic, and that's equal on the international and on the domestic side. We see strengthening in the younger demographic mix coming through. I guess, traditionally, I don't know if there's any stats on this, but it probably comes back later in a recovery period. So we do see international's advertising growth strengthening down the road. As far as the share repurchase program, we've been pretty disciplined about how we're going about doing that and be very mindful of the overall leverage of the company and the cash flow dynamics of the company. As you guys all know, the quarter ending December 31 is usually very strong from a cash flow point of view, and we will as we stated wait until that quarter, even though the stock is very attractively priced at this point.", "Philippe Dauman", "Only a couple of months away, Doug.", "Operator", "We'll move on to Spencer Wang from Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Philippe, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about your strategy to grow non-endemic advertising for some of your channels, where you are in that process and when you expect to see that re-accelerate ad revenue growth. And second, just for Tom. To clarify your programming costs growth comments mid-single digits, it looks like for fiscal 2010, the programming cost growth will be about 8% year-over-year. So is that what you mean by roughly mid-single digits, or should it be closer to 5% to 6%?", "Philippe Dauman", "On the first question, we're making a big push to grow non-endemic advertising in the Nickelodeon family of networks in particular and making great progress. We saw it in the upfront sales where as you know, the automotive category in general is back in advertising. We have a very low market share in that category. Many of the new car models coming out are geared to younger purchasers, young families. And we saw great progress in our upfront sales in that category. We see also a lot of progress in electronic products and a lot of new products out there, insurance, as well as advertiser like Procter & Gamble and the like. So we start to see a lot more progress going forward, but we are already seeing good signs of that in the upfront season that we just completed, as well as on the scatter. Tom?", "Thomas Dooley", "On the mid-single digits we're referring like 5% or 6% but depending upon which shows are working, which shows aren't working in the third quarter. We may mix it up but it won't get any higher than the 7% or 8% range in any case.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "Tom, on the equity line, maybe you could just refresh us on when you expect Epix to be cash flow breakeven and profitable? That $26 million in below the line from Epix and Rhapsody, how should the losses there progress in terms of the recoup?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, the equity losses on Epix will continue from a P&L point of view. They'll be cash flow breakeven, we expect to be pretty close to that in the December ending quarter, the first quarter of our new fiscal year. So we're in pretty good shape from a cash flow point of view we believe on Epix, and I'm very excited about that. As far as the other categories, the number that we reported this quarter will pretty much round out to be the number we report. There's pluses and minuses. We have profits coming in from our India venture that are offsetting some of the losses that are coming from some of our other ventures around the world. But that rate or aggregate number seems to be a number that you can roll forward with for a period of time.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "And then, Philippe, when you look at the nature of some of your MTV brands, whether it's -- not just Jersey Shore but Teen Mom or 16 and Pregnant, I mean, these things are controversial. Some of these topics are controversial. I know that works to your advantage in terms of your TV ratings. I'm just wondering in terms of the financials, how does that work in terms of your advertisers? What are your advertisers saying about some of these topics? And I know at times, it's a tough balancing act. It must be. How do you approach that balance?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, actually there was some issues when Jersey Shore's first season launched. A lot of talk out there about, before the show really hit, and now we have advertisers that are scrambling to get on it. We have some advertisers who want to get wall-to-wall on particular episodes. We're turning them away. So it's resonating culturally, and with our audiences and of course, marketers want to reach those hard to reach passionate audiences. Same with Teen Mom, which is actually a very sweet show if you've watched it. There's a lot of life lessons in it and very uplifting. So those shows are actually doing very, very well from a marketing standpoint.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "Philippe started out asking about -- mentioning that the Film business'  home video line was continuing to weaken or be weak year-over-year. Just wondering, given everyone seems to be shrinking their film slates and shrinking the number of releases, have you thought about or would you have interest in doing more of what you used to do in terms of a joint ventures overseas both on the theatrical side, as well as on the home video side? And just how you think about getting the cost structure at the Film business to a better place?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, Rich, we are continuously looking at ways to reduce the cost structure and overhead of our business, and make continuous improvement in that respect, including in the home entertainment line. As far as international distribution, we continue to have joint ventures in several territories. We look at that again as the marketplace evolves. The international marketplace is growing. In some markets, it makes sense for us to have our own distribution. In others, we will look at opportunities for joint ventures either with local players or some of our colleagues such as Universal, with whom we already have ventures in certain territories. So we continue to look at that equation and are looking to improve our cost structure at the studio.", "Thomas Dooley", "Rich, just a follow-up on that. The point about the Movie business continuing to contract the number of films they release, we see that actually changing. We see that beginning to change in the end of  the second quarter, certainly as we go into the third quarter. I'd say the first and second quarter of this year will be sort of the bottoming out point of the downward contraction in major releases, which draw a lot of advertising, put a lot of advertising in the marketplace, and we think that bodes well for us as we move forward.", "Philippe Dauman", "One of the factors in that, not just the major studios but you have studios such as DreamWorks and other mini majors, who were coming out with new slates. Having not put them out before or increase slates as we look forward beginning next year.", "Thomas Dooley", "So movies that will put advertising into the marketplace. The volume there, we'll actually start to see a bit of an uptick, which is the first time that's happened in a while.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from James Dix from Wedbush.", "James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "First, I guess for Tom. Looking at maybe in networks and the non-programming expenses, how should we be thinking about growth there? What are the puts and takes in terms of holding that down? How much further inefficiencies can you get because you've obviously taken a fair amount of cost out of the business already. And then secondly, just on your deal with Redbox, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the data that you've obviously seen in terms of the impact of your window on DVD sales and data, which some of your peers have talked about, indicating that they do see some benefit to a longer window on their DVD sales. Is there anything to reconcile there? Or is there any comment you could offer on that or the data that you have?", "Philippe Dauman", "This is Philippe. I'll take the Redbox question and turn over the expense question to Tom. As far as Redbox, unlike some of our competitors who were in litigation with Redbox, we had an agreement that gave us actual data over a 10-month period. So we had objective information. That data showed us that there was extremely little degradation in DVD sales, and the financial terms offered by Redbox for an earlier window far outweighed the degradation. Our competitors who have the 28-day window are getting much lower pricing in their Redbox deals. So thanks to our actually having real world data, unlike our competitors, we were able to make what we think is the best decision for us.", "Thomas Dooley", "On the cost side of the Media Networks, the business, we will be increasing the compensation line, which we held pretty tight last year. That will be a factor that will drive increases in costs. We're also looking at ways to expand some of our promotional dollars, what we used to promote shows, and that will be tied to the overall efficiency that we get from promoting those shows. So that will basically translate into higher revenue growth. So I think we will continue -- we've got some pretty good models in place to really be able to release dollars and spend as it relates to the overall revenue equation on the other side of it. And we've been very successful at driving more investment in higher margin dollars, which is improving our bottom line, and that's the focus that we've had across the company.", "Operator", "Moving along, we'll take our next question from Tuna Amobi from Standard & Poor's Equity Group.", "Tuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "So with regard to Rock Band, it seems like the strategic shift that you implemented recently is actually starting to stem the losses there. If you can provide a little bit more color on when you think Rock Band might actually attain profitability and any further changes along those lines that you're making. And separately, still within the gaming theme, I noticed that you've started to make even more concerted push into social gaming, Social Express, et cetera, and I think some time a couple of years ago, you had Flux as well. So obviously, casual gaming is one of your strong suits. So I wanted to get a sense in terms of gaming as a category? Any idea as to how much that business could grow? What's your longer-term strategy to kind of synthesize all of these platforms perhaps into one coordinated and centralized platform? So any color on your gaming strategy would be helpful and any quantification as well, just to get a sense of how much of your overall growth that might contribute over time?", "Thomas Dooley", "Let me turn a little bit back to metrics behind Rock Band and Philippe will talk more about the overall gaming strategy. Rock Band, we have put in place the deal with Mad Catz, the distributor that will distribute the hardware peripherals associated with the game unit. That substantially reduces or effectively eliminate the economic risk associated with that, which had been a drag on our previous earnings potential associated with the entity. The second piece of the equation deals with the deal we recently did with Microsoft around a dance game for the new Connect product that they have out there. We have great hopes and expectations for that, but the way we structured that deal, we believe we have little downside risk and all upside risk associated with that. As we roll forward here, Rock Band 3 will be distributed in the marketplace. We think it's got great potential, we'll be very cautious on inventory levels that we put into stores. So we have the ability to realize profits finally on this segment, and we're very excited about that and very optimistic about it.", "Philippe Dauman", "And really the Rock Band strategy, it's really been reducing the risk. So going forward, we don't have the risk that we experienced in the past and hoping for better rewards. As far as our overall gaming strategy, we are very excited at pushing our strong position in the casual gaming arena. We have great reach. We are now beginning a number of initiatives that will lead to subscription revenues for us, that will enhance virtual good sales. We think there's a lot of opportunity in the mobile platforms, as we go forward around the world. And incidentally, we're experiencing some good success in many of our international markets in this domain. And the Social Express acquisition, which you pointed out, it's very, very low cost. It's in keeping with our strategy as it relates to acquisitions, driving our business, very low cost really, helping our organic growth accelerating the development of social gaming, not the larger approach that you've been reading about in this arena. So we think we can drive revenues and have a good growth curve in that business.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Alan Gould, Evercore Partners.", "Alan Gould - Natexis Bleichroeder, Inc.", "First, when I look forward to the September quarter advertising. If we look at it, how much is that going to be impacted by the weak upfront from last year? It sounds like the June -- if I remember correctly, the upfront last year, you sold, what, low 40s percent of your inventory, down about 8%, and that's probably what drove the June quarter to have lower ad growth than the rest of the industry. Is the September quarter going to face that? And secondly, Philippe, I was wondering, if you could update us on the status of the YouTube litigation. Is that now over with, or is that going to be a continuing item?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, well, the September quarter is the last quarter that we'll have last year's weak upfront that we have to overcome. So that certainly is a factor in the September quarter. However, as I mentioned in my remarks, because of the continued strength in the scatter market and good ratings in our core networks, we expect to see sequential improvement in the rate of growth from the 4% that we delivered in the second quarter. As far as the YouTube litigation, we intend to pursue an appeal at the Second Circuit. The decision of the lower court allowed us to deal with the legal issues on an expedited basis without having to go through a protracted trial and the expense of a trial. So we look forward to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to deal with this issue and the ruling, which was by the way inconsistent with rulings that have been made by other courts around the country.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll take our next question from Matthew Harrigan, Wunderlich Securities.", "Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Can you talk about how you think internally on a long-term basis about the ratio of home entertainment revenues to rentals? I mean, not just DVDs and even Redbox, I mean, a broadband over time. And really coupling international, as well as domestic. I mean, obviously, that ratios gotten blown out of the water, the last couple of years. Do you see that stabilizing? Or do you think that, that hits a slight inflection point when we got some growth in a few years as technology evolves and consumption patterns evolve?", "Philippe Dauman", "Matt, that's right, the entire part of your question. But as far as the sales versus rentals, certainly, you are seeing rentals shifting from the box environment to the Redbox and other platforms. Rentals are increasing. Blu-Ray distribution is starting to pick up again as the consumer markets improve in certain markets, and that's an opportunity to drive greater margin product as we go forward. There has been some stabilization in DVD sales as far as new releases, but continued weakness in catalog DVD sales, and we see that continuing. The international arena continues to be a good opportunity as we see the revenues increasing in theatrical. It's also driving sales of DVD. So international is an opportunity for the studios.", "Matthew Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc.", "Mor on the frame of home entertainment sales to your box office receipts, not the sales versus rental.", "Philippe Dauman", "The conversion rates sure have stabilized on new releases.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Tom, can you just remind us as we look out to the rest of this year, I think, Nickelodeon has a sizable amount of licensing revenue that comes in seasonally with calendar Q4, although you may book that on a sell-in basis. So I was wondering if you could just talk about what you're hearing from retailers and what the year-on-year compare looks like? I think, the last couple of years, obviously, the consumer has been on a tough spot. So are the comps sort of favorable this year, and how we should be thinking about that piece of the business moving into the back half?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, we see great interest from the retailers this year in terms of both the volume and breadth of product that they'd like to carry in the stores as it relates to the CP that we have available, and we hope that will be a big piece of our new fiscal first quarter and look forward to it. We are seeing some good order volumes there, as I said, around some of the great traditional products that we have available for them, and that's product both on existing franchises and some new franchises that we've introduced. We don't get that granular on any specific dollars and cents associated with that, but we do see that as a category that will drive growth in the Nickelodeon.", "Philippe Dauman", "And it's the 10th anniversary of Dora the Explorer, so a big celebration you can see in the marketplace.", "Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "I don't know if you have considered selling Epix or Epix content through Netflix, sort of similar to what Starz is doing. I know that Epix is looking at different sort of distribution models than the traditional pay network, but I wanted to just bounce that idea off you, Philippe, and hear your thoughts.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, Epix does well. It's doing well now we're in the marketplace with several distributors we've reached agreements with earlier. We are looking at all forms of distribution going forward, and Epix will be announcing a new distribution agreement pretty shortly.", "Operator", "We'll take our next version from David Bank, RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "I guess first question is, you've given us a sense, I guess, that the buyback is going to take place kind of proportionately with your seasonal cash flow generation. But can you give us a sense like over what time period we should expect the authorization to be used over? And then two quick ones. The second is, Philippe, could you give us a sense of the magnitude of the acceleration or kind of how you're currently pacing or some more color? And then lastly, I just want to make sure I got what Tom said. On the equity line, are the Epix equity losses going to be consistent with the last couple of quarters, or were you talking about the other businesses in there like the India investment and stuff?", "Thomas Dooley", "Well, the Epix equity losses will go down as Epix moves closer to breakeven throughout the end of this year and into next year, 2011. So there will be other items in there, whereas, we make different investments in some of the smaller entities or 50% joint ventures or less joint ventures that we have ownership interest in and that will keep that line pacing around that level.", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the buyback goes, we expect to initiate it again in the next quarter. We expect to execute it on a steady basis, looking at what our cash needs are and being consistent with our leverage ratio objectives at the approximate 2x leverage ratio. But we think based on our cash generation and our capital needs that this will be a significant pace as we go forward. And what is your question on acceleration?", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Order of magnitude, so a little bit more color around the improvement you're seeing sequentially.", "Philippe Dauman", "In advertising sales?", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Yes, domestically.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, basically we're still, as I indicated in a response to an earlier question, we're still dealing with last year's upfront, and that's being made up and then some by a good scatter market. And once we get into October and into December quarter, we will benefit from this upfront, where we have some greater volume than last year at higher pricing, and we see no reason why the scatter market shouldn't continue to be strong, and we'll able to ride the solid ratings we have at our key networks. And our objective, of course, is to try to keep that sequential growth going.", "Thomas Dooley", "It's important to note that our older skewing networks like the TV Land, the Nick at Nite and then to some extent, CMT, are very high demand networks and are pacing at great growth rates as we've talked about. The majority of our demo that we have to sell are in the younger skewing demographics, and those have recovered at a slower rate than the older skewing demos. We are seeing an acceleration in the advertisers, who are advertising to the younger demos. And we think that, combined with the new upfront that we just completed will help us launch our advertising revenues and accelerate the growth there.", "James Bombassei", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Viacom Earnings Release Teleconference for the Quarter and Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2010. Today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead.", "Jim Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30th. Joining me for today\u2019s discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our CFO.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. Let me refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.", "Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Thanks a lot, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We are indeed more than pleased to share our results with you this morning from our outstanding September quarter performance, which capped off an even more impressive fiscal 2010.", "Our business is strong. Our growth firepower continues to grow. There is no question that we have the focus to continue to excel and most importantly, the management expertise to deliver quarter-after-quarter and to deliver year-after-year.", "As we told you, throughout the difficult period we all experienced over the past 18 months or so, the Viacom team led by Philippe has been taking all the steps necessary to position us continuously for the eventual economic recovery.", "And today, we are seeing the economy beginning to turn and Viacom with its industry-leading global entertainment brand, continues to capitalize on the new opportunities that are emerging, particularly those that the evolution in technology provide, whether it\u2019s new windowing opportunities, our 3D technologies or even new screens, there has never, never been a better time to be in the content and there is no better global content creator than Viacom.", "Our continued investment in programs is giving a success of array and our cable networks are enjoying, it is also what has set our motion picture studio back on its great foundations, with a really rich pipeline of projects based on franchises and brands.", "This operational success is a direct result of our dedication to creating the best content and delivering it to (inaudible) everywhere on the planet. For decades, I have consistently said that content is king and content is king.", "This has been our legacy that will grow our future, indeed as we\u2019ve seen the digital addition pathways emerge and in turn create promising ancillary revenue streams, the promising in this declaration takes on even new meaning and importance. This will benefit not only our audiences but indeed our shareholders as well.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to my very close friend, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased you could join us. Today, we reported our results for both the quarter and the fiscal year, which in the case of 2010 comprises nine months. We chalked up an impressive list of achievements in 2010.", "The headlines include accelerating the creative engines across the company to forge even stronger connections with our audiences, attracting more viewers on television, online and on the movie screen.", "We improved our ad sales results, boosting our revenue growth rate for three consecutive quarters, continued to build and strengthen our affiliate partnerships, which are delivering double-digit revenue growth, achieved innovative distribution for our joint venture EPIX to make it profitable within one year of launch and creating significant asset value.", "And we maintained our focus on operating efficiently and generating strong free cash flow, returning value to our shareholders with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the resumption of our share buyback program.", "As the world around us continues to revolve with new technologies transforming how people experience entertainment in their daily lives, it is our relentless focus on our audiences, understanding them and respecting their entertainment choices, our singular focus on creating great content and our disciplined operational and financial strategy, these are the factors that will continue to fuel our success. From our vantage point, the economy is improving, with the noise of the election season behind us. I believe that by a disruptive event the pace of economic recovery will accelerate.", "Today, I will briefly review our financial results and spend a little more time talking about the highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide additional detail on our performance and then we will be happy to take your questions. As we discuss our results this morning, we will speak to the adjusted numbers.", "Let me begin with our announcement this morning that we plan to sell Harmonix. As a result, we have reclassified Harmonix to a discontinued operation. Our decision to exit this business reflects our strategy of focusing entirely on what we do best, make great branded entertainment content and deliver it through a variety of platforms.", "Harmonix has and will continue to create terrific video games, but for us, it is about focus. The console games business requires an expertise and scale that we don\u2019t have, so we have taken steps to sell Harmonix and we are in discussions with several potential buyers.", "Now let\u2019s review our numbers. Consolidated revenues grew 5% to $3.3 billion in the September quarter with Media Networks up 8% and Filmed Entertainment revenues up modestly. Our fiscal 2010 revenues were up slightly, as a 7% gain in Media Networks revenues was partially offset by a decline in Filmed Entertainment, primarily due to substantially fewer home entertainment releases.", "Viacom\u2019s net earnings from continuing operations grew 7% to $461 million in the September quarter and diluted earnings per share were $0.75, up 6% over the prior year.", "For fiscal 2010, net earnings from continuing operations rose 20% to $1.15 billion and diluted EPS for the nine-month period were $1.88, also a 20% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow exceeded $1 billion for the nine-month fiscal 2010.", "Now let\u2019s move to our Media Networks. Overall, we are very pleased with our cable networks are performing. Our largest brands without a doubt are driving the pop culture dialogue. Right now, we have the most talked about, blogged about and tweeted about shows, artists, personalities and cultural phenomena.", "Our networks are home to the number one series on television with 12 to 34 year olds, the number one basic cable sitcom of the year, the number one cable network in total day with kids and total viewers, the top two animated programs of the year with kids and the number one late-night talk show among adults 18 to 34, whose host was voted the most influential man of 2010.", "In the domestic digital space, we have the top online destinations in the music, humor and kids categories. We are the destination of choice to reach and connect with our highly coveted audiences. Even the President of the United States chose BET, CMT and MTV when he wanted to speak directly with young voters. Not a surprise, since our networks have nearly 30% of all 12 to 34-year-old viewing on ad-supported cable.", "And marketers of toys, movies, beverages and new technologies, just to name a few consider our brands the place to be to advertise their product. That strength is reflected in the upward trajectory of our ad revenues.", "Our domestic ad revenues grew 8% in the September quarter, 4 percentage points higher than the 4% gain we delivered during the June quarter. This improvement was driven by strong growth in the scatter market, up in the mid 20s on a percentage basis. We believe this momentum will continue.", "Starting October 1, we began to operate another the more favorable results of our 2010 upfront sales and quarter-to-date, the scatter market strength is continuing. This gives me confidence that we will generate another quarter of sequential improvement in our ad sales growth rate.", "We are also continuing to find new ways to bring greater value to our advertisers, expanding the relationships we have and to even more comprehensive marketing partnerships. For example, we recently unleashed a new creative team called MTV Scratch. It is designed to leverage all of our research insights and creative assets to offer our marketing partners new strategies and business models to strengthen or even launch their own brands and products.", "The creative products that result could appear on a single targeted network or across Viacom\u2019s portfolio of brands. This type of collaborative endeavor becomes all the more valuable in an increasingly complex and disaggregated environment.", "For both the quarter and full fiscal 2010, our worldwide affiliate partnerships generated double-digit revenue growth and our share of the market continues to expand. In the September quarter, our family of networks continued to hold the largest share of cable viewing, in fact our share was larger than that of Scripps, Discovery and A&E combined.", "In addition to bringing certain international channels to our U.S. audiences, we are continuing to partner with our affiliates on a number of new products and technologies. With consumers looking for more video on demand, we are increasing the content available for both next-day VOD, as well as identifying the right programming for transactional VOD opportunities.", "In the area of 3D technology, we are exploring select opportunities to offer 3D programming in the areas of musical performances, specific sporting events and certain kids programming, and we are also developing interactive applications for TV with a couple of partners.", "All this interest reflects the fact that our core cable networks are on a hot street. There is rarely a conversation about pop culture that doesn\u2019t allude to at least one of our major properties. This is the result of brilliant creative work and our continuous investment in programming content.", "Today, I\u2019m just going to hit the highlights of what we\u2019ve accomplished and importantly, address why we believe this success will continue. The big story for the September quarter was the continued surge at MTV, the momentum that started late in 2009 reached a new high this quarter with our audience up 28% over the prior year. This was led by the number one series across all broadcast and cable for 12 to 34 year olds and the highest rated series in MTV history, Jersey Shore. But it is not just first-pumping that is boosting the ratings.", "MTV had four of the top 15 original cable series of the summer, Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, The Hills and Real World: New Orleans. And the network had 11 series and specials that each averaged a 1.0 or higher rating for the first gearing of each episode during the quarter.", "In addition, MTV hosted its most successful Video Music Awards in eight years, drawing well over 11 million viewers to the 2010 VMAs and generating the highest level of ad sales for this tentpole ever and we are building on this success.", "MTV\u2019s new series, World of Jenks, debuted immediately following the VMAs and was seen by nearly 5 million viewers. Now it\u2019s settled into its regular time slot \u2013 now that has settled into its regular time slot, the show\u2019s ratings continue to be strong and another season of 16 and Pregnant has also returned to the MTV lineup.", "Looking ahead, we will launch the next season of The Hard Times of RJ Berger, which grew consistently throughout its freshman season, as well as My Life As Liz, and we are also looking forward to more scripted programming with Skins and Teen Wolf.", "COMEDY CENTRAL delivered another one for the record books with the highest-rated and most-watched third quarter in its history, expanding its audience by 15% year-over-year. A key driver of this success was its original programming.", "The Daily Show and The Colbert Report both delivered bigger audiences and the influence that these two shows and their brilliant principles have on the national discourse is exemplified by the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or FEAR cannot be overstated.", "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report were the number one and number two ranked late-night talk shows among adults 18 to 34 in October ahead of Late Night with David Letterman and the Tonight Show.", "The second season of Tosh.0, which is a product of our standup pipeline was a born with hit, nearly doubling the size of his audience over the first season. And Futurama has nurtured a loyal following, with an average of more than 2.6 million viewers tuning in to each episode. Building on this success, we\u2019ve already brought back South Park and the Ugly Americans this quarter and premiered Nick Swardson\u2019s Pretend Time.", "At Nickelodeon, consistency rate and by that, I mean the consistent rate at which they continue to top themselves. Nick delivered its biggest quarter third quarter audience ever among total viewers and was the top cable network in total day with kids two to 11 and total viewers. All of its shows had outstanding results.", "In particular our growing franchises of iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush are continuing to build even bigger tween and teen audiences, and that attraction extends beyond their respective television series. Just last month, Big Time Rush\u2019s debut album was number three in the country.", "Nickelodeon is the well-established leader in children\u2019s television and as others enter or attempt to expand in this market, they will find that Nick thrives on the competition. It is continuing to build on its number one portfolio of programming very strategically and selectively.", "We recently announced two new deals that will further enrich the brands Nickelodeon has to offer to its audiences. Nick has acquired the U.S. TV and merchandising rights to the Winx Club, which debuted in Italy and quickly grew into an international franchise.", "It also acquired the pay-TV and merchandising rights for Latin America, Canada, the U.K. and several other countries. We\u2019ll work with our partner to co-develop and co-produce the next two seasons of this animated fantasy series about the Adventures of Six Fairies that is usually -- which is usually popular with young girls.", "Nickelodeon has also entered into a partnership to develop and produce a new animated pre-school series based on the characters created by Beatrix Potter. This is another well-established brand that continues to be cherished by young children around the world.", "As you look across all of our other networks, we have a number of standouts and bright spots and we have some that we are working hard to turn around. That underscores the importance of continuing to invest in our programming so we can find the right mix that resonates with our audience.", "In our international markets, we continue to nurture and grow our brands and we\u2019ve seen solid growth in our audiences in most of our major markets. While our networks are programmed locally to ensure they reflect the unique interests of each market, we are enjoying increasing success across global markets with many of our U.S. franchises, such as Jersey Shore, Hard Times of RJ Berger, iCarly, Victorious and more.", "We are also developing very successful telenovelas that resonate across regional borders. And our major music tentpoles, including the European Music Awards, World Stage and Push, allow us to maximize our content across the globe. Over the next few years, we will intensify our focus on growing the topline, bottom line and margins of our international business.", "Turning now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount Pictures continued to refine its business operations, resulting in a $94 million profit improvement for fiscal 2010. The studio\u2019s film slate performed quite well this year. In the first nine month of the calendar year, we distributed five of the top 15 highest gross movies in the U.S., which pushed Paramount to the number two spot in domestic box office.", "Right now, we\u2019re enjoying the terrific success of Jackass 3D, which has already grossed over $110 million domestically and Paranormal Activity 2 that set a record for the top opening gross for a horror film ever.", "This past weekend, DreamWorks Animation\u2019s Megamind had a great start, bringing in more than $46 million as the number one film and Morning Glory opened in theaters yesterday. These films are a great start to our fiscal year 2011 slate. Running out the remainder of this quarter domestically is The Fighter, which is a third-party distribution deal and Ethan and Joel Coen\u2019s remake of True Grit.", "Our home entertainment revenues in both the recent quarter and the fiscal year reflect significantly fewer releases than in the comparable periods in the prior year. We had only five home entertainment releases in our fiscal 2010 versus 12 in the first nine months of 2009. That along with continued softness in the overall market weighed on our results.", "Before I conclude, I want to make a couple of comments about the innovative deal our joint venture, EPIX made with Netflix. This deal represents an inflection point. It was the first time that a nontraditional distributor valued content, in this case for a new segment of the pay window, at a level that is comparable to, indeed higher than the rates traditional distributors pay.", "Windowing content has always equipped consumers with a variety of price points for how and when they want to consume content. This new segment of the pay window provides yet another option for consumers. It is an incremental opportunity for us to monetize our content and it clearly demonstrates that Netflix is going to innovate to meet the evolving demands of their customers.", "This new partnership set EPIX on a clear path to profitability, which it will have this quarter and has done so in record time. We expect to continue to add incremental digital dollars not dimes for our entire Viacom business in the future.", "To conclude, fiscal 2010 have set the foundation for what looks to be a very happy Viacom new year. Our focus on building our content and brands across the company is fueling renewed momentum across distribution channels, geographies and technologies.", "We continue to allocate capital judiciously to operate our businesses with increasing efficiency so that we can grow our businesses dynamically while returning substantial capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.", "I will now turn it over to our CFO, Jimmy Barge.", "Jimmy Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019ve all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. As a reminder, September is the end of our new fiscal year. Accordingly for 2010 we will be filing a 10-K for the nine-month sub-period ended September 30th. We will file our 10-K with the SEC tomorrow morning, since today is a government holiday. However, we will be making it available on our website shortly.", "This morning, I\u2019m going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Given our decision to proceed with the sale of Harmonix, Rock Band has been reclassified as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. Therefore, our total company continuing operations and Media Networks\u2019 adjusted results exclude Rock Band.", "Adjusted results also excluded from the September quarter of this year $27 million in tax benefits, principally related to the disposition of certain assets. Last year\u2019s adjusted results also exclude the $52 million after-tax loss associated with the tender for our 5.75% senior notes, as well as $74 million in discrete tax benefits.", "Please note that during the quarter, we took an impairment charge of $230 million on Harmonix\u2019s goodwill and a $30 million pre-tax write-down of Rock Band assets, both of which are included in discontinued operations.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 8% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 7% and international revenues increased 8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.", "Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 8% in the September quarter. International advertising increased 2% in the quarter with foreign exchange reducing the growth rates by 6 percentage points. The international growth in the quarter was driven by strength in Europe, Latin America and Asia.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 12%, while international revenues declined 1%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points. Approximately 80% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases, with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange growth for the quarter was driven primarily by rate increases.", "Now moving to ancillary revenues, worldwide ancillary revenues increased 1% in the quarter, principally driven by higher international program sales. Media Networks\u2019 adjusted operating income of $873 million in the quarter was 9% higher than last year. The operating margin improved 40 basis points to 41%. The improvement in margin was driven by higher advertising and affiliate revenues, partially offset by higher programming and SG&A expense.", "Programming expense in the quarter increased 8%. During the quarter, we had licensed programming such as Everybody Loves Raymond, new series like World of Jenks and If You Really Knew Me, as well as returning series, including Jersey Shore, Teen Mom and Tosh.0.", "SG&A expense increased 10% in the quarter, which is above our normal growth rate. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation as a result of the timing of our year end accrual and our improved operating performance, including higher advertising sales.", "Turning to the nine-month results, Media Networks\u2019 revenue increased 7% to $6.1 billion and adjusted operating income was up 9% to $2.4 billion. The operating income margin of 39.5% for the period represents an improvement of 60 basis points.", "Now turning to Filmed Entertainment, revenues in the quarter increased 1% to $1.2 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 3% to $372 million, driven by the current quarter\u2019s theatrical release of The Last Airbender and Dinner For Schmucks, as well as the international performance of Shrek Forever After.", "Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 13% to $406 million. The decline reflects fewer home entertainment releases, as we released one title in the current quarter as compared to five titles in the September quarter of last year. TV license fees increased 18% to $372 million. The increase in TV license fees for the quarter was due to higher syndication revenue.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $52 million in the quarter, which was $21 million lower than last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison with the prior year\u2019s performance of Transformers 2. As a reminder, Transformers 2 was released on June 26th and the related P&A costs for the film were largely expensed in last year\u2019s June quarter.", "During the quarter, certain Paramount releases were made available to our EPIX pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, Filmed Entertainment recognized $31 million of revenue and $20 million of income in the quarter. Also in the quarter, we recorded $16 million of equity losses related to EPIX.", "Turning to the nine-month performance period, Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 9% to $3.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $38 million, which compares to a loss of $56 million in the prior year.", "As a reminder, the nine-month results exclude the December quarter, which for the studio is typically a strong quarter from a profitability standpoint as we benefit from the release of our summer tentpole film on DVD.", "Now touching on corporate, expenses increased $8 million in the quarter, primarily related to the timing of our year-end incentive compensation accrual.", "Moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $15 million in the quarter. Losses principally relate to our investments in EPIX and Rhapsody America, partially offset by profits at our Viacom 18 India TV venture.", "Other items reflected income of $5 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $13 million last year. The income in the quarter primarily reflects foreign exchange gains, while last year\u2019s results reflected foreign exchange losses. Reported tax rate in the quarter was 32%. This rate was favorably impacted by $27 million of discrete tax benefits, excluding the discrete tax benefit, the 2010 effective tax rate was 36%.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Dooley", "Thanks Jimmy. Today, I\u2019m going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile, our return on invested capital and our return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about seasonal factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year.", "But first, I\u2019d like to touch on our trailing 12 month results as we transition to our new fiscal year. Essentially, I\u2019m taking the nine-month transition year in 2010 and adding to it the December quarter of 2009. The detail of this information can be found on our trending schedules on our website.", "So, for the 12 months ended September 30th, Media Networks\u2019 revenue grew 5% to $8.3 billion and adjusted operating income increased 7% to $3.4 billion. Media Networks\u2019 margins increased 40 basis points to 41%.", "Filmed Entertainment revenues declined 6% to $5.2 billion and the studio generated adjusted operating income of $340 million. This translates to an operating income margin for the studio of 6.6%.", "On a total company basis for the 12 months period revenue increased 1% and adjusted operating income increased 17%. We generated earnings per share of $3.02, which was a 26% increase from the prior year and we produced $2.1 billion of operating free cash flow.", "Now let\u2019s move to free cash flow for the quarter ended September 2010. We generated $311 million in operating free cash flow in the September quarter compared to $691 million last year. Page six of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.", "The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher cash tax payments and higher working capital uses. The increase in cash taxes was driven by the higher pre-tax earnings and the some setting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. The higher working capital use was due to production spending related to some of our future tentpole releases, as well as increased participation payments for distribution titles.", "Production spending in the quarter was driven by our fiscal 2011 and 2012 releases, including Transformers 3, Mission Impossible 4 and the Adventures of Tintin. Increased participation payments reflect a number of films and the timing of payments on our distribution titles.", "Shrek Forever After and Iron Man 2 largely accounted for the payments in the current quarter, while last year, there was no more release and participations for the 2009 release Monsters Vs. Aliens were paid in the June quarter.", "As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowing. We are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at the end of the quarter. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $837 million of cash and cash equivalents. At September 30th, our $3.25 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "At the beginning of October, we terminated our previous credit facility and entered into a new $2 billion revolving credit facility. The reduction in size reflects our reduced borrowing needs and lower leverage. The terms of the new facility reflect the strength of our balance sheet.", "Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.9 times, which is consistent with our target of approximately two times. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four fiscal quarters be at least three times. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was over eight times.", "Regarding our commitment to return capital to shareholders, on October 1st we paid our second quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. On October 1st, we also commenced purchases under our $4 billion stock repurchase program. To date, we have purchased $162 million worth of stock and we are on pace to purchase approximately $400 million for the December quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to talk about some of the factors impacting the 2011 fiscal year. We achieved mid to high single-digit percentage increases in pricing in the new upfront at our Media Networks. This strong upfront base, combined with our ratings and a robust scatter market will result in another quarter of improvement in our domestic ad sales growth rate.", "At Media Networks, our targeted annual growth rate for fiscal 2011 programming expense remains mid single digits. However, due to the timing of new shows coming on air, this growth rate will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We will find cost efficiencies that will enable us to continue to enhance our margins as we invest in our programming.", "In the December quarter of last year, Filmed Entertainment benefited from the Home Video release of franchise titles Transformers 2, Star Trek and G.I. Joe. In the December quarter of this year, we will benefit from the $115 million minimum guarantee related to the amended Marvel distribution agreement.", "However, we will face a difficult comparison in Home Video and we will have approximately $200 million in incremental P&A costs as a result of an increase in the number of theatrical releases, including DreamWorks Animation\u2019s Megamind, with no comparable release in the prior year. Therefore, the studio will face difficult bottom line comparisons on a year-to-year basis.", "As Philippe mentioned, Paramount is off to a great start with the successful and highly profitable release of Jackass 3D and Paranormal Activity 2. During the fiscal year, we will be releasing a new animated franchise picture under the Nickelodeon film label called Rango and we will be distributing Marvel\u2019s Thor and Captain America, as well as DreamWorks Animation\u2019s Kung Fu Panda 2.", "In June Paramount releases the J.J. Abrams-directed Super 8, and on July 1st, they release Transformers 3 worldwide in 3D. In terms of Transformers 3, significant P&A costs for the film will be incurred in the June quarter, so from a revenue and more importantly profitability standpoint, the studio\u2019s September quarter will benefit.", "EPIX\u2019s recent deal with Netflix, as well as other distribution deals will enable the joint venture to achieve profitability in fiscal 2011. Accordingly, this improvement in their bottom line results will be reflected in our equity earnings. 2011, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 37%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the fluctuations in the domestic versus international profitability mix.", "In terms of cash taxes, we anticipate that they will be comparable to the book taxes given the 2010 some setting of accelerated deductions related to domestic film and television production expense. We will continue to target a leverage ratio of two times. As we progress through 2011 and our earnings grow, we will consider additional debt in order to maintain the two times leverage ratio.", "In summary, at Viacom, we remain focused on executing against our core business, challenging ourselves to enhance our organic growth prospects and improve our returns on invested capital. We have set clear goals and have executed against them.", "From a Media Networks perspective, we have reinvigorated the ratings on several of our flagship brands, we have secured long-term growth in our affiliation agreements and we have implemented and sustained rigorous cost containment initiatives in order to enhance our core margins.", "At Filmed Entertainment, as we look beyond fiscal 2011, we have a number of franchise films that we are very excited about, including Star Trek 2, G.I. Joe 2, the first film to be launched from the recently acquired Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, as well as sequels to the Jack Ryan Series and ZOOLANDER.", "In both our EPIX pay-TV and Viacom 18 India TV joint ventures have transitioned from the investment stage to successful and profitable operations that create asset value for our company. We have strengthened our balance sheet, enhanced our debt profile and we will continue to focus on driving our bottom line results, maximizing our free cash flow, increasing our return on invested capital and returning capital to our shareholders.", "With that, I want to thank you for listening and now we\u2019ll turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Nomura", "I have one for Philippe and one for Jimmy, Tom or Philippe. Philippe, yeah, I know some people will say if they look at MTV\u2019s ratings and say that it\u2019s just a one year wonder. And I wondered if you can talk a bit about what you\u2019re doing at MTV to perhaps change the programming process and decision-making and be doing that at other networks as well?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Michael. Well, success breeds success in the television business. We have a reinvigorated, diversified programming team at MTV developing and producing diversified genres of programming. We have successfully initiated scripted programming initiatives. We are looking at animation again on MTV, as well as continued strength in the reality genre. As we produce the hits, it drives viewership to our networks, discovery of our new shows and engagement in our continuing hits.", "So we think that MTV\u2019s momentum, which is continuing in this quarter, has a good chance of enduring for some time to come. We are bringing the same approach to our other networks where we are increasing our investment in original programming.", "If you -- this is an interesting statistic, if you look at our major networks, the amount that we spend on original programming on major networks such as MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, is in the 90% neighborhood as compared to acquired programming. Across all of our major networks with the exception of TV Land for obvious reasons and Spike, that proportion is two-thirds or better.", "So it is great for the brands, original programming serves the brands better and it also increases our portfolio of owned programming, which we can distribute through new technologies and new geographies and that is a great strength of this company as compared to many of our peers.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Thanks. Here\u2019s a follow-up. In the past you\u2019ve said that we would expect your affiliate fees domestically to start slowing to high single-digit growth. I wonder is that still the case or are you getting more pricing out of maybe a mix shift to telco and satellite operators versus cable MSOs? So do we still expect a bit of a slowdown long-term in affiliate fee growth?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we\u2019ve said consistently that we feel comfortable for time to come because of our long-term affiliate deals that we will be increasing our affiliate revenues at a high single-digit, low double-digit pace, to the extent that household formation resumes that will increase our level of affiliate fee growth.", "And as we look forward into the future, affiliate fee growth could also be accelerated by the new opportunities that are presented in non-traditional forms of distribution. So I feel quite comfortable that we will be able to maintain and perhaps increase our affiliate fee growth in the years to come.", "Michael Nathanson \u2013 Nomura", "Okay. Thanks, Philippe.", "Jim Bombassei", "Operator, we\u2019ll go to our next question, please?", "Operator", "It will come from Imran Khan with JPMorgan.", "Imran Khan \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yeah. Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Two questions, first, Philippe, you talked about the ratings improvement at your cable networks. Could you just give us some sense like as the ratings are improving, are you going to monetize those ratings right away or you\u2019re seeing some lag on that?", "And secondly, I think there is a lot of concerns about Netflix whether that will drive the cost-cutting or reduce the TV viewership. Clearly, you were the first one to sign a large contract deal with them. What is your view about that as the new emerging distributors come in? Do you think the overall TV viewership might come under pressure because consumers will have more choices? Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Imran. There is -- look, we\u2019ve been able to monetize the ratings improvement at MTV. There is some lag, naturally, given the fact that a large portion of our ad sales are effectuated in the upfront market and we can really capitalize on excess rating delivery only in the scatter portion of our sales. So as we go ahead, we look forward to the next upfront season. We have continued strength in networks like MTV, again, that will create a solid base for growth as we go forward.", "As it relates to Netflix, Netflix itself has positioned itself not as being a substitute for television viewing but as a complementary service. And that is the way it is being used. I think it\u2019s remarkable that in the teeth of a powerful recession that we went through, continued viewership of subscription television has held up as well as it has.", "So I think there has been much ado about very little in terms of all the talk about cost-cutting. Television provides great value with a lot of choice. And certainly as it relates to our networks, we have actually seen the number of subscribers even on our fully-distributed or more fully-distributed networks increase from the data that we had through the second quarter. And that\u2019s because we continue to achieve incremental distribution through services like the telcos, which provide a broader array of channels than some of the other distributors in various markets.", "So we don\u2019t see cost-cutting as affecting our business. The economy, obviously, holds down the growth in distribution. As the economy recovers, we expect to see the number of the television subscribers in the U.S. grow at a better clip than it has over the last year and a half or so.", "Imran Khan \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thanks so much. Just interested in some more details if you could on advertising, is it relatively broad-based across all categories or are there just a few categories driving this is thin as, can you give us any sense of what is happening with the March quarter cancellations for the upfront?", "And then lastly, can you give us a sense, is it possible to give us a sense of where your direct response was as a percentage of ad revenue last year or what the trend has been over the last couple years? Is there more to go in terms of converting your DR to regular advertising? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome. I will pick up on some of those, I\u2019ll have Tom to jump in, if any he wants to amplify. As far as where our stress in advertising, the good news for us is that we have seen a growing strength in categories such as financial services, Toys and games have been strong for us, various household products. And so we are getting new categories, financial services for example have been a growing category from a very small base.", "And certain categories, which traditionally have been extremely strong for us and continue to be such as movies, where there had been fewer releases as we went through economic difficulties, that has stabilized. And we think as we look forward, as the pipeline of major releases grows over the next year or two that will be an opportunity for us going forward.", "Given the strength in the scatter market, the cancellation rate as far as the upfront has gone back to normal levels and where there is strength in the scatter market, where there are available units that can be converted from DR we are taking advantage of those opportunities.", "Tom Dooley", "Yeah. DR pricing is very strong and we are allocating less inventory to DR, but pricing on DR is strong and actually filling the bucket up in terms of the absolute revenue that it is generating.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Right.", "Tom Dooley", "But if there for us to displace DR for cash, but we are also seeing strength, a lot of strength in the DR marketplace.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "If I\u2019m thinking about that right that DR, the amount of DR you have is still an opportunity in fiscal \u201811 in terms of driving that growth.", "Tom Dooley", "Absolutely.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Tom Dooley", "We have inventory available to move out of it but we\u2019re also seeing, as we do that, we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in DR pricing.", "Doug Mitchelson \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you.", "Jim Bombassei", "Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll got to Richard Greenfield wit BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 BTIG", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two related questions, one on just the non-core asset sales. How much do you think you can raise from asset sales as you are looking to 2011, including Harmonix, are there other assets that kind of, Philippe, do not fit that kind of core business that you\u2019ve picked up over the years that could be year marked for sale and what will you do with those proceeds?", "And then just a question for Tom, when you look at leverage, you mentioned that you are on target for $400 million of buyback in the quarter. And while that\u2019s great sequentially from where you were not buying back stock. It seems like you continue to delever given what was $2 billion of free cash flow in the full 12 months period that you talked to. How do you reconcile the buyback pace with the extent of your free cash flow, which seems like you are going to continue to delever going forward? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thanks, Rich. I\u2019ll take the first question. As far as the non-core asset sales, the beauty of this company is that we are really very focused on content, the cable networks and the like. We really have at this point in time leaving Harmonix aside, we don\u2019t really have non-core assets.", "So we are in the midst, as I mentioned in my remarks, of a sale process for Harmonix. We expect that to be completed expeditiously. Obviously, we will announce the results when the deal is concluded and the proceeds will go into our bank account and then we will deploy it, as we described, in part by returning value to shareholders. Tom?", "Tom Dooley", "To your point, Rich, on deleveraging, we -- the company will naturally delever as, one, as it generates a free cash flow, but it will also delever as we generate incremental operating income levels.", "And as I said in my remarks, we will be considering adding additional debt to relever the company and we will continue to deploy that incremental capital that we raise, as we have done in the past, where we are going to either make some select small investments or we will return that capital to the shareholders. And you will see our buyback program and other vehicles to return capital to shareholders reflect that.", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 BTIG", "So we shouldn\u2019t be looking at 400 as a baseline of a quarterly growth rate? It will fluctuate and accelerate as you try to reach your target leverage ratios?", "Tom Dooley", "As we\u2019ve said in the past, we will do with the -- how much we are going to buy is going to be a function of the approximate forecast of how we are going to use cash in the next quarter and how much cash we have on hand at the end of the previous quarter.", "So it will go up and down. It won\u2019t go up and down dramatically, but it will go up and down quarter-to-quarter and reflect the seasonal quarterly cash variations that the company experiences. As you know, we have very high cash flows in sort of the December ending quarter and we have very high cash flows in sort of the September ending quarter and the first half of the year is sort of a lower cash flow period for us.", "Richard Greenfield \u2013 BTIG", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "You got it.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thank you. I\u2019d like to pick up on Philippe\u2019s comments on prepared -- in the prepared remarks about international. It sounds like that\u2019s a renewed focus for you. And I was just wondering if you could talk about the drivers of growth whether it is more channels or more countries or more programming. And separately, are you selling programs -- your programs not just to your cable, I mean not using just via cable networks, are you selling them to other platforms?", "And then the final thing on international is, could you tell us what the India change was year-over-year, it sounds like you\u2019ve moved from a loss to a profit.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Jessica. Yeah. We do intend to focus with the development of all the programming and the reinvigoration of our brands on growth in the international markets. There is a great opportunity there. There is an opportunity through traditional forms of distribution, as well as non-traditional forms of distribution, which will allow us to penetrate countries that have to date been closed to us and other Western companies.", "So we think it is a great opportunity. There is a great opportunity to build on the efficiencies that we have put in in our international operations. There is more opportunity there. That will also help drive our margins.", "We are expanding several of our brands. Nickelodeon reached its 51st territory. It will hit additional territory as we go forward. We\u2019ve reinvigorated brands like Viva and expanding it to other territories. COMEDY is another brand that we are going to expand and many others.", "So, yeah, there are expansion of channels in countries where we are present and penetration of additional countries. In the meantime, given our programming portfolio, we are syndicating programming in countries where we do not yet have a presence for some of our brands. So there are opportunities to license them there.", "Jessica Reif Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then India.", "Philippe Dauman", "Yeah. As far as India, we continue with Colors to be the top channel in India. That has also invigorated the distribution and results for the MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1 channels we have in India and our joint venture is planning to launch additional channels to add to the bouquet.", "We see India as a great market, strong economy, strong media business, we have a leading position there and we expect to create very significant asset value over many years to come there. So we\u2019ll capitalize on our advantage by expanding there and happily, we have very rapidly gone from the investment mode to profitability in India, which allows us to grow and create asset value.", "Jim Bombassei", "Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please?", "Operator", "That will come from David Miller with Caris & Company.", "David Miller \u2013 Caris & Company", "Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I just want to get it straight in terms of how you guys are accounting for the EPIX inflows or excuse me, yeah, the EPIX inflows from Netflix. My understanding is that Netflix will begin paying you guys for the deal as it stands right now in the current quarter. Are you going to book those fees essentially below the line in the current quarter or are you going to do it on a one-quarter lag the way Lionsgate does it? Thanks very much.", "Tom Dooley", "We do everything on a current quarter basis, so we are trued up right to the current quarter, simultaneous with our own reporting, we do\u2026", "David Miller \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay. Wonderful.", "Tom Dooley", "Yeah.", "David Miller \u2013 Caris & Company", "Wonderful. Thank you.", "Jim Bombassei", "We\u2019ll go to our next question, please?", "Operator", "Anthony DiClemente with Barclays Capital.", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi. Just one question for Tom, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m wondering about the scatter premium above upfront prices as we go to the new TV season from the old. I\u2019m just wondering if you are seeing the same level of premium or if, just given the higher prices on inventory that you realized in the spring upfront, if that premium has narrowed. And then maybe even just to take it a step further, how should we think about that in terms of your positioning on pricing you might be able to achieve in the 2011 upfront? Thank you.", "Tom Dooley", "Right now, everything is looking very good in terms of the scatter premiums in terms of scatter-to-upfront and scatter-to-scatter. We are very, very, very happy with the demand we are seeing in the marketplace. And if that continues into the first quarter and to Philippe\u2019s point, if the economy continues to show the signs of life and improvement, we will see major dollars coming out of the categories which drive our advertising revenue line. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic about that and feel pretty good about how we are setting up into the upfront. In particular, since we have strong lineups across some of our key networks, which will be big drivers of the upfront for us.", "Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital", "That\u2019s good. Thank you.", "Tom Dooley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks and good morning. Two quick questions, for Philippe or Tom, I guess. Some of the cable and satellite operators have talked a little bit about potentially offering thinner tiers to appeal to lower income homes. I was wondering if you could talk about how that may or may not impact distribution for some of your fully-distributed networks.", "And then secondly, for Jimmy real quick, can you just give us what the Harmonix revenue and EBIT was in the September quarter, excluding all the various asset write-downs and charges? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Spencer. Well, we, obviously, there have always been lower tiers of service as the family tier, which was distributed by several operators. It actually achieved very little penetration. We don\u2019t think this will be a major factor. But to the extent you do get low income homes who have a choice between getting a low tier or not having a subscription at all, there is a market there.", "We generally do quite well in that our networks such as Nickelodeon, MTV are key networks in any tier of service. So it is a marginal factor and may serve to retain certain customers who cannot afford at the lower end of the economic, to retain a subscription at the lower end of the economic spectrum.", "Tom Dooley", "Also, the growth that we are seeing is being driven by the people that are offering a more robust array of programming. And as Philippe referred to before, we are experiencing growth in subscribers, because the people that are offering the more comprehensive package of channels are the ones that are experiencing the growth.", "In terms of the Harmonix transaction, Harmonix in the quarter from an EBITDA point of view had sort of a loss of around $65 million. However, that loss reflects how we\u2019ve been informed by the potential buyers we\u2019ve been talking about, that loss would not have been that significant, it would have been less than half of that amount, had it not been for sort of our pursuing a transaction with third parties. The third parties have a different economic view of Harmonix and we believe that it is an asset that will be worth more to them than it is to us and that is why we\u2019ve decided to go down the road. Jimmy, do you have the revenue number on it?", "Jimmy Barge", "I don\u2019t have that in front of me. But Spencer, you will be able to see that in trending schedules with the recast financials.", "Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Jason Bazinet with Citi.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi", "I just have a quick question on international affiliate. It would seem that given the nascent stage of pay-TV and the rapid growth of pay-TV subscribers, and the fact that your networks aren\u2019t fully distributed that the affiliate number internationally should be growing much more quickly than domestic and most of it, I would think, would come from new homes as opposed to rate.", "I think we\u2019ve had a couple quarters where international has grown a little bit more slowly even if you strip out FX and I think you said on the call that in this quarter at least 80% of it was from rate. So I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of color on what the underlying impediments are of that line item growing more quickly? Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, as we sped into new territories and launched new networks, in many countries there are not affiliate fees available or in some cases there are, we have to pay certain amounts in order to get distribution of networks that will sustain growth for us in the future, in ad sales and future affiliate fees.", "So yeah, there are a lot of ins and outs as you expand internationally. Our objective, obviously, is to grow, as we do domestically both affiliate, as well as, advertising sales in international markets, as they become more mature.", "And internationally, it is also a great opportunity for us, particularly with the Nickelodeon brand to grow absolute product sales on the heels of our expansion of that and certain of our other brands across the world.", "Tom Dooley", "Jason, in this particular quarter, we had a tough comp with last year. Last year\u2019s affiliate fee growth was in the mid to high teens growth rate. So it is a little bit of a tough comp. Other thing that happened in this quarter, there was a relatively sizable market where we shifted from an affiliate fee structure to a wider distributed structure where we actually sacrificed some affiliate fee to create an opportunity for an expanded advertising base.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi", "I see and so you book long support as account of revenue then, is that right?", "Tom Dooley", "To the extent we would pay it, yeah.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Great. Thank you everyone for joining us for our earnings call this morning.", "Operator", "Thank you again. That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended December 31, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.

", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We're extremely happy to be here today. I'm glad that you joined us.", "Viacom, as you know, generated solid results in our first quarter. And importantly, we are extremely well-positioned creatively, operationally, and financially for a strong fiscal 2011.", "Our focus on creating the world's greatest entertainment. Greatest entertainment content defines Viacom. Today, everyone talks about the value of content. But at Viacom, we have always known that content that connects with audiences was the key to our destiny and to our long-term growth that our investors seek.", "We have continued to nurture our global brands to ensure that they reflect our audience\u2019s interests and that they reside with equal confidence in both the linear world and rapidly evolving digital world. Every year seems to bring a new opportunity, a new device for consumers to engage with our content.

With a clear mission, the right assets, unlimited creative fire power and a proven management team, Viacom. Viacom has what it needs to build on its success and capitalize on the many new opportunities.", "Now, of course, I will turn this call over to my extremely close friend, Viacom's President and CEO, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us. ", "Viacom closed out the first quarter of our new fiscal year in great shape. Every part of the company is strong and getting stronger. 2011 is shaping up to be a terrific year.", "During the first quarter of our fiscal year, we made progress on our top priorities. We continued to invest in revitalizing our brands and creating more original programming that will resonate with our audiences. We enhanced our marketing efforts, utilizing innovative campaigns and taking advantage of new media to build awareness. We further expanded our advertising base as the marketplace strengthens and built on our already powerful affiliate relationships. We delivered a compelling slate of motion pictures while maintaining a disciplined cost structure at the studio. And finally, across the company, we kept a close eye on maintaining and enhancing efficiencies, which helped us to drive strong free cash flow and to return capital to our stockholders.", "Looking ahead, our businesses are firing on all cylinders. We have groundbreaking programming across every screen, and the audiences are responding in impressive numbers. This puts our Media Networks in an extremely good position as we prepare for the upcoming advertising upfront.", "Internationally, our channel and programming strategies are driving broader distribution and strengthening our brands around the world. Our motion picture studio is in excellent shape. Operationally, the studio is stronger than it's been in many years, and creatively, we have an unparalleled lineup of franchise films coming to theaters this year as well as an enviable portfolio of projects in development.", "Today, I will briefly review our financial results and spend some time talking about the highlights for our divisions. Jimmy and Tom will provide additional detail on our performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. ", "Now to the numbers. As always, we'll speak to the adjusted numbers during our discussion this morning. Our consolidated revenues were $3.83 billion in the first quarter, down 5%, as solid gains in Media Networks were more than offset by declines in our Filmed Entertainment segment. Media Networks delivered 6% growth in revenues and a 7% increase in adjusted operating income on strong increases in both advertising and affiliate revenues. The top and bottom line declines in Filmed Entertainment primarily reflect, as expected, a challenging year-over-year comparison in home entertainment.", "Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased 11% to $620 million in the December quarter, and diluted earnings per share were $1.02, down 11% from $1.14 earned in the prior year. We also continued to return capital to shareholders with the resumption of our stock repurchase program and our quarterly cash dividend. During the first quarter fiscal 2011, we purchased $400 million in stock, and we are on track to purchase another $400 million in stock in the current quarter.", "For the full fiscal year 2011, we plan to purchase at least $1.75 billion in stock and expect to complete the remainder of our current $4 billion buyback program sometime in fiscal 2012. We also plan to discuss with our Board an increase our dividend beginning with the dividend payable on July 1.  ", "Let's move on to our Media Networks. Our major cable networks are on a roll, and that strong performance is the result of our thoughtful and disciplined strategy over the past several years. In a nutshell, it's about investing in the right research, the right programming, the right marketing and the right people. Our top-flight and unique approach to market research provides us with a deep understanding of our audiences and ensures that our brands continue not only to resonate, but also to shape the viewing habits of those audiences. ", "Research informs everything we do: how we position our brands, how we invest our content dollars, how we program each network, we develop our marketing plans, even how we window and monetize content across new platforms.", "Over the last three years, we have increased our research investment across our brand portfolio by more than 15%. Today, we're doing more consumer insights work than ever before at all of our brands. We are also sharing those insights further upstream in the content development process, not just internally, but also with the outside producers with whom we worked. As a result, we've steadily expanded the type of programming we put on our networks. More animation on Comedy, new scripted sitcoms on TV Land and CMT, a broader mix of scripted and unvarnished reality programming for MTV and more scripted programs for BET. You'll see all of those genres growing in our networks today because of our continuous investment in programming and programmers.", "Even through the worst economic downturn in nearly a century, we continue to allocate resources to feed our content pipeline. Our investment in programming last year was 25% higher than it was when I became CEO in 2006, a compounded annual growth rate of about 6%. At the same time, through disciplined cost controls in every other area of the business, we were also able to expand our Media Networks operating margins, even as we operated through a major recession.", "And since we own most of our programming, around 90% of some of our major networks, we can look forward to rapidly growing opportunities to monetize this content across multiple platforms and to expand it into new geographies around the globe.", "All of this new content needs to be marketed in a way that breaks through the noise, and in this regard, our capabilities are unmatched in the industry. Today, we are investing in more off-channel messaging to raise awareness and bring in the audiences. We are also capitalizing on new and emerging media. For example, the MTV brand and individual show pages on Facebook collectively have more than 45 million fans, and in some cases, we're providing those fans with the tools to be our loudest advocates. Our consistent investment in research, in programming and in marketing, and, I'd add, superb execution, produces the kind of rating success we're enjoying today, which is exactly why advertisers want to be associated with our brands and on our networks. ", "Highlighting our deep connection with audiences, we announced today a new agreement Hulu, extending into 2012 a return to Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report to Hulu. Equally important, this deal creates a new and complementary window for our current and library programs on Hulu Plus that brings us new revenues through subscription fees and ad sales. A selection of current programs will be available to Hulu Plus subscribers beginning 21 days after they air.", "Our domestic advertising revenues grew 10% in the quarter, driven by a strong scatter market. Kids, youth and adult spending on our networks all increased. We continue to attract non-endemic advertisers, particularly on our Nickelodeon networks, which attracted a number of new substantial advertisers in the packaged goods, auto and insurance categories. With a strong scatter market, money came in earlier in the first quarter as buyers became increasingly concerned about price. ", "Looking at the current quarter, we expect to again deliver double-digit growth in domestic ad revenues even though the Kids' Choice Awards, which was a major revenue generator in the March quarter last year, falls into the next quarter this year.", "On the international side, we are also very much on track to deliver double-digit organic growth in ad sales in our fiscal 2011 second quarter. With strong ratings momentum and compelling new programming in the wings, we are looking forward to a particularly robust upfront this spring. So let's take a brief look at some of the programming highlights at our networks.", "MTV is back on the moment. Its programming is attracting bigger, broader audiences than ever before, and it is driving the cultural conversation. Importantly, its success has been deep and broad-based. Last quarter, MTV had three of the top five original cable series with Jersey Shore, Teen Mom, and Sixteen and Pregnant. Strong programming across the network drove double-digit ratings gains in total day, prime, late night and weekends. And the ratings continue to climb.", "Last month, the Season 3 premiere of Jersey Shore was the network's highest rated series telecast ever with 8.45 million viewers. In fact, Jersey Shore is a top five show on all of television, including broadcast, not just in young demos, but in 18 to 49 year olds, and this, at 10 p.m. on Thursday night, the most important night in television. And it continues to set new viewership records as the season unfolds, a trend I'm sure will continue all the way to Season 4 on the shores of Italy.", "The audience for Teen Mom 2 has grown each week since its strong premiere in January, pulling in an average of 4 million total viewers, and the new original scripted series, Skins, averaged a 1.6 and 1.5 coverage rating in the last two weeks. Coming up, My Life as Liz returns for a second season, Real World heads to Las Vegas for its 25th season and we'll debut another scripted show, Teen Wolf.", "BET, which has successfully implemented its new brand strategy, is now also enjoying its rising renaissance. We have more than doubled our investment in original programming for BET over the past several years, and it is paying off with a total day audience in the past month growing 23% year-over-year.", "The cable debut of THE GAME last month ranked as the top, ad-supported scripted series premiere in cable history with 7.7 million total viewers. That was followed by the romantic comedy, Let's Stay Together, and it debuted to 4.4 million viewers. Ratings for both of these shows continue to be strong. The network is producing these shows in-house in Atlanta, which improves their cost structure, and they joined fan favorites such as FAMILY CREWS and BLACK GIRLS ROCK! as well as established BET tentpoles like BET Honors, Rip the Runway and the BET Awards. ", "Original programming on Comedy Central continues to deliver more core viewers. South Park and Tosh.0 both delivered impressive growth last quarter, and the latest Tosh season is building on that progress. And even though there are at the top of their game, both The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report just keep getting better. Both shows increased their 18- to 49-year-old audiences by 8% in the quarter despite a new entrance in the late night category on cable. Comedy will continue to build on their success with great originals. It recently launched The Onion SportsDome and announced a new tentpole, The Comedy Awards, which will premiere at the beginning of the next quarter. We will air the Roast of Donald Trump in March. Donald, best of luck.", "The Nickelodeon Kids and Family Group is on top of all their targeted demos and the networks continue to add new hits. Nick holds four of the top five preschool programs in commercial television led by Team Umizoomi. iCarly, Big Time Rush and Victorious rank among the top five live-action series for kids 6 to 11 and tweens 9 to 14. And the network is launching four new series this quarter. ", "The Nick at Nite audience increased 8% in the quarter, driven by its newest acquisition, My Wife and Kids. You can find strong original programming on each of our networks. Some are already blockbusters, like the award-winning Hot in Cleveland on TV Land. Others are solid hits, such as Celebrity Rehab on VH1 and Auction Hunters on Spike, and still others are up and coming, including Retired at 35 on TV Land, Blue Mountain State on Spike, and Working Class, CMT's first full-ranged of [ph] scripted programming, which premiered last week to a record 1.2 million viewers, making it the most-watched series debut in the network's history.", "Now let me address our international operations. Last month, we announced the formation of the Viacom International Media Networks group, headed by Bob Bakish. This new organizational structure brings together all of Viacom's non-premium international television networks and related digital properties to create a far more efficient and influential organization. The growth potential of our media properties in international markets cannot be overstated. We have a well-established global footprint that we have been refining over the past few years, always striving to optimize our presence and increase distribution in the individual markets. ", "In the last quarter, we increased the distribution of Nickelodeon by 30% in Russia, moved MTV to a more widely distribute tier on Sky in the U.K., and launched three networks on a basic tier pack in Australia. We have also created substantial efficiencies by consolidating many of our international creative functions into two regional studios while still maintaining a local flavor in every market.", "For example, we're garnering impressive audiences for MTV's Ni\u00f1as Mal telenovela, which is number one in Colombia, Mexico and Argentina; and across Latin America, the Nickelodeon original telenovela, Sue\u00f1a Conmigo, continues to rank high. ", "Properties such as MTV World Stage are powerful content assets globally, but they also build significant brand awareness of local loyalty where the live concerts are filmed. We expect our international operations to grow significantly in importance and even more significantly in profitability over the next several years.", "Now let's switch to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount Pictures had an impressive first quarter to box office. The studio released or distributed seven films and chalked up an extremely high hit rate, driving our theatrical revenues up three-fold in the quarter. Our films received critical acclaim with numerous award nominations. Paramount garnered the most Oscar nominations of any studio: 10 for True Grit; seven for The Fighter, which already won two Golden Globes; two nominations for DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon and one for Iron Man 2. ", "Our home entertainment quarterly results primarily reflect a challenging year-over-year comparison with the release of our three 2009 blockbuster films Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Star Trek and G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra. As we move through the rest of fiscal 2011, we won't have those kinds of difficult comps. In fact, our successful theatrical releases will become a powerful home entertainment slate as the fiscal year unfolds. ", "As we saw with the success of films such as Jackass 3D, which is an MTV film, and Paranormal Activity 2, our focus on developing branded films and franchises is paying off. These types of films have a built-in fan base, which significantly increases their chance of success in every distribution window. You will see more of these branded and franchised films in the coming months and years. For example, next week, Paramount and MTV Films release Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, a film that was developed jointly by the studio and MTV and brought to theaters in record time. And I feel quite confident that Justin's impressive fan base will turn out in droves.", "And next month, our tentpole Rango, a Nickelodeon movie starring Johnny Depp, hits theaters. Later in the year, we will distribute DreamWorks Animation sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 and, of course, the highly anticipated Transformers: Dark of the Moon in 3D and a terrific new franchise, Super 8.", "In conclusion, we're off to a great start in fiscal 2011. The creative momentum in our major networks is building as we judiciously invest in original programming. This puts Viacom in the pole position in the race to capitalize on new opportunities for monetizing television content through emerging media here and around the world. We're excited about the potential for expanding our international businesses, and we know that our film studio is poised for a great year. Running our businesses efficiently will always be a top priority. But equally important is fostering an environment in which the tremendous creativity that exists across the company can thrive. We are doing both today, and we'll continue to do so tomorrow. And that will lead to even greater success for Viacom and for its investors. ", "Now I will turn it over to our CFO, Jimmy Barge.", "James Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.", "This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results exclude from last year's December quarter $50 million of discrete tax benefits related to prior audit settlements, as well as a non-cash impairment charge at Media Networks related to certain broadcast licenses, which had a $60 million impact at the operating level and a $19 million impact on net income. As a reminder, Harmonix is classified as discontinued operation in all periods presented.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 6% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues increased 8% and International revenues declined 6% in the quarter.", "Foreign exchange added two percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.", "Page 9 of your web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, Domestic advertising revenues grew 10% in the quarter. International advertising declined 7% with Foreign exchange reducing the growth rate by three percentage points.", "International ad sales in the quarter were impacted by the timing of event-driven programming. In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 11% while international revenues increased 4%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by two percentage points.", "Approximately 80% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. In terms of international affiliate revenues, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate increases, new channel launches, as well as increased subscribers. ", "Now moving to Ancillary revenues, worldwide Ancillary revenues declined 18% in the quarter, principally reflecting lower consumer products and home entertainment revenues. The decline in home entertainment revenues reflects fewer releases compared to last year.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion in the quarter was 7% higher than last year. The operating margin of 44% improved 60 basis points over the prior year. The improvement in the margin was driven by the 4% growth rate in total expenses.", "Within expenses, programming expenses grew 10%, while SG&A expense grew 2%.  The low-single-digit growth in SG&A expense was due to higher employee cost offset by the timing of advertising and promotion expense.", "Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter declined 16% to $1.5 billion. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. ", "Worldwide Theatrical revenues increased $323 million to $416 million in the quarter. The Theatrical results were driven by a greater number of releases in the current quarter, including the successful and profitable films, Jackass 3D, Paranormal Activity 2, True Grit and DreamWorks Animation's Megamind.", "Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 44% to $638 million. As we had anticipated, the decline reflects difficult comparisons with last year's DVD release of Transformers 2, Star Trek and G.I. Joe, as well as lower catalog sales.", "TV license fees declined 38% to $274 million. The decline in TV license fees principally reflects the number of titles available in the pay TV, foreign syndication and network TV marketplaces during the quarter.", "Ancillary revenues increased 56% to $169 million as we benefited from the guarantee related to the sale of the distribution rights to the Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $68 million in the quarter, which was $234 million lower than last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparisons with the prior year's home video performance of Transformers 2, Star Trek and G.I. Joe, as well as lower TV license fees, partially offset by the sale of the distribution rights to Marvel. Since no Paramount releases became available to our Epix pay TV joint venture during the quarter, there was no impact on Paramount's results.", "Now moving below operating income, total company, equity income from investment was $24 million in the quarter. The income principally relates to our investments in Epix and our Viacom 18 India TV venture, both of which were profitable in the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, reflecting a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year adjusted rate. The reduction in effective tax rate reflects an improved mix of taxable income from our international operations. ", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thanks, Jimmy. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to shareholders. I'll also talk about seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2011 fiscal year.", "Now moving to our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $701 million in operating free cash flow in the December quarter compared to just over $1 billion last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating cash flow was principally due to an unfavorable working capital variance and lower operating income, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The unfavorable working capital variance was impacted by the timing of annual incentive compensation payments related to the change in our fiscal year-end. So these payments we're made in the December quarter of this year, whereas last year, they were made in the March quarter.", "In addition, working capital was negatively impacted by production spending for upcoming tentpole releases including Rango, Super 8 and Mission Impossible 4. As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of approximately 6%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper market place at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter.", "In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $911 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, our $2 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x, which is our target level. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent four quarters be at least 3x, and at the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was over 8x. ", "In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, on October 1, we commenced purchases under our $4 billion stock repurchase program. For the December quarter, we bought back $400 million of our stock. On both October 1 and December 30, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. So in the December quarter, we returned a total of $582 million of capital to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $400 million of our stock in the March quarter.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2011. In terms of advertising and some of the timing factors, the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards on Nickelodeon will air on April 2 of this year, whereas last year, it aired on March 27. Also, Easter falls later in April this year.", "In spite of this impact, given the robust scatter market and the ratings success of a number of our new and return series, we anticipate that our domestic ad sales will grow double digits in the March quarter. We also anticipate that international ad sales will grow double digits in the March quarter, as we see strength in Europe and Latin America and as we benefit from a number of strategic initiatives including new programming launches as well as improved channel positions in certain territories.", "At Media Networks, our targeted annual growth rate for fiscal 2011 programming expense remains mid-single-digits. However, due to the timing of new shows coming on air, this growth rate will fluctuate on a quarterly basis. We will find cost efficiencies in operating areas that will enable us to continue to enhance our margins as we invest in our programming. Given our current estimate of our domestic versus international profitability mix, we are now forecasting a booked tax rate of 35% for fiscal 2011. ", "As we look to the back half of our fiscal year, we are in great shape. At Media Networks, we have had breakout ratings performance for several new and returning series that we have launched. We are seeing stronger volumes in a number of key advertising categories, and we have made progress in growing several non-endemic categories.", "At the studio, we are optimistic about our upcoming slate. On March 4, we will be releasing Rango, our new animated franchise picture under the Nickelodeon film label. In June, Paramount releases the J.J. Abrams directed Super 8 and on July 1, Transformers 3 in 3D will be released. In addition, we will be distributing Marvel's Thor and Captain America as well, as well as DreamWorks Animation's Kung-Fu Panda 2. ", "Given the growth in our earnings that we see as we progress through this year, we anticipate purchasing north of the $1.75 billion of our stock in fiscal 2011.", "To wrap up, over the past couple of years, we have put in place a number of strategic initiatives that have begun to pay off and positioned Viacom for long-term growth. At Media Networks, we have put a renewed focus on research and understanding our audiences in order to develop programming that resonates with our viewers. We have increased the level of original programming on our networks and have seen the benefits of this translate into our ratings. We have secured long-term growth in our affiliate revenues, and we continue to drive efficiencies in our operations, which have enabled us to grow our core margins for the last seven quarters. At Paramount, we have rationalized our investment in film production and focused on developing franchise films. This has put the studio on a path to greater profitability and higher margins. We have also invested in several joint ventures, both our Epix pay TV and our Viacom 18 India TV ventures have transitioned from the investment stage to successful and profitable operations that create asset value for our company. ", "In addition, we have enhanced our balance sheet and our financial position, which will enable us to continue to return significant capital to our shareholders over the coming years. Combined, these initiatives have put us on a path to a strong top-line and bottom-line growth and improving returns for our shareholders. ", "With that, I want to thank you for listening, and now, we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Philippe, I think the improving content cycle is the real story here, right? So at this point, given your race of events [ph] is probably better than any of the other major groups. Does it follow that in this year's upfront, your CPM increases should be higher than peers, because it's been a few years since that's been the case? If I could ask a second, just curious about your description of the Hulu deal as a new window, 21 days after airing, does that imply that you\u2019d cut a similar deal with Netflix?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, we feel extremely well-positioned for the upfront. We actually had, yesterday, early in the season, an MTV Network upfront presentation. And the response from our advertisers, both on our existing franchises and the new shows coming on stream, was very exciting. So, yes, we are targeting the high range of CPM increases as we go into the upfront season, given our great ratings and programming success. As far as Hulu goes, we are very interested in the new business plan that Hulu has come forward with, because it replicates the dual revenue streams that we enjoy in the traditional distribution realm. We will be enjoying both advertising revenue streams and subscription revenue streams. The programming that we will be putting on Hulu Plus will include a large number of library programming that we have. That's targeted to young audiences, obviously. And we have a selection of current programs that will not air on Hulu Plus until at least 21 days after they've aired on television. And that, in our view, is a window that makes it complementary and makes the revenues that we are getting under this deal incremental to our revenues. And that's really our strategy as we expand our participation broadband and mobile window. As far as Netflix goes, we have a library product on Netflix right now, and we look forward to discussing with Netflix growth in our relationship, both in economics and helping to drive our business and their business, and possibly an expansion in the programming lineup for Netflix.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Is the Hulu deal relatively short term so you can gauge any impact on ratings? Or is this sort of a long-term partnership?", "Philippe Dauman", "The Hulu deal extends into 2012. So, yes, we do have the opportunity to see how the business evolves. Generally speaking, our deals for our cable networks and broadband distribution will be shorter in term for now than traditional affiliate deals.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "Philippe, the question would be is, we\u2019ve heard that you said the first quarter is picking up momentum in scatter, can you give us a sense on scatter versus scatter pricing in the March quarter versus the December quarter?", "Philippe Dauman", "Again, the momentum keeps building. Our endemic categories are showing signs of strength when you think about motion picture outputs, the types of pictures that are targeting young audiences. Beverages, you see non-endemic categories for us are becoming more significant like autos and insurance, packaged goods. So we're seeing the pricing, particularly on the adult networks growth, scatter versus scatter. And a lot of it is driven by the excitement and cultural resonance of a lot of the shows. It's really getting people's attention. And we're not just talking about MTV, but we're talking about BET and Comedy Central. BET has come out with these new scripted shows that are not just leading its demographic categories by a lot, as it always has, but really breakout shows for television in general. So that should help continue to drive our pricing, particularly as we deliver large audiences on our shows that expand beyond our target demos.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "I guess my question was, as you lead into the next quarter, is it pricing and/or volume that's giving you the improvement?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we see both with the ratings improvement, we'll have more volume. And the success of the shows and attracting new advertisers and the economic recovery that we see underway will help drive pricing.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "If rumor is right and Amazon wants to get into the Online Film business, is there any stopping you from selling Epix to an online distributor like Amazon relative to your deal you have with Netflix?", "Philippe Dauman", "The deal that Epix has with Netflix involves, as far as broadband-only distributors, we had a two-year period of exclusivity beginning when the deal started. So we're into that period. We are allowed to distribute under the Netflix deal on broadband with the traditional distributors who have broadband offering. And you may see some of that as we go forward. So at the end of that two-year period, we will be free for Epix to continue to distribute to Netflix, of course, but also to look to other distributors who are broadband-only.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "When you look at your equity and affiliates, I think you mentioned that both the major businesses in there were profitable, wondering whether -- as we think about timing, was there anything unique to this quarter that led to the strength, and should we think about that as kind of a run rate as we go forward over the next several quarters, given what happened with Epix and Netflix last year? And two, just on programming costs, Tom, I think you said that you were looking for mid-single digits for the full year. And I think the first quarter, the comment was that you were up double digits or 10%. I assume that means you should see much better margin improvement, barring a change in SG&A over the next several quarters. Is that fair to say for Media Networks?", "Philippe Dauman", "I\u2019ll address the profitability, and let Tom address the second question. Yes, Epix has achieved profitability, thanks to both the traditional distribution and the Netflix deal, of course, within a year of launch, which is unprecedented for a national network. We now have Epix on solid profitability settings, so you can expect to see that continue. The degree of profitability will be impacted by availabilities on pay that affect the cost side, of course, on increasing distribution. At the end of the quarter, we had a new distributor in Suddenlink, and you can expect to see additional distribution announcements as time unfolds. Tom?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, Rich. On the first and second quarters of 2011, programming expense will be running on the higher end of the curve, and then that will come back into line as we get to the second half of the year. And that's due to the way the price and amortization streams of the shows that we put in place in the first half of the year. SG&A will also kind of move around a little bit, but we will continue to try and drive margin growth in each of the quarters between now and the end of the year.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "And just Philippe, when you made the comment about Epix and the availability of titles, I think you mentioned that there were no major titles made available from Paramount this quarter. So was there basically an unusually high equity pickup from Epic this quarter versus what we should expect on a full-year basis?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, no. You had -- I mean, that was made up by having titles, a lot of titles from Lionsgate that were available in the quarter. So it depends on the seats [ph]. On an overall basis, the availability of titles is pretty steady. But there could be certain quarters where you just have a lot of avails that impact the cost side, giving the recognition of cost accounting for a venture like Epix. On the other hand, our revenues keep growing. So, we are on a solid path. Epix is in profitability territory for good. And now, it's a question of driving profitability. As we go forward, that will be largely influenced by expansion of our existing distribution relationships and the new distribution relationships that are coming on stream.", "Thomas Dooley", "Because it won't be a straight line as you go forward quarter after quarter, but it is pacing at a rate that we'll be able to continue at for the full year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was just wondering if you could address the improvement at Paramount. It's had its best performance in years in Theatrical. Is there anything structural going on? I mean, you talked about cable networks investing in research. And then as a separate topic, on the kids\u2019 area as you go into the upfront, do you expect any impact from your newer competition, any impact either on the upfront or on scatter?", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as Paramount goes, yes, we have made several structural changes at Paramount over the last two, three years. Obviously, from a cost standpoint, we have really looked for increasing efficiencies in our overhead, and Paramount has done a great job in that regard and continues to. And then our film strategy has evolved. We have reduced the number of releases. We target approximately 15 releases a year. And those releases are very much focused and anchored on franchises like Transformers, like Star Trek, like Mission Impossible, like others in development, and our brands. And you can see with Jackass 3D, as an example, you'll see with the Justin Bieber movie being released next week, they take advantage of our brands, our cable brands' reach, they tend to be more low cost and put it all together, you have a better risk-reward profile for the studio both compared to our past but also compared to the competition. So we feel very good about the direction, and, creatively, Paramount is in as good a shape as I've seen in many, many years. As far as the kids\u2019 area, Nickelodeon continues to be very, very strong. Every new program it has launched for quite some time has been successful, both for young kids and tweens. And the new competition has not been a factor, thus far. Its ratings have not yet been significant. We never underestimate competition, of course. But Nickelodeon has a very, very strong position, and the ratings on Nickelodeon are many, many, many times higher than the new competition. But we don't see any impact as we head into the upfront.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Evercore Partners.", "Alan Gould - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Philippe, I was wondering if you can drill down a little bit into the 10% ad sales -- ad domestic, ad revenue growth for this quarter. I mean, 10% is a very good number, but when we look at your ratings and we look at the results that Time Warner and News Corp. gave yesterday, I think there might have been some expectations it could have been even better than that. What is the difference, is it that your '10, '11 upfront was not as strong as theirs, are you just not generating the same revenue per CPM or per gross rating points that they are, could you just go into that a little bit given the rating strength?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, the ratings strength, sales of course. Many of our biggest drivers have been big hit shows that have come on air towards the latter part of the last calendar year as well as -- if you look at the last month. BET, for example, with its two new scripted shows, a lot of our scripted programming is coming on-stream with great success. I would point out that we've had great sequential improvement in ad sales growth for several quarters now with each quarter bringing greater sequential growth. So, there's more for us to do to take advantage of these new shows that are coming on-stream. There couldn't be a better time for all our important brands to be enjoying such success as we head in to the upfront season, so we feel very comfortable about the trajectory in ad sales.", "Thomas Dooley", "And some of our competitors, Alan, had the benefit of some pretty strong sports programming in that quarter, which I think gave them a lot of volume and pricing power, as that category continues to sort of be very strong in the space. And the way the upfront spreads is not exactly linear in terms of how it's booked quarter to quarter to quarter. And the first quarter can be a little light for us, given the mix. Certain of our programming will get stronger as we go throughout the year.", "Alan Gould - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Tom, what was your ratings growth in the December quarter in your core demos? And is the March quarter ratings growth trending better than the December quarter was?", "Thomas Dooley", "Well if you look at MTV, they had a great quarter last quarter. It's trending this quarter about 18%, 20% level. BET is trending about the same level over the past month. Nickelodeon continues to -- it's been picking up, actually, the last couple of weeks and has been very, very steady with all the new shows coming on. We have a couple of networks that had been lagging, but, again, they've stabilized and we have more programming and applying a brand filter to those networks that will lift them up, again, focusing on new original programming including scripted programming on networks like Spike and VH1. So the trend line looks very good.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham & Company.", "Laura Martin - Needham & Company, LLC", "I'd like to follow up, Philippe, with something that Doug asked you. So from the outside, we saw you had product on Hulu, then you pulled it off and then you put it back on, which we thought was interesting. And then in follow up to your answer to Doug, you were talking about maybe what changed was that they gave two revenue streams, advertising plus subscription revenue stream. And I think all these premium, all the premium content companies want their revenue to be incremental. So I guess I'm interested in hearing from you, as you think about moving your premium content to over-the-top platforms, what should we expect to see that you're going to -- what is your policy here in terms of what you need in order to move your content onto over-the-top platforms that you think, therefore, will be additive?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, yes, I would also add to what you said that as the broadband distributors become strong and get -- they have an ability to pay more for programming. We saw that in a very significant way in the Epix deal with Netflix, where the amount that Netflix was able to pay increased significantly over the more than a year that we were having discussions with them because of their success in reaching consumers. There are many other distributors out there that we're in conversations with. Some of them will be more successful than others. All of them would like to have our content. And we look at what their economic model is and what the potential is for us. We like the dual revenue stream. But again, different distributors will have different models, and we're willing to explore those. The other arena that will be interesting in this regard will be mobile, as you get more capability on mobile. And we're beginning to look at opportunities there. So really, the criteria would be, can we obtain significant revenues and attractive economic model without undermining existing forms of distribution? And windowing is very important in this arena. Yes, windowing has always been...", "Laura Martin - Needham & Company, LLC", "Yes. I know windowing has always been your primary strategy.", "Philippe Dauman", "Windowing has always been very important in our industry, and we'll be experimenting with those. And people's thinking has evolved, and the Hulu deal reflects another evolution in that regard.", "Laura Martin - Needham & Company, LLC", "And back just to follow up on a prior answer, can't remember -- I don't know if it was Tom or Jimmy that was giving it. But on the issue of sports, we're writing a lot about the economics of the sports leagues, and one of the things we are seeing with some of your competitors is, they're grabbing sports and they're putting them on their channels, and that is giving those channels more affiliate fee negotiating power. Are you finding that, when you walk into some of these satellite telco cable companies, that they are trying to re-grab from you part of your payments, to put you under pressure because you actually don't own sports, and they're getting under a lot of pressure because of growing retransmission consent payments. How do you protect your affiliate fee revenue streams without sports is my question.", "Philippe Dauman", "We haven't seen that at all. We provide great value to our distributors. We deliver now close to 22% of all viewing on ad-supported cable, and our proportion of affiliate fees is much lower than that. We also provide great value on traditional distributors VOD platforms and otherwise. So we have negotiated several extensions during this time period very successfully, and you see the results in our affiliate fee growth. Yet the scope and diversity of our brands puts us in a strong position. We don't have sports, but we have brands like BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, Spike that just have passionate audiences and our affiliates, as well as their ultimate consumers, appreciate what we provide.", "James Barge", "And to some extent, the prices for those audiences get drafted up, that benefits us greatly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Philippe, I just need to go back again to the Hulu topic. There's an argument out there that the younger generation that Viacom certainly monetizes the best is the one that's most interested in getting content on new platforms. And at the same time, probably the ones maybe with the highest risk of video cord cutting. It sounds like you guys have done a lot of consumer research on how that generation is consuming and interested in getting their content, which I'm sure led you to the place where there\u2019s a lot of money to be made on broadband distribution, but probably also a decent amount of risk. And so what I wanted to ask you about is, when you do these deals with Hulu or Netflix, are you assuming that there's really no risk that you see people transition to a broadband-only entertainment option in the home? Or are you striking deals where, if that takes place, you're setting the economics so that Viacom comes out flatter or even ahead based on sort of the numbers behind these deals? I know windowing is important, but so much viewing is now on-demand that I'm wondering if windowing is becoming, actually, less relevant in the future. Just curious on your thoughts there.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we find the Hulu and Netflix services to be complementary to television viewing. And we look at windowing not just on an aggregate basis, but we look at it based on particular shows or genres, for example, Daily Show and Colbert will be available on a much shorter window because it is a topical show. We have a new show every day, and what we found through our own sites and other distribution is that the online viewing of yesterday's show actually drives a viewing of subsequent shows. So it serves an important marketing function. So not only is it additive from an economic standpoint, but in fact, it can help drive the viewing for shows that have immediacy. And one of the reasons that windowing is so important is that -- and the focus of our programmers has evolved, is that we need to have the immediacy, the impact of our shows like Jersey Shore, like that new episode of iCarly, that people want to see right now. They don't want to wait for 21 days. And in fact, when they look at the older shows, it can introduce those shows to new audiences that will then look at the shows when they become available on television. Now, the marketplace may evolve, and we will track that as we go forward. The good news is that we are as well-positioned as any one because we understand our audiences, we program for our audiences and, to the extent that broadband distribution becomes a stronger competitor than other forms of distribution, that's good for content. We like competition. It was not a bad thing for us when we moved from a world where there was only one stream of distribution through cable, and now we have at least four streams of distribution with satellite distributors, telcos and now broadband.", "Thomas Dooley", "We've also seen in our research that the older that young person gets when they get married, the likelihood of subscribing to a multi-video provider increases dramatically and then when they have children, it geometrically increases and it is almost 100% at that level. There's very few cord-cutters that have kids. So we see this as sort of a college age phenomena. We don't see it as a big industry trend that people should be all that worried about.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Dix from Wedbush.", "James Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Just two things, I guess following up a little bit, Philippe, on what you've said about how well the studio's positioned. I'm wondering if you could give any additional color as to what you think the profit targets or outlook should be for Paramount that we should be thinking about this year just going forward? And then secondly, I guess, given the research that you do on your demo and how that demo is the most interested in social media, I'm wondering if you have any insight you could give us as to whether you see social media and things like Facebook as friend or foe. Is it something which gives advertisers another reason to come to you as a content provider to interact with your audience? Or is it a potential siphon of brand dollars as that platform gets bigger?", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the studio's concerned, the one thing we do know is we\u2019ve had a lot of good theatrical releases so far in the year, and that will lead to a number of home entertainment releases of those pictures. So we expect, as I mentioned in my remarks, that to unfold in a very good way. We would like the prospects of the remainder of our slate. But obviously, the actual profitability will depend on performance going forward. I can say that we are well-positioned to enjoy solid margins at Paramount compared to where we were last year and the continued improvement in return on invested capital. As far as social media, we view it as friend. We have worked very actively with Facebook, with Twitter. We have very good -- and others. We have good, strong relationships. We drive a lot of traffic to them, and they help enhance our audience\u2019s affinity with our brands and our content. And we work with advertisers. And we point out to advertisers that they can really reach our viewers and the young audiences they covet through our brands, not just in our networks, but through social media. And the social media has been a great driver of some of the ratings on our shows. It just expands the awareness.", "Thomas Dooley", "It increases our level of engagement with the consumer that really helps us drive both ratings and relationships with them, and helps us have a much more compelling product to put forward to advertisers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank", "You gave some color on the international advertising trend. There were some timing issues that make the sequential improvements a little bit difficult to understand. Can you kind of give a normalized picture of what's going on there? And if you strip out the timing issues, what's happening sequentially? And how do you -- how is the international advertising landscape kind of looking right now?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well we got to see improvement, as we mentioned, we expected to see double-digit organic growth in international in the quarter that we are in. We're seeing strength in a number of European countries. We're seeing strength in Latin America. And a lot of it will depend on the strength of individual local markets but also as we get -- we've improved our channel position, we've launched new channels and we are very much focused on improving ad sales as we go forward.", "David Bank", "But, Philippe, the double-digit improvement is in part due to, I think you said there were some timing issues. I guess, the question was, if you adjust out for the timing issues, does the environment look sort of sequentially improving or flattish or...", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, even if you x that out, we'd see organic improvement, x those special factors in ad sales. We see stronger ad market in many of our key markets and a stronger position for many of our key channels in markets, particularly in Europe and Latin America.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

And welcome to this Viacom's Second Quarter Earnings Release Teleconference for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2011. Today's call is being recorded. Now for opening remarks and introductions, I will turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended March 31, which is the second quarter of our fiscal year. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. Let me refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website. ", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner Redstone", "Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you this morning, and I am more than pleased to be joining my Viacom colleagues to report another quarter of truly outstanding results for the company. ", "In the second quarter, Viacom continued to deliver strong, strong growth on all fronts. By every measure, it was an extraordinary performance. Viacom once again set the standard for developing the world's most sought-after creative content by complementing already highly successful brands and continually introducing the most popular new television program and film titles. Now, make no mistake about it. Building this positive momentum in this still challenging economy is not an easy feat. However, Philippe and the Viacom team have taken exactly the right steps to prepare for and recover from the downturn with our laser focus on enhancing efficiency, on building financial strength and on continuing to invest in programs and content development. Thanks to their skill and their dedication, our creative outfit and our operational oversight has never been better. And the beneficiary of all this creativity, this superior institution, this exceptional management are of course Viacom's shareholders. We're seeing the value of their investments grow as the market recognizes and rewards our progress. ", "Today, Viacom is exactly where it needs to be making some of the most talked about television programming  and bringing the most anticipated movies ever screened. The quality of our brands, the creativity of our employees, the expertise of our management are second to none, and I could not be more optimistic about where we are today, more excited about where we will be tomorrow.", "So now I will turn this call over to my very good friend, one of the wisest men I have ever known, Philippe Dauman, our CEO.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us today. This morning, Viacom reported outstanding results from every part of our company. Our momentum, which continues to build, has been fueled by our disciplined focus, our creative resurgence and our consistently strong execution, operationally and financially. The investments we've made in research and programming over the past several years are paying off in the form of strengthened brands and hit programming that are attracting growing audiences in the U.S. and around the globe. This entertainment content is also finding fresh audiences on a growing number of new platforms that carry our content, audiences that our advertising partners find increasingly difficult to reach. As we look ahead to the advertising upfront, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous ratings growth and compelling programming slates we have to offer, particularly on our major networks.", "Paramount Pictures delivered markedly improved results in the quarter, helped in part by the strong film releases across several windows, and our summer blockbusters begin to premiere next weekend. ", "Innovation is a key ingredient to making all of our operations more efficient. New technologies and new ways of thinking about how best to operate in this highly dynamic media environment are changing our approach on everything from customer relationships to marketing campaigns, to content creation for different platforms. Some changes are small, others are substantial, but all are shaping Viacom into a more nimble, more connected and more responsive media company. ", "Today, I will review our financial results and cover the highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail on our performance, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. We will speak to the adjusted numbers during our discussion this morning.", "Viacom's consolidated revenues were $3.27 billion in the second quarter, up 20% driven by strong double-digit growth in both Media Networks and Film  Entertainment. Media Networks' revenues increased 11% on solid growth in advertising, affiliate and ancillary revenues. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generated a 38% rise in revenues with double-digit increases in theatrical, home entertainment, TV licensing and ancillary revenues. ", "Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations grew 69% to $430 million in the March quarter on higher operating and equity income. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.72, up 71% from the $0.42 earned in the prior year. The strength of these results enabled us to accelerate our stock repurchase program, so we could return even greater value to our shareholders. During our second fiscal quarter, we repurchased $500 million in stock, which was $100 million more than we had previously planned. During the current quarter, we are on track to buy back $700 million of stock, and we now expect to complete the majority of our $4 billion buyback program by the end of fiscal 2011 and the remainder, no later than the end of the June quarter in 2012.", "Next month, we will review the current quarterly dividend with our board, and we intend to ask for an increase, which assuming it is approved, would commence with the dividends to be paid on July 1. Viacom has never been stronger financially, and we are generating ample free cash flow to support both an accelerated buyback program and a more generous dividend, while continuing to invest in our business. We believe this is the right step for our shareholders. ", "Now let's move on to the performance of our divisions in the quarter. The results generated by our Media Networks segment improved across nearly every metric. We remain focused on nurturing and fine-tuning our core brands and developing programming that reflects those brand attributes. As a result, our hit ratio is up and our pipeline of development projects is full and still expanding. This work is never complete. Audiences change and we must evolve with them. Driven by our proprietary research, we've done this successfully many times with several of our brands, and we will do so again. Our track record of success makes our network some of the most highly valued brands by distributors and marketers alike across all platforms. And we are firmly committed to getting our content, under appropriate terms and conditions, into the hands of our audiences whenever they want it and wherever they happen to be. ", "So in addition to our long-term partnerships with traditional distributors, we have our own branded websites and apps, and we work with the innovative platforms and tools created by others. With these devices and partnerships, we are engaging our audience on their own terms and forging deeper connections between them and our content. At the same time, we are monetizing our content on these new distribution platforms in ways that provide us with incremental growth. For example, fans love our new relationship with Hulu, and we've made more library content available on Netflix from Nickelodeon, TV Land, MTV, and Comedy Central. ", "We are continuing to expand our portfolio of apps, which allow our audience to experience our content in new ways. One of our most recent offerings is BET's launch of its new 106 & PARK app. This is the first app to fully integrate a realtime mobile user audience with a live TV show, which happens to be the #1 music variety show on cable.", "In addition, our affiliate group continues to expand the availability of next-day, video-on-demand to partners who disabled fast-forward. Last quarter, Verizon FiOS launched MTV's and Nickelodeon's authenticated sites, providing filed subscribers with access to a selection of the channel's most popular current programs, as well as library content. The program offerings will soon be expanded to include content from Comedy Central. ", "Our advertising revenues continue to grow with our worldwide revenues up 12% in the quarter and domestic apps sales rising 11%. Domestic growth was driven by strong upfront volume, as well as strong double-digit scatter premiums. Spending in the Movie category was up significantly, and we continue to be pleased with the growing interest from non-endemic advertisers. For example, we had solid growth in spending from the automotive companies, as well as the insurance and candy categories. ", "All of this was achieved without the benefit of the Kids' Choice Awards. The event and the ad dollars that go with it took place in our fiscal third quarter this year, so we will see the impact of that spending in the June quarter results when we expect to deliver another quarter of sequential improvement in our domestic ad revenue growth rate. ", "Also, our international advertising revenues bounced back this past quarter with a double-digit increase driven primarily by our businesses in the U.K. and Latin America. ", "Let me provide a few observations about the upfront season. First, the kids' upfront. It's under way and the market is robust. Categories such as toys, movies, games and even autos are showing strong interest and actively buy. We expect to build on the progress we made last year in growing our business from adult categories at the kids' upfront. ", "Season to date, Nickelodeon has grown its ratings among adults between 18 to 49 by 3% and its tentpole events such as the Kids' Choice Awards and iCarly and SpongeBob movie events have delivered both broadcast and top tier cable networks in terms of ratings. At this point, we have already sold substantially more volume than we had at the same time in last year's kids' upfront.", "Second, the adult upfront. We are looking forward to significant year-over-year gains in both volume and pricing. At this time last year, we had solid ratings, but we were not in a position to monetize the phenomenal ratings we garnered in recent months, particularly the broadcast size audiences we've delivered for several of our top-rated programs. And now we can. And we intend to do so for future seasons of those shows. ", "Now a few programming highlights from our networks. MTV is hotter than ever. It just closed out its highest-rated quarter in 5 years, growing its audience by 25%. The network's ratings improved in every daypart with the biggest gains in the valuable 10:00-hour where ratings were up 91%. Jersey Shore, MTV's highest-rated series ever, was the #1 series across all television, cable and broadcast with 12- to 34-year-olds. And it ranked #7 among series across all television among adults 18 to 49. Next month, Snooki, The Situation and the rest of the gang head to Florence, Italy to begin filming Season 4.", "MTV's success extends beyond the shore. The network had 2 additional top 10 original cable series with Teen Mom 2 and Real World: Las Vegas. Teen Mom 2's ratings were up 57% over the show's first season. These top 10 hits were joined by the second seasons of My Life As Liz and Hard Times of RJ Berger, both of which are outperforming their first seasons. ", "The audience for Comedy Central continues to grow and Tosh.0 has firmly established itself as another ratings juggernaut for the network. In its third season, Tosh.0's ratings climbed more than 50% among adults and it was the most-watched show during its time slot on all of television among Comedy's key male demos. And Tosh's stand-up special, Daniel Tosh-Happy Thoughts was the highest-rated stand-up premier in Comedy Central history among its core demos.", "But Tosh wasn't doing all the work. The Comedy Central Roast that Donald Trump was its most-watched comedy roast ever among young men. Both The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report delivered ratings growth with Jon firmly positioned as the #1 late-night talk show host with young viewers on all of television. And the network's newest tentpole, The Comedy Awards, reached an unduplicated audience of nearly 17 million viewers, not a bad start.", "Story for Nickelodeon just keeps getting better and better. This network continues to turn out hit after hit, nurturing the existing ones, while developing new entrants. Its newest preschool show Bubble Guppies debuted last quarter and is already the #1 preschool series on TV. Nick boasts 4 of the top 5 preschool series on all of television. Nickelodeon's major live-action shows, iCarly, Big Time Rush and Victorious all delivered strong performances.", "We just greenlit a fifth season of iCarly, which will roll out in 2012. iCarly's recent episode premiere, iOMG, drew 7.4 million viewers, which made it the top telecast with all kid and tween demos on all television and basic cable's top kids' telecast with 12 total viewers. ", "Five of Nick's newest imports, House of Anubis, ranked as the #1 show on TV with kids and tweens in its time period and now fans can look forward to a second season. The network has also enjoyed a strong start with Power Rangers, which is the top-rated show with kids, boys and total viewers in its Sunday time period, as well as a new Supah Ninjas, which  launched a couple of weeks ago. And on Nick at Nite, we're looking forward to the launch of Friends, one of the most popular series of all time, which will begin to air in September. ", "BET celebrates its best quarter ever, that means the best in more than 30 years. Record-breaking hits, THE GAME and Let's Stay Together joined perennial favorites, CELEBRATION OF GOSPEL, BET Honors and Rip the Runway to grow the BET audience by another 5% in the quarter. In its recent upfront presentation, BET announced plans for another original sitcom, Reed Between the Lines starring Malcolm-Jamal Warner  of the Cosby Show fam and Tracee Ellis Ross, formerly of Girlfriends, as well as new seasons for THE GAME and Let's Stay Together. BET will also introduce a new music docu-series called, The Message, which will explore the world of hip-hop music. The network also unveiled plans for several new scripted web originals that will run across all BET digital platforms. ", "Finally, we're continuing our work to reinvigorate VH1 and Spike. At VH1, we are developing several new shows to cultivate a stronger female audience. For example, Mob Wives debuted 2 weeks ago, and is delivering solid ratings. Later next month, we will also launch Single Ladies, a comedy series from Queen Latifah's production company.", "SPIKE's second season of Blue Mountain State is finding its audience with the ratings up 30% over its first season. New shows Auction Hunters and Cool are both performing well. Importantly, we have several new projects in development that will better reflect our key target demos. ", "Our international operations are continuing to make solid progress. Two recent strategic moves have helped to boost our ratings in the key markets of the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., we were able to move MTV to a more widely distributed tier on Sky, which resulted in an 85% lift to the network's ratings. We also reconfigured our channel portfolio in Germany. As a result, the Viva delivered its strongest quarter in more than a year with ratings up 19%. Both Nick and Comedy Central turned in their highest ratings ever in the territory.", "Looking at the rest of the world, MTV's overall ratings were strong with notable gains in Spain, Canada and Australia. Nickelodeon continues to gain share in several territories and expand into new ones. And ratings for Trefis continues to grow, up double digits for the quarter opening up both short and long-term Latino-oriented advertising sales for us. ", "As I've said in the past, we expect our international operations to grow at a faster rate than our domestic businesses and we remain focused on continuing to expand our International operating margins. ", "Now let's move on to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount Pictures delivered strong results across the board in our second quarter. Four months into the calendar year, Paramount is #1 at the domestic box office. The studio's Theatrical results reflected strong performance in a film that opened in the previous quarter as well as our Q2 titles: No Strings Attached, MTV Films' Justin Bieber: Never Say Never and Nickelodeon Movies, Rango. All of these films did well at the box office. And in the case of Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, it now ranks as the #1 concert teen movie of all-time in the U.S. This is supported by a brilliant marketing campaign, and Paramount took a unique step of releasing a second version of the film, the Director's Fan Cut for a 1 week limited release just 2 weeks after the film had opened wide. The Director's Fan Cut included 40 minutes of additional footage. And as expected, the fans turned out for more Bieber.", "The studio also had a strong slate of home entertainment releases in the quarter, 9 in all, which increased our revenues by 38% over the prior year. Next weekend, we premier the first of our many summer blockbusters, Marvel's Thor. We have an incredibly robust slate of films coming out over the next few months. Following Thor will be DreamWorks Animation sequel, Kung Fu Panda 2, J.J. Abrams' Super 8, our threquel spectacular Transformers: Dark of the Moon in 3D and Captain America: The First Avenger, another Marvel film.", "To conclude, every part of Viacom is in great shape. Creatively, we've never been stronger. We will continue to invest in our future by feeding our development pipeline and by continuing to enhance our brands and franchise properties. Operating efficiently is now our modus operandi and it's another area that requires tremendous vigilance but the benefits are recognized by all. We will continue to return significant capital to our shareholders. We have a tremendously talented team working hard throughout this company and their collective contributions will help us to maximize the opportunities ahead for Viacom.  ", "And now I'll turn it over to Jimmy.", "James Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter, which is the second quarter of our fiscal year. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results exclude from this year's March quarter, the charge associated with the tender offer of our 6.25% senior notes, which was $87 million on a pretax basis and $54 million after tax. ", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks' revenues increased 11% to $2.1 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 10% and International revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 2 percentage point favorable impact on International revenues. Page 9 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues grew 11% in the quarter. International advertising increased 19% with foreign exchange improving the growth rate by 2 percentage points. International ad sales in the quarter benefited from strong ad markets in both Europe and Latin America and from new program launches, as well as improved channel positions in the U.K..", "In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 9%, while international revenues increased 6%. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the international growth rate by 2 percentage points. Approximately 80% of the growth in domestic affiliate revenues was from rate increases with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. Internationally, growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate increases, new channel launches, as well as increased subscribers.", "Now moving to ancillary revenues. Worldwide ancillary revenues increased 10% in the quarter, principally reflecting higher TV syndication and consumer product revenues. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $806 million in the quarter was 13% higher than last year. The operating margin of 39% improved 70 basis points over the prior year. The improvement in the margin was driven by strong top line growth, partially offset by a 9% growth in total expenses. Within expenses, programming expenses grew 8%, while SG&A expense grew 12%. ", "The growth in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher advertising and promotion expenses and, to a lesser degree, increased accrued compensation expenses. The increase in advertising and promotion expense, related to the launch of new and returning series, which contributed to our strong ratings success in the quarter, as well as to the marketing of new channel positions and certain international territories. The increase in accrued compensation expenses related to higher operating profit and ad sales.", "Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 38% to $1.2 billion. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide, Theatrical revenues increased 50% to just over $400 million in the quarter. The Theatrical results benefited from strong carryover revenues from our December quarter releases as well as the performance of the current quarter's slate of Rango, Justin Bieber's Never Say Never and No Strings Attached. ", "Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues increased 38% to $410 million. The increase reflects a greater number of Home Entertainment releases in the current quarter as we released 9 titles compared to 1 title in the March quarter of last year. TV license fees increased 30% to $336 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter was principally due to higher network TV and syndication revenues. Overall, Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $39 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $83 million last year. This $122 million improvement in operating income principally reflects the performance of our Home Entertainment releases in the quarter as well as the growth of TV license fees. ", "During the quarter, certain Paramount releases were made available to our EPIX pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, Filmed Entertainment recognized $20 million of revenues and $2 million of operating income in the quarter related to these releases.", "Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $15 million in the quarter. The income principally relates to our investment in EPIX. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, reflecting 170 basis point improvement over the prior year rate. Reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an improved international versus domestic mix of taxable income from our operations. ", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'm also going to talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our 2011 fiscal year. ", "For the quarter, we generated $812 million in operating free cash flow compared to $351 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher operating income, a favorable working capital variance and lower cash taxes. The favorable working capital variance was impacted by the timing of annual incentive compensation payments related to the change in our fiscal year end. And these payments were made in the December quarter of this year whereas last year, they were made in the March quarter. ", "As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of 5.8%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter. ", "During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to improve our debt maturity profile, as well as the issue incremental debt. We successfully tendered for $582 million of our 6.25% senior notes that are due in 2016. That leaves $918 million of that series of notes outstanding. In conjunction with the tender, we issued $500 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2021. By doing this, we pushed out a portion of the debt that was coming due in 2016, improving our maturity profile at attractive rates. In addition, given the current level of rates in our earnings growth, we issued an incremental $500 million of 3.5% senior notes that are due in 2017.", "In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.2 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding, and we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which reflects excess operating cash and the proceeds from our recent bond issuance. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.96x, which is below our target level. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of our quarter, our interest coverage ratio was 9x. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, between our buyback and dividend programs, for the first 6 months of our fiscal year, we have returned a total of $1.1 billion of capital back to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter. So for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.9 billion to our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2011. In terms of advertising, the scatter market remains strong and we have had ratings success at a number of our core channels. In addition, in the June quarter, we will have a couple of timing benefits, the Kids' Choice Awards on April 2 of this year whereas it aired in March of last year. Also, Easter fell later in April of this year. Accordingly, as Philippe mentioned, in the June quarter, we anticipate that we will have sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth rate. We also anticipate that international ad sales will grow double digits as we continue to see strength in Europe and Latin America. ", "At Media Networks, at this point in the year, we have a fair amount of clarity on our programming expense growth, and we expect it to grow in the range of 7.5% to 8% for the full year. As we look from now to the end of the year, we continue to see opportunities to grow our margins.", "Given our current estimate of our domestic versus international profitability mix, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 35% for the fiscal year 2011. We are in great shape as we head into the back half of the year. At Media Networks, we've had breakout ratings performance for several new and returning series that we have launched. We are seeing stronger volumes in several key advertising categories, including strength in studio spending with a number of summer films releases targeting kids and young adults. We have also made progress in growing several non-endemic categories. ", "At Paramount, we are looking forward to our summer slate with the June 10 release of the J.J. Abrams directed Super 8 and the July 1 release of Transformers 3 in 3D. In addition, we are distributing Marvel's Thor and Captain America, as well as DreamWorks Animation, Kung Fu Panda 2.", "Looking ahead at the studio releases, we are looking forward to sequels to Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe and Paranormal franchises, as well as Madagascar 3 and Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson's Adventures of Tintin, a remake of the movie, Footloose, under the MTV Films label and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which will star Jeremy Renner.", "In terms of free cash flow, in the back half of the year, we anticipate generating higher operating free cash flow than the comparable period in the prior year, with cash flow being weighted largely to the September quarter. The timing of P&A cash spend and participation payments will impact the June quarter, while the September quarter will benefit from theatrical receipts on our summer releases, including Transformers 3. Given the growth in earnings that we see as we progress throughout the year, we now anticipate purchasing an excess of $2 billion of our stock in fiscal 2011.", "In summary, the strategic initiatives that we have put in place over the past couple of years and the capital allocation decisions we have made are paying off and putting Viacom on a path towards strong top and bottom line growth. At Media Networks, our focus on research and understanding our audiences as well as our investment in original programming is translating into improved ratings and advertising growth. And our cost discipline has enabled us to improve our core margins for the last 8 quarters. ", "At the studio, we continue to develop and grow our slate of franchise film, and Paramount is a leader when it comes to developing innovative marketing campaigns. We are managing the business with financial discipline, reducing our overhead and improving return on invested capital. We are focused on growing our businesses organically and using our free cash flow and the incremental capacity generated from our balance sheet to return capital to our shareholders.", "I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Michael Nathanson of Nomura Securities.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "I have a couple. One is, you've all said, all 3 of you said that Europe has been strong for you, and you mentioned a couple of things that you've done differently in Europe on the advertising side. And I wonder, we have been hearing reports that Europe advertising is actually getting softer. So can you tell us if you think the changes that you've done are helping you take share? Or is the market more better for cable nets and broadcasting? So a little bit more on the kind of the undercurrent within Europe, and whether or not there's a share gain in store for you. And then I have one on the U.S.?", "Philippe Dauman", "Michael, the European strength has been largely driven by improved ratings in our key territories. As I've mentioned, the U.K. MTV ratings are gangbusters. I mean they've practically doubled in the last few months since we made the change in positioning of the channel. Similarly, we made some changes in Germany, which is an important territory, which has boosted our ratings. And both of those are translating into higher ad sales. But we're also seeing strength in various countries like Poland and countries in Southern Europe. So we're experiencing good growth, which is continuing into this quarter. And Latin America has been a very strong part of the world for us as well. You have a second question, Mike?", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "Yes, second question being, in the past, I know you've sold lighter networks for MTV run or  schedule. You mentioned that you're looking for this upfront. Can you talk a bit about how maybe selling show by show or time period could actually -- what impact would that have on your ability to get on to CPMs and volume. So can you talk about that, Tom? I know some of you guys have focused on.", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, I think overall, we're looking -- we're delivering ratings that are equivalent, better. We're better than some of the broadcast ratings on critical nights. Thursday night is one of our strongest nights. We're delivering one of the sweetest audiences that you can get out there so we're looking for pricing, and we are modifying some of the ways we sell and working with advertisers and innovative ways to package our advertising portfolio to get the most value out of it for us and provide the most value to the advertisers who want to buy into those shows. So we are shifting it around. We haven't dramatically changed the way we sell, but we are working with different advertisers in different ways to maximize revenues for us and the benefit for them.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "Hey, at this point I'm just trying to figure out what can go wrong Philippe. So I'm curious on your philosophy and budgeting regarding cost. When revenue comes in better than expected and companies have success with their investment spending as you've had with your programming spending, the next thing we often see is the view that investment spending should accelerate, right? The more of a good thing philosophy that we like to call cost creep. So as you look at your budgets the rest of the year and start thinking about next year, is the philosophy on spending changing at all?", "Philippe Dauman", "Doug, no. We believe in investing in what drives our business, which is the research and programming. So our target, as we look forward into next year, is to continue to grow programming spend in the mid-single-digit territory. In other areas of cost, we continue to look for efficiencies. That's both domestically and internationally, and in our Film division, as well as our Networks division. We're watching for headcount creep. That doesn't mean that we don't hire people, but we want to make sure we hire people for the right evolution of the marketplace as technologies and distribution platforms evolve, and just keep good controls to run our business. So we do pride ourselves on continuing to drive efficiency as we go forward.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.", "Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just a question on U.S. advertising. Some participants in the market have mentioned that CPG and food advertising was a little bit weak in March. Was that something that you guys saw, particularly at Nickelodeon where you have a lot of exposure to that? And I have one follow-up.", "Thomas Dooley", "Drew, advertising in Nickelodeon and advertising demand is really exceptionally strong. The endemic categories are very strong and toys are strong. There are many, many films that are coming out this summer to address the family audience, which is very good for us. And as we mentioned in our remarks, the non-endemic category growth has been accelerating. So now in the overall marketplace, we continue to see some very strong scatter demand. Obviously, there's some pockets or individual companies. We're looking at the environment more cautiously based on their individual circumstances. But what we're seeing is that their competitors are stepping in to grab market share. So we really have seen continued strength in the marketplace  as we are positioning ourselves for the upfront discussions.", "Drew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's really helpful. And then just shifting gears to international. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the margins that you had in international in the first quarter? Obviously, we could see that total Media Networks margins improved in the quarter. How much of that was attributable to the international side? And could you just reiterate what sort of your near-term objectives are for getting margins up internationally over the next 12 months?", "James Barge", "Well, international margins are continuing to improve both, and that's both a result of good vitality and advertising growth that we're seeing now looking at efficiency as we go forward. On a full year basis, we expect our international margins to grow in this year into the low teens territory or low to mid-teens territory. And as we go forward, over the next 2 to 3 years, we are well on track to grow our international margins to the 20%-plus territory, which is our near-term objective.", "Thomas Dooley", "And while the international margins improved on a year-over-year basis, Drew, because of the magnitude of the numbers, they provided a little bit of lift, but not much lift on the overall margin improvement.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "First one for Jimmy or Tom. Question's on Netflix and Hulu dollars into the consolidated model. I think that you have Hulu dollars coming in that are split between your affiliate and advertising lines in the Media Networks segment. And so I'm just wondering is there any way that you can get more granular on how Hulu and Netflix dollars I think you have library content dollars coming into ancillary, but it's just hard for us to model it without any sort of guidance on order of magnitude. And then I have a follow-up for Philippe.", "Thomas Dooley", "Yes, Anthony. Right now, the magnitude is not that significant so we're not going to break it out. It is benefiting advertising and ancillary at this point in time. As it becomes more significant, we will give some color on how it's impacting the thing. But at this point in time, it's just that not significant to break out. But next quarter and the quarter after that, as those numbers become more significant, we'll give some more color on that.", "Anthony DiClemente - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and just along that theme for Philippe, can you just talk about your level of focus on potential future broadband deals be it with Facebook or other broadband platforms in addition to your current agreements with Netflix and Hulu?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, I think we're very focused on gaining our content out there. By the way, around the world, there's a lot of opportunity on a global scale right now. And as you know, Netflix has expanded into Canada. It's the first territory, and we recently announced a Paramount deal in the pay window. With Netflix in Canada and it's looking at other foreign territories, there a number of players in different parts of the world. And domestically, there is a growing interest by the number of players in our content, as well as other media companies' content. But we are in discussions with many of those players, and you can expect over time more licensing agreements. We obviously want to wait to make sure that we get the right value in the right terms and make sure that the revenues that we are repaying are largely incremental. So we're pleased with the deals that we've made so far this year. There are more to come, and you will see the revenues and profitability accelerate as quarters go forward.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Barton Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "I wanted to ask for a little bit more discussion of the ad trend, the change in March over December domestically, an improvement to 11% from 10%. It was nice to see a 1 percentage point. But with the audience strength, we might have expected a bit more. And I was wondering if you could talk about why we couldn't see more acceleration. Perhaps you could quantify the Kids' Choice impact. Also talk about maybe the delay in being able to fully monetize some of the audience gains you've had.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, first of all, we're pleased that we continue to I believe it's the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential domestic ad growth improvement. So we are in a mode right now of continuous improvement. We sold -- as I mentioned, a good strong portion of our inventory was sold in the upfront. And that we cannot get the benefit of higher ratings in some of our shows as to that inventory. So it's been limited to our scatter pricing. The Kids' Choice Awards shift accounted for close to 200 basis points, the shift from 1 quarter to the next, so that's really a factor. And then we are working on the improvement and they've stabilized so far. The ratings of Spike and VH1, so that's an increasing opportunity for us as we go forward as our major brands continue to build on their strength. So we're very much looking forward not just to continued strength in the scatter market as this year continues but a really great opportunity for us as we're able to get a lift in the upfront volume and pricing for the next year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Richard Greenfield, BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "I just was curious at one point on DreamWorks Animation. I think on their conference call the other day, they made the comment that they don't expect any update on The Situation until potentially as much as a year from now. And we're just thinking in terms of how you think about dating your films and the release slots that they occupy. Can you actually wait a year to make this decision? Or do you actually have a sense of this a lot sooner than that in terms of slotting your own films especially with your slate seeming to be improving pretty dramatically? And then two, on Spike and VH1, I was just hoping Philippe I heard what you just said, could you just elaborate a little bit? It seems like those are still drags on your overall growth. And how much opportunity do you see over the next year? How much new programming? What are the things we should be looking for in terms of a major content that's coming to each of those networks to really move the needle to get them to where you've seen some of your other networks like BET and MTV really improve year-over-year?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Richard. As far as DreamWorks Animation, our studio is working very hard and looking forward to the upcoming release of Kung Fu Panda 2. We also have later in the calendar year at the beginning of our next fiscal year Puss in Boots, which will also be a big title. We have a strong relationship with DreamWorks Animation. It's a multifaceted relationship. Our networks, notably the Nickelodeon family of networks, have been enthusiastic supporters of the film releases, as well as the Penguin shows we air in Nickelodeon, and we have an upcoming Kung Fu Panda 2 we show in Nickelodeon. So we value the relationship, and I know Jeffrey values the relationship as well. As you point out, our development pipeline is strong. We have many franchises, and we're very pleased with the strategic direction of the studio. We also have picked up some additional distribution opportunities notably the Martin Scorsese movie, Hugo Cabret, which we are, a 3D movie we're distributing at Thanksgiving. And there are more distribution opportunities emerging. So it's really -- we'd be pleased to extend the relationship. We think that we can accommodate it, but that's not until 2013. We will be distributing 2 DreamWorks Animation films in 2012. And we sure we will both do well, in the one scenario or another. So we'll be happy to entertain discussions when Jeffrey feels it's appropriate. I'm sorry?", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "There's no specific timeframe that you're looking for that you need to make a decision?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we plan our own strategy.  We obviously start beginning to plan our 2013 and '14 release slates, and we can accommodate having the DreamWorks titles in or out. And it's really -- it'll really be up to DreamWorks Animation's to make the decisions that it feels it's appropriate for itself. As to a Spike and VH1, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made, the work, the research work and development of the brand direction has -- it's very well advanced so that we now have our development pipeline functioning through the brand filter with a strong focus on women for VH1. I mentioned some of the shows that have just launched that we have many more shows coming. The ratings, which are down year-on-year, have stabilized. And I expect we'll see improvement as the year progresses and we believe we have a good story to tell our advertisers in terms of the program direction of new shows coming into pipeline there, as well as for Spike. I'm very pleased that we're increasing the level of original programming that we have at Spike. Spike was actually a network that had very little original programming. And well, you will see over the next year or 2 a very significant increase. And  that's been the driver of improvement at some of the other network turnarounds that you're seeing.", "Thomas Dooley", "And like all the networks, Rich, it's a couple of shows that develop strong and positive ratings growth. That builds momentum. That's a great promotion vehicle and that's how those networks build upon their own success. The good news is that the audiences that Spike and VH1 and the shows that we put on there are right in the core audiences that we want to attract back to the network. So it's a good initial start in bringing those people back to the networks. And the momentum there is something we feel very positive about.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "And Philippe, can you talk about a substantial increase in programming expenses, is that being offset by scaling back the purchased syndicated programming? Or is it an overall big step-up for those 2 in overall expenditures?", "Philippe Dauman", "I think in general, across our networks, obviously we apply, we target mid-single digit increase in our programming investment. Yes, that's not applied uniformly across our networks, that's a blended average. But the direction that we're going in is to shift some dollars that we spend for acquired programming into some of this original programming. In today's environment, our audiences are looking for fresh original programming and less programming they've seen before or can find anywhere else on the dial. And we also believe that original programming serves our brands better and more distinctive and associated with our brands, and we are very much focused on continuing to grow the strength of our brands generally, again both in the U.S. and around the world.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Most of the excess cash seems to be going to buybacks. So I'm just wondering are there areas that you are interested in making acquisitions? And are there, as part of that question, are there opportunities for new channel launches? You seem to have done extremely well in India. Can you add more channels there or in other areas? And is that included -- when you talk about the margin outlook for international, is that contemplated?", "Philippe Dauman", "Jessica, we're very much focused on organic growth. We see a lot of opportunity to grow our brands. While we do make some modest acquisitions, they are far and few between and low in price. We are talking about the international arena, we have the opportunities to expand many, many of our brands that we already own. India has been a very good and interesting market for us. That is a joint venture, as you know. So it appears in our equity line and the callers channel we launched there continues to be very successful. Our MTV, Nick and VH1 channels are successful. And yes, we are looking to launch additional channels in India. We see some opportunities there. Our joint venture owns an Indian film studio, so you can expect for us to look at opportunities to launch a film channel and other channels in India. In general, over the long term, some of the significant emerging markets present very interesting opportunities for our brands, and that will fuel our growing asset value outside of the U.S.", "Thomas Dooley", "But in terms of capital allocation, Jessica, those new channels would not be significant investments given the scale of Viacom.", "Jessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And can I just ask one Paramount more question. With  Marvel distribution rolling off and it sounds like you're adding others, are there better ways that you can scale Paramount's overhead? I mean is there a plan to increase your own production?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, as we come off deals like Marvel, we have our own franchises kicking in. And Tom mentioned a number of them in his remarks. But it's actually a question about overhead. We are continuing to improve our overhead structure. We are reducing the overhead expense at Paramount. We are looking for opportunities to get efficiencies and partnerships or otherwise in several international markets. We've been able to do that in a few territories, and we're in discussions in other territories. So we are driving continuing improvement in overhead. At the same time, we are looking to benefit from our own franchises as, for example, the Marvel deal rolls off.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Andrew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Philippe, I wonder if you could comment on the Home Entertainment performance. It was quite strong. And if you separate the performance of the new releases, how did the business perform? And I would just like to get your thoughts on the overall market? And then I would like a comment on the strategy around CG animated films? And are there any plans to sequel  Rango given the success that you had with that film?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, Drew. In general, the Home Entertainment market, the DVD marketplace, used to be soft particularly for catalog title. The titles that do better are the franchise titles, the family entertainment, and that is our overall film strategy. So we are playing in an area of home entertainment strength. I don't expect that on an overall basis, the DVD market will strengthen from here, but I do expect that you will see a growth in the digital streams. And as we go through that transition, we think we'll get a good place again, especially for the kinds of titles that we are producing. As far as animation, we are pleased with our first entry there. We are looking to develop our animated business with the Nickelodeon movie brand. We have some opportunities with some of the franchises that we already have on Nickelodeon's slot, and we're looking for original story ideas. So over time, this will be an area that we will develop at Paramount, and it will fit in well with our strategy of growing our brands, in this case, the Nickelodeon brand.", "Operator", "Our final question today, will come from Michael Morris with Davenport.", "Michael Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC", "Two questions on areas that seem to be potential opportunities, one on the international network business. Affiliate growth remains low, and I know you said that's the business that you think can grow at or above domestic. So can you talk about the outlook for the affiliate growth profile there and whether or not that has potential to accelerate? And then over on the Film business, great revenue quarter. Margins are still somewhat low around 3%. What's the outlook? You just talked a little bit about being able to rationalize the cost going forward continuing on that. But what's the outlook for where those margins ultimately can get to? Can it get up high single digits or up towards industry average?", "Philippe Dauman", "Michael, the international affiliate fees are growing. They're growing at a lower rate at this point, The domestic fees as we -- there are many countries where affiliate fees are not available, so that dampens the growth. But as we develop and as we focus more and more on the opportunities out there that this is one of the areas that we are focusing on, and by the way, I'm personally focusing on. And so over time, we expect not just advertising fees but affiliate fees to grow internationally as we expand our footprint. As far as the Film business margins, I'll let Tom get that up.", "Thomas Dooley", "The Film business, obviously one of the big drivers of the margin and that's the success of the films in the quarter. You'll see the Film business margin improve dramatically towards the back half of the year. And as we've been showing year after year after year, you have to look at this business on at least a trailing-4-quarter basis to get a sense of the progress we've made. But we've taken it up over the last several years and as we look forward, we're going to try and get 5% to 6% margins and then move from 5% and 6% margins over the next several years to the higher margins, the higher single-digit margins. But the caveat of that is going to be a function of those movies being profitable movies that we released. As I've mentioned in the comments, the lineup of franchise features, which for us have tended to be highly profitable feature films -- we would at iCarly, that type of margin growth would be release of those kinds of films as we move forward. So we're optimistic that we can get there, but the films have to be successful.", "Philippe Dauman", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

We continue to prove that we have the right strategy, the best possible management team for executing our plans. Our Media Networks are creating hit after hit, sought after by both audiences and advertisers and Paramount Pictures is putting together a truly unprecedented year of broad profits as shown. Viacom has found its stride, fueled by creativity, discipline and vision and expertise. Each day provides new opportunities to deliver additional value to our investors, which gives me great confidence that Viacom's string of successes are still years and years and years ahead of us. Now I would like to turn the call over to my close friend and colleague, Philippe, about whom I've previously said is one of the wisest, if not the wisest man, I have ever met in my life. Philippe?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you so much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us today. There is no question that Viacom is at the top of its game and we're pushing the bar higher. From a creative standpoint, we are developing more original programming for our Media Networks and our branded digital properties than ever before, all driven by the research we performed to ensure that we know and we understand our audiences better than anyone else. These efforts are fueling our growth in the U.S. and around the world. Many of our most successful programs in the U.S. have grown into regional and even global hits, and we are continuing to develop new brands and properties in international markets that can be introduced in a variety of countries around the world including the U.S. These creative successes continue to attract new marketing partners who want to reach the engaged audience as we deliver. ", "At our film studio, Paramount Pictures, we remain focused on developing strategic film slates based on a foundation of proven franchises and branded films. This approach is working, and will continue to be a valuable guide as we expand into the animation genre. Throughout the company, we also continue to drive greater operating efficiencies, work that will continue into the future so we can invest more of our resources in the content that appears on all of our screens and improve our margins. ", "This morning, I will review our financial results briefly as well as a few highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail in our performance, and then, we'll be happy to take your questions. We will speak to the adjusted numbers during our discussion this morning.", "Consolidated revenues were $3.77 million in the third quarter, up 15% driven by double-digit revenue growth in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. Media Networks revenues increased 16% on solid growth in advertising, affiliate and ancillary revenue. Filmed Entertainment revenues grew 13%, principally driven by double-digit increases in TV licensing and home entertainment revenue. Viacom's adjusted net earnings for continuing operations grew 35% to $583 million in the June quarter on higher operating and equity income. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.99, up 39% from the $0.71 earned in the prior year. ", "During the quarter, we announced a substantial increase in our quarterly dividend, up 67% to $0.25 per share. This action was taken in addition to our stock buyback program. Consistent with what I said during our last call, we purchased $700 million in stock in the June quarter and we intend to buy back another $900 million in this quarter for a total of $2.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2011. The pace of our buyback reflects Viacom's strong free cash flow and our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders while also investing in the long-term growth of our business. ", "Now let's talk about how our divisions performed during the quarter. Our Media Networks are thriving. Our decision to increase our investment in original programming is continuing to bear fruit. Across the board, our networks have introduced a multitude of hits and there are many more in various stages of development. This creative journey is leading to more program sharing among our networks and it is helping to fuel our expansion in international markets. As a result, our base of marketing partners is also expanding, which in turn is translating into higher advertising revenues. This quarter, our ad revenues were up 14% worldwide and 12% in the U.S. Our domestic ad sales benefited from solid increases in scattered demand as well as double-digit growth in scatter pricing. While there were notable spending increases in several categories such as movies, toys and autos, the growth was fairly widespread. During the quarter, we saw year-over-year spending growth in more than 20 different categories. Looking ahead, we are targeting double-digit growth in domestic ad revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter. ", "In October, we'll begin our new fiscal year and begin to reap the benefits of the strong upfront completed in June. We added the upfront season with strong ratings and impressive portfolio of programming slates, and the market responded. During the past quarter, we continue to expand the reach of our content through traditional and emerging platform partners. Our domestic affiliate revenues reflect a substantial front from the expansion of incremental revenue associated with new and renewed digital distribution agreements, which involve library content across our networks. These digital deals come with very high margins, and fortunately for us, there was a lot more room for incremental growth from these types of deals both in the U.S. and internationally. We are talking with a number of new partners who are entering the digital distribution arena by making a long-form and short-form content available on their emerging platforms. As a result of these new deals, we have set a new higher base for affiliate revenues this year and we expect to continue to increase those revenues from this higher base and a high single to low double-digit annual rate every year for the foreseeable future.", "On the traditional side, we continue to expand the availability of our networks in HD, which is increasingly important as audiences tend to spend more time within the HD neighborhood. And as I have mentioned in prior calls, we are also responding to affiliate interest in bringing some of our international channels to the U.S. This month, AT&T will launch Africa COLORS, our Indian Channel and MTV Arabia. The total day ratings at a few of our networks add somewhat in the quarter but there were significant programming highlights across the board. Particularly noteworthy is the expanded world of scripted programming is playing the growing success of several of our networks, including MTV; BET; TV Land; and most recently, VH1. ", "At MTV, what really stands out is its depth of strong programming. Even without Jersey Shore on air, MTV's ratings increased year-on-year, and it was again the #1 full day ad support cable network in its target demographic. The network aired 7 different series of specials that averaged a 1.0 rating or higher, and MTV was home to 4 of the top 5 cable telecast in the quarter, excluding sports. This quarter, MTV will debut 6 new series and bring back 5 proven winners, including last night's tremendous premier of Jersey Shore Season 4 from Italy. ", "At Comedy Central, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and the Colbert Report once again ranked as the 2 most watched late night talk shows among young men, and The Daily Show topped all of its competitors among the key audience of the adults 18 to 49. In addition to South Park and the continuing growth of Tosh.0, Comedy also had the best original series launch on cable this year among its core male audience with Workaholics, which has already been picked up for its second season.", "Nickelodeon continues to be the top-rated cable network amongst kids and total viewers for the 65th consecutive quarter, a record no network has come close to. In the U.S., Nickelodeon has 4 of the top 5 preschool series on TV, cable's top 3 animated series and 3 huge live-action hits whose stars are casts Miranda Cosgrove of iCarly, Big Time Rush and, Victoria Justice of Victorious all have released music albums. ", "In fiscal 2012, Nickelodeon will launch 500 new episodes of programming. It will also continue to expand its retail presence. Over the past year, Nick has acquired the rights to select properties that each posses strong potential for consumer products growth, including Winx Club for young girls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for boys and Beatrix Potter for the preschool set. ", "Across our networks, the hits keep growing. BET celebrated this year's BET Awards with 7.7 million viewers, making it the #1 award show on cable year-to-date among adults 18 to 49. Capitalizing on the fact that African-Americans are more active in social network than the general population, BET found the wave of social media buzz in anticipation of the big event. For premiere telecast, BET captured 9 of the top 10 trending topics worldwide on Twitter and it there were 7.5 million BET-Awards-related tweets on the day of the show. As a result, social media tracker trender ranked BET as the most social cable network for the month of June. ", "TV Land has another hit on its schedule with Happily Divorced, which has delivered solid ratings in its freshman season. This latest program joined Hot in Cleveland and Retired at 35, both of which were recognized with Emmy nominations.", "VH1, which has continued to refine its brand filter and programming slate, launched 2 new hits last quarter. Mob Wives found its audience quickly, and the show has already picked up for a second season and Single Ladies, an original comedy series, is facing as VH1's highest-rated new show in 2 years and the network's highest-rated scripted series ever. These shows have fueled a resurgence in VH1's audience, which in the first 5 weeks of the current quarter, has grown 6% over the prior year period. Incidentally, Spike has also grown its audience during the first 5 weeks of the quarter by 8% over last year's comparable period fueled by Auction Hunters and Repo Games.", "As I mentioned upfront, all this programming success is helping us to expand our international footprint. One example is House of Anubis, which originated in the Netherlands and is the first Nickelodeon series to be filmed overseas. After generating strong ratings in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, where it was the #1 live-action show among kids, House of Anubis is now gearing up for a second season. ", "I'll remind you that we own the large majority of our programming, which allows us to introduce audiences around the globe for Jersey Shore, Hot in Cleveland and even SpongeBob home in Bikini Bottom in a very cost-effective way. Ownership also allows us to take a proven concept such as Jersey Shore and localize it for a new audience. Over the last several weeks, Geordie Shore on MTV U.K. has been the highest-rated show in the channel's history. ", "And we're taking a new approach in our expansion of BET International. We have introduced a block of BET programming on nearly 30 different MTV channels worldwide, reaching nearly 160 million households. This move is allowing us to change the perception of BET as the niche brand in the eyes of our audience and will put up new opportunities for growth. Last month, we launched a new brand, Viacom Blink, the new premium entertainment brand for women in Poland. We intend to use Viacom Blink to capture more of the adult audience and the ad revenue that follows. We are looking forward to rolling it out into new markets over time.", "Now let's move on to Filmed Entertainment. The combination of great content, innovative marketing and an increasingly efficient operation is generating the right results at Paramount Pictures. The studio currently ranks #1 in its domestic box office and it again was the first studio to cross the $1 billion threshold in domestic box office in 2011. Earlier this week, we announced the Paramount had surpassed $2 billion at the international box office, 5 months earlier than its prior record for this feat. Paramount has delivered an industry record 6 $100 million domestic box office hits in a row and it is on track to deliver record box office results for the year both domestic and foreign.", "The strong performance of last quarter's releases, Marvel's Thor, DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2, J.J. Abrams Super 8 and the global sensation, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, will help to drive our home entertainment revenues later in the calendar year. Transformers, which set box office records over the July 4 holiday weekend and has already grossed over $1 billion globally, was released at the end of the quarter, so we will see the lion's share of that film's theatrical revenue in our fiscal fourth quarter results. The movies debuted in China shattered box office records by a wide margin generating more than $40 million in receipts in its opening weekend, nearly 80% more than the previous opening mark in that country.", "Paramount also had a strong slate of home entertainment releases in the quarter, which increased our revenues by 33% over the prior year. We're currently enjoying the strong performance of Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we're going to have a great finish to the year with MTV Films' Footloose; the third installment of Paranormal Activity; DreamWorks Animation's Puss in Boots; Martin Scorsese's Hugo; the highly anticipated Mission:  Impossible The Ghost Protocol; and Steven Spielberg The Adventures of Tintin, which will be distributed under the Nickelodeon Movies label. ", "Finally, I want to note our announcement last month that Paramount is launching its own animation division. First off, the timing is right for this move. The studio's is in great shape with a very focused strategy, a renewed level of fiscal discipline and abundant created vigor. Paramount animation will produce high-quality family CGI animated films with budgets of up to $100 million per picture. The Nickelodeon Movies label and its intellectual property will play a key role and we intend to capitalize on merchandising opportunities tied to all Paramount Animation releases. The first film in this division is currently planned for 2014. ", "In conclusion, Viacom's creative firepower is producing more original programming than ever before and a distinctive lineup of films, and that content is invigorating our brands and resonating with audiences around the globe. We will continue to capitalize on the evolving digital landscape and growing international media opportunities to find new ways to monetize our brands and our content. At the same time, we will continue to adapt our organization to take advantage of the evolving content creation, distribution and marketing models. Creativity, focus, discipline and resourcefulness, this is how we will grow and how we will fulfill our commitment to return substantial capital to our shareholders. ", "Now I will turn it over to Jimmy.", "James Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our June quarter, which is the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results exclude $14 million of onetime items from this year's June quarter. ", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. Media Networks revenues increased 16% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 14% and international revenues increased 27% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 10 percentage point favorable impact on international revenues. Page 9 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenue grew 12% in the quarter. International advertising increased 30% with foreign exchange improving the growth rate by 12 percentage points. International ad sales benefited from strength in Europe and Latin America as well as from integrated marketing events in the quarter. In terms of affiliate revenues, our domestic revenues increased 20%, while international revenues increased 16%. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the international growth rate by 9 percentage points. ", "The growth in domestic affiliate fees was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreements as well as by rate increases from traditional distributors. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Approximately 75% of this growth was from rate increases with the remainder driven by an increase in subscribers. International affiliate growth for the quarter was driven by a combination of rate increases and increased subscribers.", "Now moving to ancillary revenues. Worldwide ancillary revenues increased 13% in the quarter, principally reflecting higher consumer product revenues, partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues. Media Networks adjusted operating income of over $1 billion in the quarter was 27% higher than last year. The operating margin of 43% improved 390 basis points over the prior year. The improvement in the margin was driven by top line growth of 16%, partially offset by 8% growth in total expenses. ", "Within expenses, programming expense grew 7% while SG&A expense grew 14%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the growth rate for programming expense by 2 percentage points and the growth rate for SG&A expense by 3 percentage points. The growth in SG&A expense in the quarter was due to higher advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new and returning original series and specials, as well as increased accrued compensation expense, primarily due to stronger operating performance.", "Now turning to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 13% to $1.4 billion. Page 11 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues declined 9% to $588 million in the quarter. As Philippe mentioned, we continue to extend the strength of our film slate, releasing 4 solid titles in the quarter, each of which has gone on to exceed $100 million in domestic box office. Revenues from the current quarter's slate exceeded those from last year's June quarter slate. However, this performance was more than offset by the benefit from carryover revenues in the prior year's quarter. The current quarter slate included Super 8, Kung Fu Panda 2, Thor as well as Transformers 3, which was released at the end of June. While the prior year's carryover revenues benefited from How To Train Your Dragon. Worldwide home entertainment revenues increased 33% to $331 million. The increase primarily reflects the performance and number of our current quarter releases as well as carryover revenues from titles released earlier in the year. Releases during the quarter, included True Grit, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never and No Strings Attached. ", "TV license fees increased 36% to $416 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter was due to higher pay TV, foreign syndication and network TV revenues. Ancillary revenues increased 57% to $72 million, primarily due to higher digital revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $49 million in the quarter as compared to income of $69 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects lower theatrical result, which were impacted by the timing of theatrical releases and P&A spend, including the late June release of Transformers 3. The decline was partially offset by higher profits in home entertainment of revenues and TV license fees. ", "During the quarter, certain Paramount releases were made available to Epix pay-TV joint venture. Accordingly, Filmed Entertainment recognized $15 million of revenue and $7 million of operating income in the quarter related to these releases.", "Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $13 million in the quarter, the increase related to higher incentive compensation cost as a result of our improved operating results and the appreciation of our stock price. Moving below operating income, total company equity income from investments was $12 million in the quarter. The majority of the income relates to our investment in EPIX.", "And our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 35%, reflecting 160-basis-point improvement over the prior year adjusted rate. The reduction in effective tax rate is primarily driven by an improved international versus domestic mix of income from our operations. ", "Now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. ", "In the quarter, we generated $369 million in operating free cash flow in the June quarter, compared to the $370 million that we generated last year. Page 5 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. Higher operating income was offset by higher working capital utilization related to the timing of theatrical releases, including Super 8 and Transformers 3 and by an increase in cash taxes paid related to the higher pretax income. ", "In terms of our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost of 5.8%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace. We had no variable rate debt outstanding at quarter end. As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $7 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $955 million of cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we paid off the remaining $193 million of outstanding of our 5.75% senior notes when they came due on April 30. ", "At June 30, our $2 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.8x, which is below our target level. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x. ", "In terms of returning capital to our shareholders, between our buyback and dividend programs for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we have returned a total of approximately $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders. We increased our dividend by 67% to $0.25 per share beginning with the dividend payment we made back on July 1.", "Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $900 million of our stock in the September quarter. So for the fiscal year 2011, when you consider dividends and share repurchases, we will return a total of $2.9 billion of capital to our shareholders. That is a return of 11% based on this morning's market cap. ", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of advertising, our upfront base provides a solid foundation for our ad sales next year. Philippe discussed our expectations for the domestic ad sales growth in the September quarter. In terms of international ad sales, the June quarter benefited from integrated marketing events, which have become an important and growing part of our international ad sales model. In the September quarter, we will not have as many of these events, and this will result in a somewhat lower growth rate when compared to the June quarter's 30% rate of growth. ", "As for affiliate revenue, we feel very good about our ability to grow these revenues and the incremental opportunity to monetize our content with fast-growing digital distribution partners provides further upside. On an annual basis, we continue to see affiliate revenue growth in high single-digit to double-digit range based on this year's affiliate revenue base, which includes incremental digital agreement revenue. However, given that the recognition on some of these deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. ", "At Media Networks, we continue to expect that our programming expense will grow in the range of 7.5% to 8% for the full year. Given our current estimate of our domestic versus international profitability mix, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 35% for the fiscal year 2011.", "Now turning to the September quarter. We like how the quarter is shaping up. As of now, the advertising marketplace remains solid and we are launching a number of new and returning series, including Season 4 of Jersey Shore, which premiered last night. At Paramount, the release of Transformers 3 has achieved global success and has already exceeded $1 billion in box office sales. The studio should see strong growth in profit for the quarter as it benefits from the performance of Transformers 3 and the pay television availability of other theatrical releases. ", "As we look ahead at the studio's development pipeline, there are a number of sequels to our existing franchises, including Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, which comes out December, as well as sequels to Star Trek, G.I. Joe and Paranormal Activity. The studio's also currently shooting World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt, and they are working on a sequel with the Jack Ryan series with Chris Kline in the lead role.", "In terms of films that leverage our Media Networks brands, paramount is developing a Nickelodeon-branded wide-action movie based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, which is also being developed as an animated TV series on Nick. MTV-branded films will include a remake of Footlose, which comes out this October as well as Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters starting Jeremy Renner, which comes out -- comes in theaters next year. In addition, Paramount's recent announcement to launch an animation division will add one CGI animated franchise per year to the slate starting in 2014.", "In summary, we continue to be excited about the strategic position of Viacom, our creative momentum and our long-term growth prospects. At Media Networks, our investment in research and original programming have strengthened our brand and their connection with consumers. The leverage we are getting from this investment is translating into improved ratings and ad sales performance, including our recently completed upfront. We have also secured long-term growth in our affiliate agreements. The addition of new distributors on digital platforms is an indication of the power of our content and the incremental opportunity to monetize our brands. Paramount has achieved great success at the box office this year. They continue to develop and grow their slate of franchise films without requiring incremental capital. And with their recent decision to launch an in-house animation division, Paramount will develop franchises with consumer product opportunities that leverage the Nickelodeon brand. ", "Our overall focus on organic growth and capital allocation has enabled us to drive both top and bottom line results, while enhancing our margins and increasing our returns to shareholders. We will continue to invest in our programming and in our brand and we will continue to drive incremental efficiencies across all of our operating business. ", "I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "A couple of questions. First off, when you look at Digital, it looks like it added about $70 million in the quarter to your affiliate fees. I'm just wondering how much of that is kind of onetime library availability for the fiscal year? And how do we think about the recurrence of that? And then I have a bigger picture question for Tom. When you talked about capital strategy, you talked about a 1.8x leverage ratio given what I think is going to be robust growth in Q4. It looks like you're going to end the year even with that $900 million at just above 1.5x leverage. It seems with the increasing growth rate of your business that you should be levered closer to 2.5 if not 3x and I'm just curious how you kind of -- what do you do with the cash? It seems like you're outgrowing your leverage strategy given how good the business is doing. And is there a point where you think about something to reset leverage at a higher level, whether it be special dividend or your ramp in buyback, et cetera?", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the digital revenues, as I indicated in my remarks, a lot of the deals that we've been doing do relate primarily to library product, and obviously, the accounting requires us to recognize revenues that relate to products that are available. There are refresh obligations over the course of these agreements, so not all of it is available on the existing agreement. In addition to which, there will be some additional agreements that we'll be entering in to. We are in a number of discussions right now. So that gives us the runway to be able to say that we expect on this higher pace we set this year to continue to grow in high single-digits, if not double-digit rates, every year for the foreseeable future as far as I can say. I'll let Tom talk a little more about our capital strategy, but it is good news that we are continuing to generate free cash flow. We're able to ramp up our return of capital to shareholders. We've managed to increase our dividend, we're increasing the pace of our buybacks and we're doing it in a progressive measured way and we expect to continue to provide great returns to our shareholders for quite some time.", "Thomas Dooley", "Rich, just going to the onetime notion of the digital revenues, there's more, it's not really just a onetime phenomena even in the deals that we have struck, there'll be additional revenue that comes into the company based on the product that has been purchased, when that product either becomes available or when it becomes produced and made available to those digital partners. So it's not a onetime event. However, as I noted in my comments and remarks, it's lumpy or it will be in one quarter, it might not be in the next quarter and then it will come in the following quarter because its driven by availabilities of products for those markets and those windows.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "So if you were $70 million this quarter, it's fair to say that the overall number is well over triple figures for the year?", "Thomas Dooley", "We're not breaking out the number but it is a significant amount of money that will come in over the next several years. And this is not the only part of it. It will be significant in every year and into the future. The leverage ratio of 2x is a target that we have set for ourselves as a leverage ratio that we're going to stick to and be committed to. From a capital markets point of view, we think it's very important for us to run the company with that. And we also think that given the cash flow generation capabilities of Viacom, we'll be able to buy a significant amount of shares back well within -- while maintaining that leverage ratio. So given how we see the cash flow dynamics of Viacom on a go-forward basis, we're going to buy back a lot of shares at these bargain prices.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was also particularly interested in the comments regarding sustainable growth in digital licensing revenue. I think we are all trying to figure out what multiple to put on that profit stream. So I understand what might drive the revenues in the short-term fiscal '11, fiscal '12. But you detailed confidence in multiyear growth. Can you just show share with us the specific drivers that give you confidence that there will be growth well off into the future?", "Philippe Dauman", "Doug, let's start with -- we have affiliate revenue in the so-called traditional distribution arena. And by the way, I say so-called because many of the traditional distributors are, by the way, interested in getting incremental digital rights as we go forward and some of those discussions are taking place as well. And under the so-called traditional agreements we had in place, these are generally long-term agreements. We know what the increases are in those agreements. We don't have any year going forward where more than 20% of our revenues are up in our traditional sort of revenue streams. So we have a lot of visibility there in the, what you would now call, the pure digital distribution players and that the number of players continues to increase, there is great demand for our content for obvious reasons. We own a lot of content. The content skews young. These are people who use these distribution platforms and it provides us with great opportunity, not just in the U.S. but internationally where you will see much more business being done in that arena. Some of the deals we're doing, they tend to be shorter term than the traditional deal, but they're starting again to be 2-year type of deals and so forth. And as they become more established, they could get longer. There's just a lot of demand, a lot of visibility and our content resonates particularly in all parts of distribution. So we have a lot of confidence in what we see ahead. The high single-digit rate of growth that we are talking about should be relatively easy to achieve and that's why we talk about high single digit to low double digit, which as that form of distribution grows could become more and more of a reality for us as we go forward.", "Thomas Dooley", "Doug, an interesting statistic that supports the popularity of our programming in both the new digital distribution world and in, more importantly, in the existing digital distribution world and cable operators free video on demand distribution from January 2011 to June 2011, Viacom product was downloaded 581 million times, which is a phenomenal number but it indicates the popularity of our product and the popularity of our product within cable system. So we think there's great opportunity to continue to use these new models to distribute our content to consumers.", "Douglas Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG", "If I could just do a quick follow-up, I think this is implicit in your comments but do you see more competitors in the U.S.? Or are you negotiating with more distributors in the U.S. than just Netflix and then Amazon has already started to sign deals? Do you see more than just those 2?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, Doug. The answer's yes. There's a lot of interest in this arena, and it's -- but we've always thrived on competition in the distribution arena and there's now more competition than there's ever been and it's growing. And again, I want to stress it's not just in the U.S. There is increasing competition, we see it in Canada, Latin America, Europe and we expect to see more in Asia as well.", "James Barge", "Very healthy for the price points of product overseas.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "I have a couple for either Tom of Philippe. Can you give a sense of what are the incremental costs associated with doing the digital deals? What type of margins are we talking about for licensing this content?", "Philippe Dauman", "The margins for us are an excess of 75%.", "Michael Nathanson - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. And then, Philippe, there's talk of DreamWorks walking -- animation walking away. What can you do to offset that loss profit associated with that relationship at Paramount on starting animation?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes. There's been what I consider to be a surprising amount of attention on this particular issue. Let me answer it this way. Let's start with the vibrancy of Paramount from both a creative and marketing distribution standpoint. We've had 6 $100 million box office films in a row, including Kung Fu Panda 2 as 1 of the 6. We appreciate Jeffrey's kind remarks last week about how well Paramount distributed Kung Fu Panda 2. We look forward to distributing Puss in Boots in the fall and the 2 pictures remaining next year under our deal. DreamWorks Animation has indicated it's not prepared to address its distribution agreement until next year. In the meantime, we are currently greenlighting and sliding releases for the 2013 release year at Paramount. So given that situation, and the fact that we have a large number of franchises that Tom indicated in his remarks and I indicated in my remarks, we are proceeding on the operating assumption that we will not be extending the DreamWorks Animation deal beyond next year. So we will have a vibrant pipeline of films. Over the long term, our slate will be dictated by our strategy of focusing on our franchises, our brand and it will be supplemented by some third-party distribution products, which I can say would be more tactical. For example, later this year, we're releasing Hugo, the Martin Scorsese movie, which is a distribution film. So those will continually come up and Paramount will do just fine under any scenario, and DreamWorks Animation will be to just fine under any scenario. So we're happy to be in business with them through the studio, through the other parts of our company, and that relation will continue in one form or another.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "First off, you gave us some interesting disclosure in terms of the sources of domestic affiliate growth -- that high singles number with about 25% coming from sub-growth it sounds like. So if you kind of look at the commentary around what we've heard that distributors talk about, you guys would know better than we would what the exact growth is of overall subscription, but it sounds like the majority of the growth would be coming from the increased distribution of existing channels to subscribers as opposed to kind of new overall subscriptions. So could you talk about like are there any platforms that are driving that more than others, expansion of distribution of channels that kind of stand out and the sustainability of that? And then second question is just any commentary around cancellation activity? Have you seen it relatively stable? Given the macro, has there been any change?", "Philippe Dauman", "Okay. On the first question, on the source of domestic affiliate, the traditional source of traditional affiliate growth. Just to clarify, it's 75% based on rate, 25% based on sub-growth. The sub-growth is a combination of the fact the universe is expanding. We do get delayed data, but based on the data that we have, which covers April and May for the quarter, there has been overall growth in MVPD subs in the universe, so some of that sub-growth is general industry growth. And then, some of it is the fact that we still have some of our networks are increasing their distribution footprint. Some of our networks are fully distributed, others, not. So that's -- on the cancellations, what would that relate to?", "Thomas Dooley", "The cancellation, I'm assuming you're referring to options, people taking options in the advertising marketplace?", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Yes, exactly.", "Thomas Dooley", "Any increase of that level of activity whatsoever at this point in time.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Great. Just one quick follow-up, I'm sorry. Philippe, are there any -- in terms of increased distribution, are there any that stand out in terms of the channels that may be increasing distribution?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, you have Centric as an example of a channel that has room to grow. You have a number of our digital networks, whether it's Nicktoons, which is of course very, very successful; TeenNick. So Nickelodeon family channel, Logo, Tr3s. So in the aggregate, we have a number of channels which are enjoying great ratings success in the family and are becoming more and more desirable to both consumers and our distributors.", "Thomas Dooley", "And we brought new channels in from overseas that get distribution that add to the equation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alan Gould with Evercorp Partners.", "Alan Gould - Evercore Partners Inc.", "I've got 2 questions. First, Philippe, can you give any sense on the length of the time of some of these digital distribution deals? I believe a lot of CBS best deals are 2-year deals? And second, can you address the upfront ad sales? How much higher were they? I know their north of 10%, but how much higher were your rates and what sort of volume did you sell out this year?", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as our digital -- again as a general matter, and I addressed that in the previous question. The digital distribution deals tend to be shorter than the traditional deals for now as the marketplace evolves. You hit on 2 years that seems to be the next sort of the average or the median, however you want to call it, deals being done out there, some people are doing them a little longer now. The 3 years are a little shorter. So that's currently the case that might evolve over time. As far as the upfront, we're very satisfied both on pricing and on volume. The average unit pricing that we achieved was in double digits across our portfolio of networks. And as far as the volume growth year-over-year, we were in the teens, in mid-teens in terms of volume growth. So we're very pleased with the platform that gives us as we enter into our new fiscal year in October.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ben Swinburne from M.S.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "I guess I wanted to ask about your digital strategy which sounds like it's continuing to evolve and I would agree with you, the number of new entrants is going to increase. As you mentioned, Philippe, most of the sales have been around library content and I'm wondering how you feel about selling your channels on a linear basis to an online distributor? So just to sort of make up a hypothetical, if Google were to come to you to launch a YouTube product, subscription product that included all your channels and paid you I think it's $350 a month per sub or so which is what you're getting traditionally. Is that a deal you'd consider or do think that gets us too far sort of over the edge on putting the existing model at risk?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, Ben, I don't like to deal with hypotheticals and nor do I like to negotiate in public, but let's look back at history. Yes, we -- historically, we dealt with one distributor, Ben, and that was the local cable company. And then, satellite distribution emerged and we did -- and we established a model with satellite distribution and Telco Distribution established a model. The digital distribution model right now is very differentiated. The Google+ model is different from the Netflix model is different from the Amazon model. So they made different ways of selling their content. Some of it is analogous to syndication, some of is more analogous or closer to traditional ways, VOD. But we're open to different models as long as they generate incremental monetization opportunities both short term and long term, we do think about the long term for our content and our brands, and we are very thoughtful about it and we differentiate among the different types of content that we have. I'll show you an example, and I've used this example before, we will air online Daily Show and Colbert earlier than we would some other shows because there is a new episode every day and we have found that the digital distribution, the prior day show will help drive the marketing on our traditional channels for those shows. So that might not be the case for other shows, which repeat more on our air. So we're getting increasingly sophisticated as we go forward in how our digital distribution strategy should evolve.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Miller with Caris & Company.", "David Miller - Caris & Company", "Philippe, not to beat a dead horse here, but just another question on DreamWorks Animation. It just seems to me, and this is my personal opinion, feel free to disagree, that these DWA movies could emerge from their deficit situations a lot quicker in the global theatrical frame if the print and advertising number was significantly less. And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, that the P&A number for Rango was materially less than your sort of typical generic P&A number for the DWA movies. Do you agree with that, number one. And number two, has that been in any way kind of a bone of contention between you and Jeffrey and a source of the notion that you guys could be cutting DWA loose?", "Philippe Dauman", "First, let me stress that Jeffrey and I have a very good strong relationship. We have a deep relationship between our companies. It's not just a Paramount relationship, it's a Viacom relationship. And by the way, I'm a big believer on the A part of the P&A spending. Advertising does work and drive the motion pictures and other products around the world. And we've certainly done I think a great job in marketing the DreamWorks Animation films. We've done it in close coordination between Paramount and DreamWorks Animation, and our people are very committed to doing a great job on those shows. So...", "Thomas Dooley", "And -- I mean, Jeffrey is a person who is really intimate with the details and the distribution of all this product and works with Paramount hand in glove to set those targets. So there's nothing being done there that he's not in total accord with and it proves very successful in terms of the overall worldwide distribution of those films.", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes. I mean, as I've said, in the notion, there's been any kind of friction in connection with distribution of the films under this arrangement is fantasy because the relationship is very good and the only issue is what DreamWorks Animation wants to do strategically happens to expire and how that fits in with our own strategic objectives. And that's all there is to it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's equity group.", "Tuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "[indiscernible] as well. So on the deal that you did with Netflix in Canada, I believe that was due to the legal restrictions in that market. So as you think about other regions, are there -- would that be a strategy that you might want to adopt to do an exclusive pay TV window kind of deal in markets, other markets that such restrictions might also be applicable? China comes to mind. Or even in other markets where there are no such restrictions, would you be willing to do those kinds of exclusive pay TV window deals with Netflix? And then the second question, if I may, just kind of going down memory lane. As I think about 5 to 6 years ago when the 2 companies were separated, right? So Viacom and CBS and Viacom being positioned as the growth company and CBS as a value of company. Clearly, both companies have been tremendous well since then, so that's a good thing. But it seems like in the investors' minds at least the lines between the 2 are becoming more and more blurred, so both companies now paying dividends and share buybacks that I know since the separation, and you guys launch Epix and CBS launching the studio, you're doing the same digital deals with the Netflix and Hulus of the world. So the question is now, now that this line is blurring and investors are really curious to know, what is it that really separates these 2 companies? I mean, what is the core kind of thesis for both Viacom and CBS now that there seem like there's kind of content convergence on both sides? So any color on that would be helpful from Philippe or perhaps Sumner might also want to chime in.", "Philippe Dauman", "I'll address both questions. As far as the pay window for our films outside of the U.S., yes, we did do an exclusive deal with Netflix in Canada at a very attractive price compared with the incumbent alternative. We are in -- we have been having discussions in other parts of the world with Netflix and other players as well as traditional distributors. Again, it is injected either opportunity, as you point out, in some countries where the pay market is not so robust or competition with incumbents, and we are driven to attain the best modernization we can for the pay window. So I do expect that you will see more of these deals with not just Netflix, but potentially other players. I would mention LOVEFiLM film as an example in Europe. As far as the split, that's going to be ancient history at this point. I and our management team are focused on Viacom. We have a great strategy focused on our content. We are 100% focused on our content and our brands. That strategy and our focus are playing out really well and we see growth ahead in our business as we've discussed this morning, and we are also happy to be able to return a lot of capital to our shareholders both in the form of dividend and buyback given our cash flow generation and our complete focus on organic development of our brand.", "Tuna Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "Any comments on China?", "Philippe Dauman", "China is I hope a long-term opportunity for our company. It's been a limited short-term opportunity for some of our films like Transformers that we have great domestic box office performance, but in our Media Networks business, the environment continues to be fairly restrictive. To the extent that digital distribution opens up opportunities in China, I have had some discussions with a couple of the emerging players there and that could perhaps be an entry point into China. But I don't see China as a big short term in any of that opportunity for us as compared to markets like India, for example.", "Thomas Dooley", "The film market there is growing nicely and Transformers 3 has done remarkably very well.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was just wondering if you could comment on international margins. I mean, given a -- where they are now and also, it seems like the long-term opportunity if anything has gotten better, given the growth in subs and advertising and the corresponding affiliate fees. So could you just comment overall where you think that can go?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, Jessica, I think it's a great long-term opportunity for our company and an area of great focus for us right now. Our current margins have grown to mid-teens. We are well on track to achieving our previously announced goal of getting to the 20-plus percent margin territory within the next 2 to 3 years, probably closer to 2 years in our international media business. That's going to be done through a combination of growing our brands there, getting more focused operationally. We have specific plans to do this region by region, country by country and I'm very pleased with the success that we're enjoying. And increasing our reach through the Paramount brand, the BET brand, the new Blink brand that we launch in Poland, that will help us get there.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter ended December 31. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.

Redstone", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning to all. I am pleased to once again also join Philippe, Tom, Jimmy to discuss Viacom's quarterly results. Despite a choppy overall economy, it was in fact another successful period on both the top and bottom line for Viacom as we continue to use our creative resources, our financial discipline to deliver for shareholders. Our Media Networks are highly in demand all over the world. The creative minds behind our brands are constantly evolving our private property to ensure genuine connections in our industry [ph], new opportunities for our business partners. Paramount Pictures continued to prove they have an unparalleled ability to market and distribute a great slate of motion pictures and ended the calendar year ranked #1 of all the United States box office, the #1 studio. We are indeed in a strong position [indiscernible]. Then, of course, is this possible with our outstanding leadership. Our experienced management team skillfully execute our plans to provide valuable creative content to audiences across the globe for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn this call over to the leader of that team, a man who I appropriately call the wisest man I have ever met, my friend and colleague, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today. Despite headwinds in ad sales, Viacom ended the first quarter of our fiscal year with significant strength. Across the company, we have real momentum. Creative and operational excellence are showing through in every corner of our business and at this early stage, we are seeing ad sales improvement in the second quarter. We're continuing to invest in more and more original programming to strengthen our brands and their deep audience connections. It was true in 2011 and it will be true again in 2012. In fact, in our 2012 fiscal year, Viacom will invest about $3 billion in our Media Networks programming. As a result, our Media Networks attract the most desirable audiences, making Viacom a first-choice partner for marketers and distributors alike. This investment and those relationships will drive our success quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year.", "We continue to see strong affiliate growth as both existing and emerging distributors turn to our brand to fuel their products and services. We expect our affiliate revenue to grow on an annualized basis in the high-single to low-double digit for the foreseeable future. As we unlock value for our content across platform, we're unlocking growth potential across global markets as well, expanding our footprint and margins internationally with our Media Networks and Paramount's rich film library. Creative success and operational discipline are hand in glove at Paramount Pictures, and the studio remains focused on its strategy of releasing a streamlined slate of franchise tentpoles and reasonably priced films with box office potential, supported by one of the industry's finest distribution and marketing organizations.  And that strategy is clearly working as evidenced by Paramount's outstanding performance as the #1 studio at the worldwide box office in 2011.", "Finally, by operating efficiently, managing costs and seizing every opportunity to monetize our content, we continue to generate significant free cash flow and to make good on our commitment to return substantial capital to our shareholder both in the form of stock buybacks and dividends.", "This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the first quarter and share highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions. Let's begin with the numbers.", "Viacom's consolidated revenues grew 3% to $3.95 billion in the first quarter, driven by growth in both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment segments. Media Networks delivered 3% growth in revenues and a 7% increase in operating income on strong increases in affiliate revenues. Filmed Entertainment grew revenues by 4%, driven by higher theatrical revenues, but solid bottom line decline due largely to the comparison with the sale of Marvel Studios' distribution rights in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. Our net earnings from continuing operations decreased 5% to $591 million in the December quarter and diluted earnings per share increased to $1.06, up 4% over the first quarter of fiscal 2011. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repurchased $700 million in stock and in the current quarter, we are on track to buy back another $700 million.", "Let's turn now to our Media Networks. Our portfolio of cable networks is the strongest in the industry, accounting for a far greater share of all basic cable viewing in the U.S. than any other programming group. We built equity with our audiences by knowing and understanding them better than anyone. We have a proven ability to translate consumer insights into compelling original programming, innovative multi-platform content and valuable connections through social media. We will continue to invest judiciously in original programming, research and marketing to keep our Media Networks thriving regardless of changes in the media landscape and economic environment.", "As I indicated in December, we did see softness in the overall ad market during our fiscal first quarter. For the quarter, our advertising revenues decreased 3% domestically and 4% internationally. Domestic declines were driven by significant softness in volume in the scatter market, especially after Thanksgiving and previously discussed rating softness. We are seeing signs of recovery in the current quarter scatter with a number of buyers returning to the market. As they do, we are confident that our brands will capture their share of dollars.", "Shifting gears to distribution. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased by 16%, driven by significant rate increases and the benefits of digital distribution. During the quarter, we successfully closed a number of affiliate deals and expanded existing agreements, including growing our HD footprint with several cable and telco providers. We also locked up additional distribution deals, including our launch with the debut of Netflix in the U.K. And next week, a new online partner will announce a deal we just signed that involves a wide selection of our library content. Partnerships like these are high-margin opportunities to monetize our content library. We see a significant opportunity for continued growth here.", "We are also stressing our relationships with traditional distributors by fueling the expansion of their products and services, including increased offerings across VOD, authenticated websites and apps and ITV. As we continue to innovate and expand our partnerships with our existing distributors, we are constantly evaluating new distribution opportunities for our content, both long and short form.", "International growth is a key priority for Viacom. Over the last several years, we have made it a strategic priority to streamline and strengthen our international organization, pursue strategic initiatives and partnerships and launch more channels and more original programming to drive ratings and revenue. We're seeing real progress. As we said on the last call, we are well on our way to achieving our goal of 20-percent plus margins internationally in our next fiscal year.", "The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a very strong quarter for Viacom International Media Networks, driven by affiliate growth and expanded efficiencies. We see our affiliate growth continuing and ad sales growth returning as we move forward.", "Our priority channels for global expansion showed strong ratings growth. Internationally, ratings at Nickelodeon and Comedy were up substantially. The EMAs, MTV's signature international tentpole, saw ratings up 37% across global markets. We successfully launched new comedy channels in Holland, India and Africa and yesterday, in Latin America. We'll be announcing more comedy launches soon.", "We have also begun a number of consumer products initiatives. Consumer products is another area with significant upside over the next several years. Our pipeline is rich with character-driven content in Nickelodeon and our new Paramount Animation label that will help drive consumer products growth in the long-term.", "Moving to ratings highlights at our domestic Media Networks. The first quarter of fiscal 2012 was MTV's highest-rated December quarter in 4 years and the network's eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth overall. MTV continues to assert itself as the cultural home of the millennial generation with a smart mix of original reality and scripted programming. Jersey Shore was the #1 show in MTV's target 12-34 demo every week it aired and returned this quarter with a premiere episode that attracted 7.6 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 was the #3 original cable series in the 12-34 demo for the quarter and new shows, Ridiculousness, Beavis and Butthead and breakout scripted-hit, Awkward, all placed among the top 25.", "MTV also built on a social media dominance, finishing the first quarter as the #1 media network on Facebook, the #1 brand on Foursquare and Tumblr and the most social cable network of 2011 according to SocialGuide. In the current quarter, MTV will see the premieres of a new scripted series, I Just Want My Pants Back, which debuts tonight; the launch of a Jersey Shore spinoff with Pauly D; the return of pop-culture phenomenon, Punk'd and a new season of 16 & Pregnant.", "Comedy Central continues to draw its core male audience with great original programming anchored by its dominant late-night block, which is stronger than ever with election 2012 gaining steam. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart turned in a historic performance in the 2011 calendar year, surpassing NBC's The Tonight Show as the #1 late-night show with viewers 18-49 for the first time ever.", "For the quarter, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report were the highest-rated and most-watched late-night shows on all of television with male and total viewers aged 18-34. Newcomer, Workaholics, continued to build its fan base, finishing the calendar year as the #1 new comedy on all television with men 18-24. And finally, we renewed South Park through 2016, ensuring a milestone 20 seasons in a landmark animated series.", "Comedy Central has great momentum in the current quarter as well. Just this week, we saw the strong season premiere of Tosh.0, which drew 3.1 million viewers as well as the series premiere of new sketch comedy show, Key & Peele, which drew 2.1 million total viewers, making it the biggest series launch on Comedy in more than 2 years.", "Despite the measurement issues we mentioned on last quarter's call, Nickelodeon finished the fiscal quarter as the #1 cable network with both kids and total viewers for the 67th consecutive quarter, highlighted by the launch of Kung Fu Panda and the second installment in the Fred TV movie franchise, which averaged 7 million total viewers. On Nick at Nite, our third annual HALO Awards, honoring teens for their commitment to service, delivered the tentpoles' highest ratings ever with teens and tweens.", "This fiscal year, Nickelodeon will premiere more than 500 episodes of original programming, more than ever before, and we will keep layering on new shows to rebuild our rating.  The current quarter has been full of live-action premieres, including iCarly, which has attracted more than 4 million viewers in each of its 3 episodes this quarter and grown ratings in key kids 6-11 demo with each episode. House of Anubis ratings are also climbing steadily with ratings improving 10% in the week following its January premiere. Last Saturday, the premier of Victorious was the #1 program on cable, attracting 3.9 million viewers.", "This Saturday, we premiere How to Rock, staring Cymphonique Miller and in March, we'll debut a new TV movie from Big Time Rush, who along with Fresh Beat Band, were 1 of 2 Nickelodeon kids music act to sell out a nationwide concert tour last quarter. Additionally, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. will have new episodes of their gold standard preschool educational programming such as Dora the Explorer and the Bubble Guppies and will launch new series, Mike the Knight and a new CG version of Franklin and friends. Nickelodeon will conclude the quarter with the Kid's Choice Award, hosted this year by Will Smith on March 31.", "BET continued to roll as the network built on its lineup of original scripted series with Reed Between the Lines, which ranked in the top 5 among new scripted series on basic cable. The BET Hip Hop Awards 2011 premier in October drew in 4.1 million viewers, making it the most-watched edition of the franchise tentpole in its 60-year history. The current quarter saw the return of Let's Stay Together, which attracted 3.5 million total viewers with its season premiere and smash hit, THE GAME, which debuted its fifth season last month with a premier that attracted 5.3 million viewers, thanks in part to a dynamic social media marketing strategy.", "VH1's ratings momentum picked up steam in the first quarter with ratings in primetime up 42% year-over-year and 72% in the key women 18-34 demographic. The current quarter saw the return of hit series, Mob Wives, which attracted 2.4 million total viewers in its premiere broadcast. The 2011 VH1 DIVAS Celebrates Soul broadcast, featuring Mary J. Blige, Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson, scored the franchise's highest rating since it returned in 2009, doubling ratings over last year's show.", "Spike continued to broaden its appeal with men of all ages through original hits, including Auction Hunters and Flip Men. The original comedy, Blue Mountain State, delivered its highest-rated season to date, up 20% in the key men 18-34 demo. This quarter, Spike very successfully launched INK MASTER, the Dave Navarro-hosted tattoo competition, which is building into a bona fide major hit.", "TV Land continued to cement its standing as the home of the sitcom on cable with the return of Hot In Cleveland and the premiere of The Exes. In fact, Hot In Cleveland just won the People's Choice Award for favorite cable TV sitcom and star, Betty White, won the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series. TV Land also picked up a Hot In Cleveland spinoff starring Cedric \"The Entertainer\" and Niecy Nash.", "CMT continues to grow its offering of original programming, delivering 4 original series in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, including Sweet Home Alabama. In the current quarter, CMT launched 3 new series, including Bayou Billionaires and My Big Red Neck Vacation, which debuted as the highest-rated original series telecast in CMT history.", "Let's turn now to Filmed Entertainment. Paramount, which proudly celebrates its 100th year in 2012 as the oldest studio in Hollywood, ended the calendar year with a record $5.17 billion at the worldwide box office, including its first $1 billion franchise, Transformers. The first fiscal quarter of 2012 was highlighted by the blockbuster performance of Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, which reinvigorated the Tom Cruise-starring franchise under the guidance of director, Brad Bird and producer, J.J. Abrams and is now the-highest grossing Mission: Possible; the successful release of Paranormal Activity 3, which continued the phenomenal profitability of that franchise and the outstanding distribution of Hugo and DreamWorks Animation's Puss In Boots. In the current quarter, we released The Devil Inside, another highly profitable title for us with franchise potential from our Insurge label.", "Our original and distributed films also scored a number of Acadamy Award nominations led by Hugo, which scored 11 nominations, including Best Picture and a directing nod for Martin Scorsese. Our very own Rango, as well as both DreamWorks Animation films were nominated for Best Animated Feature Film.", "Looking ahead, Paramount with Fox will rerelease TITANIC digitally remastered in 3D, thanks to a painstaking conversion helmed by director Jim Cameron. Paramount will also release The Dictator, starring Sacha Baron Cohen and directed by Larry Charles, the team behind Borat; and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the next film in the global franchise starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Channing Tatum. And the studio will build value by supporting our international division's launch of Paramount television channel, the first of which will debut in Spain in the coming months.", "In sum, despite some early headwinds, Viacom is off to a strong start in fiscal 2012. As we move forward, our consistent focus on content and brand building will drive creative momentum across the company in the full freight of original programming launching across our network and in the focus and franchise-centric releases from our studio. We will seek out and seize every opportunity on every platform to monetize our content both in the United States and internationally. And our disciplined operation and management for top and bottom line growth will give us the continued flexibility to invest in content and return substantial capital to our shareholders for many years to come.", "With that, I will turn it over to Jimmy.", "James W. Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and Web presentation, summarizing the results of our December quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly. This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. Before I do that, I'd like to note that discontinued operations in the December quarter of this year reflects the $383 million charge related to the earn-out dispute with the former shareholders of Harmonix. In this regard, I would note that we have filed a lawsuit seeking to compel consideration of arguments and evidence that we believe were inappropriately excluded from the dispute resolution process.", "Now, let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenue increased 3% and international revenues increased 2% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.", "Page 9 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues declined 3% in the quarter. International advertising declined 4% with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 1 percentage point. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to the timing of event-driven programming.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 16% while international revenues increased 18%. The growth in domestic affiliate revenues was driven by the availability of programming associated with digital distribution agreement as well as by rate increases from traditional distributors. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreement, rate and subscriber increases and new channel launches.", "Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 13% in the quarter, principally due to lower home entertainment revenue. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion in the quarter increased 7% over last year. The operating margin of 46% improved 190 basis points over the prior year.", "The improvement in the margin was driven by revenue growth of 3% and a 1% decline in expenses. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a 2% decline in programming expense, resulting from the timing of new program launches as well as the timing of event-driven programming in the prior year.", "Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter increased 4% to $1.6 billion. Page 11 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 37% to $570 million in the quarter. The increase in theatrical revenues was principally due to the strength of our current quarter's releases, including Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Paranormal Activity 3 and Puss In Boots. Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 6% to approximately $600 million. The decrease primarily reflects lower revenues from third-party distribution titles, partially offset by the performance of Transformers 3 in international market.", "TV license fees increased 9% to approximately $300 million. The increase in TV license fees was due to higher pay-TV revenues, partially offset by lower network TV revenues, resulting from a fewer number of titles available in the quarter. Ancillary revenues declined 46% to $92 million. Ancillary revenues faced difficult comparisons as the prior year benefited from the sale of the distribution rights to Avengers and Iron Man 3 to Marvel. Partially offsetting this were higher consumer products and digital revenues.", "Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $31 million in the quarter as compared to income of $68 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects the difficult comparison to last year's sale of distribution rights to Marvel as well as the timing of P&A expense related to the theatrical release of Mission: Impossible, partially offset by the international home entertainment performance of Transformers 3.", "Now moving below operating income. Total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX, which was partially offset by losses at our Viacom 18 India TV venture that reflect cost associated with our investments in new channel launches. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Jimmy, and good morning, everyone. Let's talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, the return of capital to our shareholders as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of free cash flow for the quarter, we generated approximately $600 million in operating free cash flow in the December quarter compared to approximately $700 million last year. Page 4 of the Web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to higher working capital utilization, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The working capital used in the quarter was primarily due to the timing of theatrical releases, including Mission: Impossible III.", "As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at the quarter end of 5.5%. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.", "During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to refinance certain of our higher coupon notes, as well as to maintain our leverage at our target level. We issued $600 million of 3.875% senior notes due in 2021 and $400 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2016. In conjunction with this, we called the $750 million of outstanding of our 6.85% senior notes due in 2055.  The notes were callable at par and were redeemed on January 9. The combination of these actions will lower our interest cost by approximately $20 million on an annual basis.", "In addition, during the quarter, we amended our bank line by improving the pricing and extending the maturity date to December 2015, further enhancing our liquidity. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $7.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and approximately $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.", "At December 31, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 1.95x. As I just mentioned, we redeemed our 6.85% senior notes on January 9. If you pro forma for the redemption at quarter end, our debt and capital leases outstanding would be $7 billion and our leverage ratio would be 1.8x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at least 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 10x.", "In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $840 million of capital back to our shareholders in the December quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter. So for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2012 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, on an annual basis, we continue to see revenue growth in the high single-digit to double-digit range based on 2011 affiliate revenue base, which includes incremental digital agreement. Given that revenue recognition on some of the digital deals is tied to product availability, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will not be as linear as it has been in the past. In the March quarter, we expect the affiliate revenue growth to be in the low-teens.  Our expected growth rate for Media Networks programming expense remains mid- to high-single digits for fiscal 2012. Accordingly, given the pace of programming expense in the December quarter, we anticipate that programming expense will grow in the high-single to low-double-digit percentage range for the remainder of the fiscal year.", "Our ongoing expense management will enable us to continue to grow our margin as we invest in our brand. Paramount has achieved global box office success with its latest sequel to the Mission: Impossible franchise. And accordingly, Paramount should see healthy growth in profit in the March quarter as it benefits from the performance of Mission: Impossible as well as from lower print and advertising costs. We continue to expect to realize approximately $100 million in cost savings this year related to the restructuring charge we took back in the September quarter.", "For 2012, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. In terms of cash taxes, given the sunsetting in December of tax benefits related to accelerated deductions of films and TV production, we expect cash taxes to mirror book taxes for the year. As for our stock buyback program, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the March quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for the fiscal 2012 year.", "Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline. In April, Paramount and Fox will rerelease James Cameron's TITANIC in 3D and in May, the studio will release The Dictator, which stars Sacha Baron Cohen. Paramount will also be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3 in early June.", "In addition, the studio has a number of sequels to existing franchises as well as new franchises in development. This summer, the studio will release G.I. Joe 2 and in the fall, they release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. Paramount is working on World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt and One Shot, starring Tom Cruise, which is based on the best-selling novel and Jack Reacher business book series, and J.J. Abrams is currently in production on the next installment of Star Trek.", "To wrap up, we continue to operate with the focus on pursuing organic opportunities in our core businesses. And we remain committed to investing in our brand and strengthening their competitive position. This focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure, will enable us to drive earning per share and drive free cash flow. We are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises. The addition of new distribution partners on digital platforms, the opportunity to grow our international business and profitability and the ability to develop franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. In addition, we remain committed to an aggressive capital return program of share buyback and dividend, which we believe will drive value for our shareholders over the long-term.", "I want to thank you for listening, and now we'll turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Let me have just one general on advertising for anyone who wants answer, then one on Philippe on Nickelodeon. So on advertising, people definitely going to focus on the minus 3 domestic number, and I want to get a sense of how much of that minus 3 was driven by the Nickelodeon problems in the quarter. So what would the growth be? What range of growth would be in advertising, taking out Nickelodeon for the quarter?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Michael, if you -- if we haven't had the Nick ratings issue, our advertising sales would have been a growth for the quarter, would have been up rather than down for the quarter. The other factor that impacted ad sales during the quarter was weakness in the scatter market. And looking at individual advertisers, we saw several advertisers that appear to have hold into the upfront some of the scatter money that they would otherwise have spent. So that was something that's hard to measure until we got to the quarter. So we saw people that focused in advertisers that increased their upfront buy and then had a corresponding decrease in their scatter buy in the quarter.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Philippe, would it be safe to assume low-singles, taking out the Nick problems, is that kind of the range of growth?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then on scatter versus scatter volume, how much was it down, putting aside Nick? When you mentioned the upfront commitments, but just scatter versus scatter volume for you guys for the quarter, how much was that down?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, it was -- I don't want to quantify it exactly, but it was down significantly and particularly at the end of the quarter, and we believe that, that was a reflection of the general market environment. We believe that there were a number of companies that were pulling back on their expenses as they were closing out their year. And we see some of those very same advertisers coming back in this quarter, which leads us to that conclusion.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Are we -- in terms of rate, would you say teens-like in -- teens-types of volume changes?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then last one would be, you're starting to some press articles about possibly linking Netflix and Netflix' kids product with Nickelodeon's ratings declines. And I wonder now you have more time to look at -- you've had some more time looking at the Nickelodeon rating issues, what can you say about the availability of Nickelodeon content on Netflix and what's -- what that is doing to Nickelodeon ratings?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we look at that very closely. And we don't think that the availability of the limited amount of Nickelodeon library content that we have on Netflix has had a significant impact on the ratings. Again, remember, the Netflix universe is a rather small fraction of the overall television household numbers, number one. And number two, yes, we do get data on our streams and the both the number of Netflix subscribers and the number of Nickelodeon content streams were pretty much the same between the summer and the fall. So there was no real change that accounted for the fall drop, which we did not see in the summer. So there could have been some minimal impact, but it certainly does not account for the range drop that we saw. We -- as I said on the last call, we believe there was some ratings systemic issues. Again, I don't want to belabor it because we did in the last call. But the pretty extensive set-top-box data that we have does in no way reflect what we're seeing in the Nielsen measurement. That being said, that's the environment we're operating in and we're going to attack it as we always do, and which is to go after our audience. And we'll go after that new Nielsen sample and we'll -- the programs will appeal. And I'm confident that as the year progresses, you will see improvement in Nickelodeon's ratings. And again, finally, on that point, it did impact last quarter's ad revenues in a significant way. But as I said again on the last call, that was the significant quarter, where that has a big impact. In the remainder of the fiscal year, we have a low proportion of ad sales that are tied-in to Nickelodeon, and we have more unit availabilities in the quarters than you have in that multi-week period leading up to the holidays in the fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take a question from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Couple questions just on the health of the advertising market. Could you comment? You said things are getting better in the March quarter. I guess could you comment on how you're seeing scatter trend versus the upfront? And any comments on cancellations for the June commitment? I think we're in that period right now. And then secondly, to your point that you have less of a headwind, less of a concentration of Nickelodeon revenues in the March quarter and you said things have picked up a little bit, I guess, any framework on how we should see advertising revenue for the March quarter will be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Alexia, the scatter pricing, for what it's worth, is holding up well. We see scatter-to-scatter pricing up and it's up in the -- I would say now about the mid-single digits and healthy double digit over upfront pricing. Our level of cancellations is probably lower than normal and very low single digits. Again, it reflects people buying, companies buying in the upfront. It's the prices that were attractive compared to the scatter market. And in terms of the framework for the quarter, it is -- our earnings release is quite early in the quarter and given what happened last quarter, I'm going to say it's going to be better and we think it'll be positive. I think it's too early to put a framework on it. But as we get later in the quarter and I'll have opportunities to address investors in a public forum, I'll be able to put a little more boundary around it as we get further along the quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "For Philippe, I think there's a perception that kids sometimes don't care whether a TV show is an original or a repeat and you've been emphasizing the record number of original episodes coming. I was hoping you could provide an empirical solution to that debate. Is there a material difference in ratings between the original episodes and the repeats? And if you have a sense of how much that difference is, that would be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, and when we premiere a new episode, it's substantially higher than the repeat. So I gave you some of the numbers on fresh episodes of iCarly and Victorious as an example. We haven't had fresh episodes of SpongeBob recently, but we will be coming on with those. So clearly, whenever we have new material, it draws a substantial viewership. That's why as we layer on more of these new episodes of existing series and we layer on new series, those are the building blocks for building Nick ratings whatever environment we begin with. We start from the base that we have and we will build it up.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "When you mentioned 500 episodes of originals, you don't have handy the similar number from last year, what kind of growth that is year-over-year?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "It's about 1/3 more than we had last year, something in that neighborhood, about 30% or low-30s.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And if I could just squeeze one in for Tom. Your guidance for cable network margin expansion for fiscal '12, I'm just wondering what level of cost flexibility you have to achieve that if advertising proves disappointing at all? Or put it another way, if advertising does remain soft the rest of the year, can you still achieve margin expansion in cable networks?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Well, it depends on how you define soft. But right now, we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to improve margins on a year-over-year basis with the flexibility that we have and our ability to really control the costs quite well. And I think we've demonstrated that in the past and I think we'll be able to roll that forward into the future unless there's a really horrible ad market.", "Operator", "We'll take a question from Alan Gould from Evercore Partners.", "Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. First, with respect to the ad revenue in the March quarter, Philippe, I think the Kids' Choice Awards this year are March; last year, that was April, so that should improve the quarter, I think, about 2 percentage points, and then you've got the less Nick seasonality. So doesn't the 2 of those events get you to a positive number in the March quarter before we even consider an improvement in scatter pricing?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Alan, yes, as I said, I do expect that we'll have positive ad sales growth performance in the quarter. But it's just too early in the quarter for me to go beyond that, how far positive they will be.", "Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the second question is last year, you started talking about the incremental research that you were doing which was helping the ratings. What's happening with the research now? And how is that impacting the programming and the ratings?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we continue to invest in research and understanding our audiences better and how they use new platforms, and it's informing our selection of programming on different networks. We have a continued orientation to increasing original programming across many of our networks. In my remarks, I cited a number of examples that really cuts across almost every one of our networks. And in particular, with the youngs-viewing networks, we want to understand how the sensibilities evolve. We are also more and more creating associated content on multiple platforms and creating new features such as WatchWith, which MTV adopted to allow people to get more information on the shows like Jersey Shore while they are watching it and interact with our characters and live tweeting and all of these things. So it's really a funnel, what we're doing now and helping us plan for the future as we develop programming not just for the television screen but across multiple screens.", "Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Well, outside of the measurement issue, how do you explain the remainder of the ratings decline? Was it just more repeats, not enough original programming in the quarter?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, look, there are a number of factors. We -- some of our competition laid in a lot more new shows at a time when we didn't have that many. And obviously, we need to have a competitive response to that and we will. And the -- I mean, the biggest part as far as we can tell is just a discrepancy that we see. There will be some soft adjustment even within the Nielsen universe, given the churn that occurs within the 20,000 households, which constitute the Nielsen household. So there'll be changes there and again, we'll do what we know how to do, which is to -- when we have a ratings issue, we tackle it with more research, more programming, better programming and marketing. And we will make sure that our audiences are aware of our new series launches and our new shows and we'll do it through our own channels, off-air. As I mentioned, a couple of our shows are music-based. They have successful concert tours. So we'll use every weapon in our arsenal and we know how to do this, and we've had issues with various networks. We always turn them around.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just to kind of continue along the line of questioning on pricing and volume. I think assuming, Philippe, that scatter volume was down in the teens in the December quarter, I just wonder what's the improvement? What's the continuation of that churn in the March quarter on volume setting aside price? I think you spoke to that already.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, again, we are very early in the quarter, I want to stress that, but volumes are improving. And yes, we'd love to provide more specificity, but we don't want to -- I don't want to get some extrapolation this early in the quarter. We're encouraged by the tone out there in the market. And as we get further along in the quarter, we'll be able to put more meat on the bones there, [indiscernible] market evolve.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just taking a step back more broadly, I mean, Viacom is both a seller and a buyer of advertising, given Paramount. I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about -- are you seeing anything from your customers? Are you seeing anything in the marketplace that would indicate that display advertising or social media is soaking up any demand out there either in terms of volume or in terms of volume as index to price? Just generally when you look at the marketplace and what advertising buyers are really focusing on these days.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, as a buyer of advertising through Paramount, we certainly view that television is the most effective way to build the brand quickly. And of course, when we launch a movie, we want to build that brand quickly. Clearly, we supplement that with social media. But studio spending, there were a lot of titles in the quarter. Studio spending was strong in this past quarter. That was really not an issue. That's not where the demand problem resided. As far as display advertising online, there's clearly -- within that digital marketplace, there's clearly a lot more availability. You saw the Facebook numbers and how they're growing their display advertising numbers. It's certainly taking the wind out of some of their online competitors in display advertising. And it's certainly impacting pricing display advertising in that there's a much larger availability. There's almost unlimited availability of that kind of advertising as opposed to the somewhat tighter or much tighter television market, where there is scarcity for advertisers who want to be on the top shows, the top networks and the ones where viewers have an affinity to the brand and pay more attention than they do with much of display advertising.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jessica Reif-Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just going to switch gears and ask you about international and hopefully, you can give us some more color on your strategy in growing areas like India, Germany and Latin America. How meaningful will the growth be? Several of your competitors have cited a goal of doubling operating income over the next 2 to 3 years.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Jessica. International is a really significant opportunity for us in the long term. I was asked in a December conference to look forward for the company over the next 5 years with the framework, I was asked. And what I said then and I would reiterate today is last year, we did about $200 million of operating income in our international Media Networks. And I expect that to at least triple to quadruple over the next 5 years. And you -- we've reorganized our operations to be much more effective in developing networks and creating revenue opportunities. The digital opportunity international is really significant and opens up avenues for us that were previously closed, where it was more difficult to distribute our content. India is a very successful joint venture. We had great success with the existing networks. We are investing. And as we indicated in our remarks in the last quarter, we -- it was not -- had we just stuck with our existing networks, it would have been a profitable quarter for India, but we chose to invest and build on our strength to launch several networks, and we think we're going to create huge value there. Latin America is a market with a lot of opportunity. We just launched the comedy brand in both Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. So we launched comedy yesterday. We have a lot of opportunities around the world. I think very rapidly in the next 2 to 3 years, you will see in many, many, many countries Paramount channels. The first will be in Spain. We have several others lined up. There's a lot of demand for the library movie channels and of course, Paramount is an exceptional library and brand. So I see a lot of opportunity in emerging markets with opening them up and opportunities in existing markets to launch more of our brands.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And again, switching gears, could you give us an update on your thoughts on distribution for DreamWorks Animation?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, the update is that we're looking forward to the last 2 movies, the last 2 new movies under our deal with Madagascar and Rise of the Guardian at the end of the year. We have valued very much the relationship, thus far, with DreamWorks Animation. Even after the -- these last 2 release of theaters, we will have a long-term continuing relationship as we'll continue to be a distributor for all the movies that have been -- that we have distributed to-date in various windows. It goes for -- I believe, it's 16 years after the release of each movie initially theatrically. And we have many other facets of our relationship with Nickelodeon and the rest, so we have a very powerful lineup going forward. DreamWorks Animation is a successful company, well-led company, and I continue to wish them great success as they move forward from our existing -- the existing nature of our relationship.", "Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then one last thing, a very specific advertising-related question. What is auto advertising as a percent of your total advertising? And what are you seeing in auto in the March quarter?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, auto is a low -- has been a low percentage for us historically. Happily, it is growing at a healthy percentage for us. For us, we have the benefit of the industry, in general, going to smaller car models, appealing to younger consumers. That is our strength. So we're -- we see opportunity in this quarter that we see the auto category growing for us in this quarter and going forward. We think it will grow for -- it will be a continually growing category for us from a low pace. So for us, it's a share opportunity.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "Quick question or 2-part question. First on the upfront, just in terms of with Nickelodeon's ratings issues and it sounds like you're still struggling year-over-year in the early part of calendar Q1, given the Nielsen issues. How does it position you? Or what is -- how does it make kind of the upfront in terms of that process, as I know you're obviously going to start kicking off that process over the next few months? And then two, there was a deal signed this morning between Lionsgate and Starz to basically repurpose their movies after the EPIX window, I presume, onto Starz. Curious what your ability to do something similar with Paramount films in a post-EPIX window. I don't think that's something people have really put a lot of thought towards historically versus keeping them on EPIX for the foreseeable future.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Nickelodeon, of course, has a -- an overwhelming share of the kids ad market, given that the second position kids network does not sell advertising. So we have sort of the upfront in a position of strength. As I've said, we have a great show lined up for Nickelodeon with more coming, including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which are soon to launch. We actually had a good event relating to toys there coming up this week. So we're going to have a lot of promotion around that. So our advertisers love Nickelodeon. They see how advertising in Nickelodeon moves their product, and I think that's a good understanding of what the issues are out there. So we expect a strong upfront for Nickelodeon. As far as exploiting our film library, yes, Paramount, yes, of course, and Lionsgate both very committed to EPIX and some of our older library titles. So we are available to license on other paid services and we have been doing well competitively there. This is -- so the Paramount library, which is of extraordinary quality and continue to build on quality with the new films we're releasing is -- will be a mother lode of opportunity for Paramount for many, many years to come and will be the foundation for building some very valuable assets, EPIX in the U.S. and the Paramount film channels around the world, and we continue to look for more opportunities to monetize those film. They are the ultimate form of content, and we look forward to it being our piggy bank for many years to come.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our CFO.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release and on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner M. Redstone", "I'm really pleased to join you once again as we report Viacom's third quarter results. Viacom's Media Networks are vibrant, focused on developing exciting new properties, maximizing opportunities for our most popular programming, Paramount. We are also making smart, strategic and creative decisions, excellently adapting to the marketplace and providing its films with the best chance of success, But before the marketplace for entertainment content was challenging, it's dynamic and full of opportunities now more than ever. With an outstanding management team and a strong culture of reinvention and innovation, Viacom remains perfectly positioned to recognize and exploit these opportunities here and all over the world.", "I could not be more confident about the future projects for Viacom. And with the lead strong leadership, we are committed, as always, to growing our business here and around the world and generating solid returns to shareholders year in and year out.", "Now I'd like to turn this call over to the man I say is one of the wisest men I have ever met in my life, Philippe. And Philippe, by the way, has been a great warrior. The battle he conducted against DIRECTV was spectacular. I think that Philippe has the same passion to win that I\u2019ve always had. And take my word for this, in the long run, Philippe will win.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.", "Despite challenges, Viacom made solid progress on several fronts in the third quarter of our fiscal year. Our industry-leading brands continue to grow and evolve across platforms, as well as geographic and demographic borders. We continued our sustained investment in creative content, especially at Nickelodeon and other key networks, and we are seeing promising signs that this investment will bear fruit.", "Our strong audience bonds and the breadth of our network portfolio were big factors, not only in our strong performance in the recent advertising upfront, but also in our successful, albeit unnecessarily noisy, completion of an extra long-term carriage deal with DIRECTV 2 weeks ago. The DIRECTV deal keeps us firmly on the path to generate sustainable, high single to low double-digit annual affiliate revenue growth.", "We are also now heading into a period where we will see growing results for our investments in international channel launches and consumer products initiatives. At the same time, Viacom's bottom line benefited from our relentless focus on operational efficiency. This tight rein on costs also serves to fortify our already strong balance sheet. As a result, Viacom remains a reliable generator of significant free cash flow even in challenging times. And we consistently make good on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Through this unwavering strategic focus, Viacom will generate significant long-term value for our shareholders.", "This morning, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the third quarter and review highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will give additional color, and then we'll take your questions.", "Let's begin with the numbers. Viacom's revenues decreased 14% to $3.24 billion in the third quarter, driven primarily by the mix of our Filmed Entertainment titles and lower advertising revenues. Adjusted operating income decreased 9% to $903 million. In our Media Networks segment, revenue declined 5% and adjusted operating income declined 10% due to lower advertising and ancillary revenues. Filmed Entertainment revenues decreased 29%, reflecting the number and mix of releases in the June quarter in comparison to the same period last year, which featured substantial theatrical hits, including Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Super 8, Marvel's Thor and DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda 2. Adjusted operating income in Filmed Entertainment decreased $3 million, reflecting the revenue decline and substantially offset by lower expenses. Viacom's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations declined 12% to $512 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.97 in the June quarter. Foreign exchange negatively affected earnings per share by $0.02.", "In the quarter, Viacom announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share. Last week, our Board of Directors declared our next quarterly cash dividend to be paid October 1. The company also repurchased $700 million in stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter, and we expect to buy back $700 million in stock this quarter, for a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year.", "Let's move on to highlights in our divisions. Our Media Networks experienced some cyclical rating softness that we are well equipped to overcome, as we have demonstrated in the past. More than any other programmer, Viacom's networks are built for reinvention, powered by our $3 billion investment in content this fiscal year. Our networks each have clear, established brand filters, to which they are introducing more and more original content. From BET to MTV to most recently VH1, our brands are consistently able to evolve with audiences, create hits and capture the cultural conversation. For example, 50% of VH1's current primetime schedule consists of returning hits, the highest percentage in 4 years, and the networks hit ratio was up 22% of our fiscal 2011.", "Domestic advertising revenues decreased 7% due to the timing of 2 key award shows, as we previously signaled in our second quarter earnings call, as well as rating softness at certain networks. This year, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards aired in the second quarter, and the BET Awards aired early in the fiscal fourth quarter. Both aired in the third quarter last year, resulting in difficult year-on-year quarterly comps.", "Worldwide advertising revenues decreased 9% for the quarter due to softness in Europe. As I mentioned earlier, we concluded the June quarter by successfully completing our upfront negotiations. We are very pleased with the outcome. Despite ratings issues in Nickelodeon, we were able to maintain the same share of the kids' upfront volume as last year. Overall, our total upfront dollars were more than $2.8 billion, up from last year, and we secured solid mid-single-digit increases in pricing.", "Looking at the current quarter, while it is still early and difficult to predict, we are tracking to sequential improvement in domestic advertising revenue performance. In distribution, domestic affiliate revenues decreased 1% in the third quarter, which primarily reflects the significance of additional distribution revenues recorded in the same quarter last year. Worldwide affiliate fees increased 1%. As we have discussed in the past, revenue recognition requirements relating to digital sales create bumps in our usually steady affiliate sales growth path. If you exclude the impact of digital distribution agreements, our domestic affiliate revenue growth was right on target in the high single digits. In its fourth quarter, domestic affiliate revenue growth will be in double digits.", "Throughout the quarter, we continued to deepen our partnerships with our distributors on existing and emerging platforms. Notably, we increased distribution for a number of our HD simulcast, while also completing an agreement to make our programming available through Time Warner Cable's in-home streaming app.", "As noted earlier, in the current quarter, we successfully completed a challenging renewal negotiation with DIRECTV, striking a long-term agreement with an initial rate increase of significantly more than 20% and healthy annual increases in excess of those we had in the expired deal for the remainder of the 7-year term. In fact, the deal we ultimately signed was materially better for Viacom than the deal that was on the table at the time that DIRECTV made the unfortunate decision to drop our networks. In addition to rate increases, we secured increased or new distribution for Nicktoons, Tr3s and several HD channels. We secured a long-term commitment from DIRECTV to distribute our channels in Latin America via PanAmericana and Sky Brazil. And we forged a long-term agreement for DIRECTV to continue to offer Paramount films on Pay Per View.", "In short, we are extremely pleased with our DIRECTV agreement and only disappointed that so many of our viewers were deprived of their favorite channels for 9 long days. We certainly hope this will be the only blip in what had been until now, in my 6-year tenure, our perfect record of completing affiliate renewals with every other distributor in the U.S. or elsewhere without disruption to customers.", "Also notable in the quarter, our continued strategic moves to expand our consumer products business. In the past few weeks, the first toys and merchandise based on Nickelodeon's forthcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series debut on shelves at Toys \u2018R Us. The line of action figures, vehicles and more will be available in its entirety across all retailers this month in advance of the much-anticipated series premiere in September. Products for Nickelodeon's Winx Club have also begun to roll out and will continue to hit retail stores into the fall.", "Additionally, COMEDY CENTRAL recently launched COMEDY CENTRAL Enterprises, a new division that will unite and grow the network's ancillary revenue businesses, including consumer products, home videos, CDs and digital downloads, publishing and live touring for its roster of stand-up comedians.", "MTV is focused on programming innovation as it continues to diversify its slate with new scripted and reality series that's built on a strong base of returning hits. In the third quarter, those hits included Teen Mom, which was the #1 cable series in the quarter in the key 12-34 demo; Teen Wolf, which was up 6% year-on-year in the quarter and Jersey Shore spinoff, Snooki & JWOWW, which was #1 in its time period across television and the demo.", "In the new fiscal year, we'll start with a new season of Jersey Shore. In addition, MTV will introduce a range of reality and docu series, including Catfish, The Heights and Wait Till Next Year, as well as new scripted comedies, The Inbetweeners, Underemployed and Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous. In addition, Teen Wolf and Awkward were recently renewed for third seasons for double their original order of episodes.", "On COMEDY CENTRAL, Tosh.0 and Workaholics delivered solid performances in the third quarter, as each returned with new episodes. This fall, COMEDY CENTRAL hits the campaign trail hard with election coverage from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, both of which remained dominant in late night. In fact, The Daily Show is the #1 late-night show in all of television with adults 18 to 49. The Daily Show and Colbert are the only 2 late-night shows to grow their viewership in the demo this broadcast season, while Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert will remain with COMEDY CENTRAL, thanks to recent contract extensions. Beyond the campaign blitz, COMEDY CENTRAL will debut Daniel Tosh's new animated series, Brickleberry, along with new seasons of Tosh.0, South Park and Key & Peele this fall.", "Despite rating softness, Nickelodeon had success with new episodes of iCarly and SpongeBob SquarePants and the original TV movie, Rags, which reached 14 million total viewers. In the current quarter, the network is beginning to show momentum. Nickelodeon premiered a new SpongeBob special, Super Spongy Square Games, on July 22 with average 3.7 million total viewers. Following the episode, Nickelodeon gave fans a sneak peek in an upcoming series, You Gotta See This!, and the episode retained the overwhelming majority of the SpongeBob audience, including 99% of teens 9 to 14. A bright spot for Nickelodeon has been its new hit game show lineup. Figure It Out premiered in the third fiscal quarter with new episodes averaging 2.2 million total viewers. And Splatalot was added to the schedule in the current quarter, which is retaining 99% of the kids 6 to 11 audience from its Figure It Out lead-in. Splatalot is also showing solid time period gains over the months prior.", "In addition to new programming, we're aggressively fine-tuning the schedule to drive viewership, which is resulting in significant time period gains for a number of Nickelodeon's signature series. The recent SpongeBob special posted big gains in its time period versus a year ago and the month prior. Big Time Rush is averaging 2.2 million viewers per episode this quarter, up double digits in all key demos versus a year ago. And just last Saturday, the new -- the newest Fred movie, Camp Fred, averaged 3.5 million viewers and ranked as the #1 cable telecast for the week for teens 9 to 14.", "As we've said previously, Nickelodeon is debuting 650 new episodes of original programming for the upcoming broadcast season, including more than 130 from October to December. And just today, Nickelodeon is announcing a programming slate of 14 new series, TV movies and pilots, adding live-action and animation. As we have continually seen, fresh content drives renewed and expanded engagement, particularly among young viewers. Nickelodeon is now poised for an upsurge and soon. That includes the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on September 29; new episodes of animated series, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Kung Fu Panda and the Penguins of Madagascar; new episodes of live-action hits, including Big Time Rush, Victorious and the final season of iCarly; and great-event programming, including Worldwide Day of Play, The HALO Awards and a SpongeBob Christmas special.", "This fall, Nick at Nite will premiere See Dad Run, a new family comedy starring Scott Baio. Nick at Nite has gained recent momentum from Friends, which is seeing a 6% increase in ratings year-over-year. Also this fall, the NickMom nightly programming block, which is being enthusiastically received by advertisers, will debut on Nick Jr. with 4 new original series.", "BET continues to serve African-American audiences with a dynamic mix of scripted originals, including The Game and Let's Stay Together; big-event programming, including the BET Awards; and reliably strong unscripted series, including 106 & Park and Sunday Best. The Game and Let's Stay Together continue to anchor BET's primetime lineup as the #1 and #2 original sitcoms on cable. BET also has several original scripted and unscripted series debuting in the coming year, including sitcoms Second Generation Wayans, featuring the next generation of the Wayans family; and new late night series, Don't Sleep, hosted by journalist, T.J. Holmes.", "VH1 is successfully broadening its creative mission with a wide variety of programs and formats for the network's adult-stirred target audience. In the third quarter, VH1's primetime range were up 22%, marking its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year primetime growth in its targeted adult demo. Looking ahead, the network has a significant number of returning hit series, including Rehab with Dr. Drew, We Have Adopted Drew [ph], T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle and Pop Up Video.", "TV Land also has a lot to look forward to, with its hit tandem of Hot in Cleveland and Happily Divorced set to return with new episodes this fall. Just last month, Hot in Cleveland was picked up for syndication by local TV stations, serving 65% of the U.S., including 9 of the top 10 markets.", "SPIKE continues to broaden its audience, expanding and diversifying its original programming with a male-skewing general entertainment filter. In the third quarter, Season 2 of SPIKE's original hit series, Auction Hunters, attracted about 1.8 million viewers on average. The network also debuted the new series, American Digger, to an average 1.1 million viewers. In October, SPIKE will look to ink big ratings with the premiere of Tattoo Nightmares from Jersey Shore creators Sally Ann Salsano and Season 2 of the hit series Ink Master, hosted by Dave Navarro.", "CMT's standout performance in the third quarter came from the successful 2012 CMT Music Awards, which attracted nearly 3 million viewers. The network also continues to break through with new episodes of its hit series, My Big Redneck Vacation, and its first reality competition series, Redneck Island, which debuted in June.", "Moving onto international. We continue to see some softness in the international economic environment, particularly in Europe. However, strong affiliate growth from both digital distribution and organic growth, combined with strong cost management, offset lower advertising ancillary sales in the quarter.", "We continue to expand the regional success of our adult-focused business internationally, as ratings for COMEDY CENTRAL improved 27% across the board; with double-digit increases in markets, including the U.K, Germany, Spain, Poland, The Netherlands, Sweden and Hungary. The Paramount Channel performed very well in its first quarter on air and signed 120 advertisers in its first 3 months of operation despite tough economic conditions in Spain. Nickelodeon also saw ratings improved by about 5% internationally. And in an effort to drive popular content in new audiences around the world, MTV's Jersey Shore began MTV U.K.'s Geordie Shore, which is enjoying its highest-rated season so far and remains the highest-rated series in the network's history. The series is a bona fide international hit, attracting big audiences in all the other countries where it airs, particularly Spain, Australia and Ireland. Despite difficult economic times, we continue to invest. COMEDY CENTRAL is fast becoming our third global brand, and we plan on launching at least 5 additional Paramount Channels in 2013.", "Let's turn now to our Filmed Entertainment division. Despite a very different mix of films in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and the blockbuster-heavy comparable quarter last year, Paramount saw success with Titanic 3D, which has grossed more than $300 million in worldwide box office to date; and DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. Paramount remains on a great long-term creative path with a nimble approach to distribution, while it help give its releases maximum visibility, both in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the studio moved G.I. Joe: Retaliation out of this summer's crowded field to March 2013, allowing for a 3D conversion of the film and potential entry into the newly expanded Chinese marketplace. In addition to carefully calibrating its release strategy, Paramount continues to judiciously manage costs and effectively reduce overhead.", "To conclude, the Viacoms stood firm in the third quarter of our fiscal year, confronted challenges and again delivered value for shareholders. As we move forward into a fall season that we'll see an influx of new original content across our networks, we will continue to strengthen our audience connections, giving us to a strong path to drive ratings and revenue. We'll continue to put our theatrical releases in the best possible position to succeed at the box office by aggressively pursuing new opportunities as they arise. We will operate with an unflinching eye toward operational excellence, capturing efficiencies and managing costs. And as always, we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy.", "James W. Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our June quarter. Our 10-Q will be filed shortly.", "This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's June quarter exclude $11 million of discrete tax benefit.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion in the quarter. Domestic revenues declined 5%, and international revenues were down 7%. Foreign exchange had a 4-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues.", "Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 7% in the quarter. International advertising declined 18%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 6 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in parts of Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues decreased 1%, while international revenues increased 10%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 4 percentage points. The decline in domestic affiliate revenues reflects the greater availability of programming associated with the digital distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year, partially offset by great increases in the June quarter of this year. Excluding the impact from the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. International affiliate growth reflects revenues from digital distribution agreements, rate in subscriber increases and new channel launches.", "Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 14% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and Home Entertainment revenues. Media Networks' adjusted operating income of $934 million in the quarter decreased 10% as compared to the June quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 200 basis points versus the prior year. The decrease in margin was driven by the top line decline of 5%, partially offset by a 2% decrease in expenses.", "Within expenses, programming expense grew 6%, while SG&A expense declined 9%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense, savings realized from our 2011 restructuring, as well as lower advertising and promotion expense primarily related to the timing of award shows.", "Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 29% to $1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 52% to $283 million in the quarter. The decrease in theatrical revenues was principally due to lower revenues from the current quarter's releases. The June quarter of this year had 3 releases as compared to 4 releases in the June quarter of last year. Worldwide Home Entertainment revenues decreased 8% to $304 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter. The TV license fees declined 24% to $315 million. The decrease in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in network TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 44% to $104 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher digital revenues.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $46 million in the quarter as compared to income of $49 million last year. Moving below operating income, total company equity income from investments was $10 million in the quarter. The income in the quarter principally relates to our investment in EPIX. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 34.5%.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Jimmy. I'm going to focus my comments on our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year.", "In terms of our free cash flow for the quarter, we generated $197 million in operating free cash flow in the June quarter compared to $369 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally due to lower operating income and higher cash tax payments, partially offset by lower working cap utilization. The increase in cash taxes paid was due to the sunsetting of accelerated deductions related to film and TV production.", "As for our debt, for the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter-end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress on lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter-end.", "During the quarter, we took advantage of attractive rates in the public markets to maintain our leverage and our target level. We issued $300 million of 3.125% senior notes due in 2022, and an additional $100 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2015. In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.2 billion of debt and cap leases outstanding and $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. At June 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. The only financial covenant in our bank revolver requires that interest coverage for the most recent 4 fiscal quarters be at 3x. At the end of the quarter, our interest coverage was approximately 11x.", "In terms of our commitment to return capital to shareholders, between our buyback and our dividend programs, we returned a total of $833 million of capital back to our shareholders in June -- in the June quarter. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately 700 million of our stock in the September quarter. So for our fiscal year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion to our shareholders, which is a return on market cap of 14%.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. As for our affiliate revenue, we are confident in our ability to grow these revenues in light of our recent renewal with DIRECTV. In the September quarter, we expect that domestic affiliate revenue will grow double digits, taking into consideration both the impact from the DIRECTV rate increase and the blackout period. Additionally, domestic advertising in the September quarter will be impacted by the blackout. This will reduce the domestic advertising growth rate by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter.", "At Media Networks, we expect that programming expense will increase approximately 6% for the full year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to evolve our business model to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to enhance our margins.", "In the September quarter, Filmed Entertainment revenues will face difficult comparisons to last year's theatrical and home video performance of Transformers 3, as well as the theatrical performance of Captain America. However, the studio should generate profits comparable to the September quarter of last year, as it benefits from the carryover performance of prior quarter theatrical releases and the availability of film titles in the TV marketplace, as well as lower overhead costs.", "For 2012, we continue to forecast a book tax rate of 34.5%. As for our stock buyback program, we are on track to repurchase 2.8 billion for fiscal 2012.", "Looking ahead at the studio's slate and the development pipeline, in October, they'll release the fourth installment of Paranormal Activity. In November, the studio will release Flight, directed by Academy Award winner Robert Zemeckis and starring Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. In November, Paramount will be distributing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the Holidays, Paramount will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the bestselling book series.", "As we look into 2013, the studio will be releasing sequels to existing franchises, including G.I. Joe: Retaliation in March; and the next installment of Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams, in May, both of which will be in 3D. In June, they'll release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt. Looking at Paramount's developments, they have started production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe; and soon, they will begin production on the new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. Paramount is also in development on the Nickelodeon-branded Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, which is being produced by Michael Bay; as well as on a sequel to Anchorman, which will reunite the original cast.", "In summary, we remain focused on growing our businesses organically and using our free cash flow and the incremental capacity generated from our balance sheet to return capital to our shareholders. While we have experienced rating softness, we remain committed to investing in our brands and increasing the level of original programming on our networks in order to strengthen their competitive position. We continue to be encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands and franchises on both traditional and digital platforms. The ability to secure long-term growth in our affiliation agreement and the opportunity to grow our international profitability and to develop global franchises with consumer products appeal will enhance our long-term growth. We believe our focus on organic investment, combined with disciplined management of our core structure and an aggressive capital return program, will drive value for our shareholders over the long term.", "I want to thank you for listening. And now we'll turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nathanson from Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have one for Philippe and Tom and then one for Philippe. For the jump ball, you guys are pretty clear about giving us next quarter guidance on a affiliates see [ph] growth double digits. I wonder, knowing what you know now, all those you've done, looking to next fiscal year, do you think that double-digit run rate continues for the next fiscal year on domestics x digital? So could just comment about that for a second?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, Michael. We -- our guidance in general is high single-digit to low double-digit. We have confidence in that in the next fiscal year and beyond, based on agreements we've done, including the most recent one. We've tended to produce, on an annual basis, double digits, but we like to maintain our guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit. Of course, we've never delivered double digits. If the economy picks up, that'll also help us in that regard with more households subscribing to television.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "But I guess the run rate in the fourth quarter should be -- is there anything different about the rest of the -- the next few quarters after the fourth quarter run rate? That's the question.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We're well on track for very high single digits, low double digits on a pretty -- on a consistent basis, annualized. Again, with the quarterly fluctuations that can be associated with the digital distribution deals, which of course, are -- require revenue recognition in quarters, so that's the only aspect that creates variability quarter-to-quarter. But we have strong affiliate revenue growth ahead on both the core and -- plus the continuation of the digital distribution.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess one for you. You're pretty patient on this, but -- and I hate to ask you because it involves people's lives, but at what point does the question about ratings become an execution question and there's, perhaps, a change in leadership at the different networks? So at what point do you look at the personnel you have and say, \"Look, it's not about the -- it's about the decision-making and not the funding or the schedule.\"?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we're very -- obviously, very, very focused on ratings issues, and it does go through cycles. And we have great leaders in our company. We have made a lot of changes in the programming departments across several of our networks, and we continue to reinfuse talent, promote talent. We've gotten into a lot of new genres at several of our networks. And we also have reached out very significantly to the outside production community in a significant way. There's a very intensive focus on content. That's what we do. And we have a culture of accountability, and we have been implementing that at the many layers of the company. And I'm confident that -- we have steps we are taking. And if you look at Nickelodeon, for example, we're really now starting -- beginning to see the fruits of what we're doing, and we have a very strong lineup coming, coming forward. I should point out, by the way, that some of our Nickelodeon brands are doing extremely well, like Nick Jr. and Team Nick [ph], the ratings are up. If you look at Nickelodeon Family, we've been moving forward. And we will -- we're also looking at how we schedule shows and what networks that will appear in. And we are aggressively pursuing this at all levels.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, just on ad trends. The comment about you're seeing sequential improvement, is that fair to say that you're seeing sequential improvement even after adjusting for the BET Awards? I think last quarter, you said that you've got a 300- to 400-basis-point negative impact in the fiscal third quarter from the loss of both events. And I think you said it was evenly split, so I think somewhere around the 150 to 200 basis points should already be helping you by having that event in the fourth fiscal quarter. Are you still seeing improvement on top of that? And then just looking at the DIRECTV battle and how that played out, how has it impacted your view on either licensing to new kind of facilities-based distributors, such as Google, or even the emerging kind of over-the-top MVPDs? Does that become more important when you look at the battles that you've just had?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thanks for your questions, Rich. As far as the ad trends, the way I look at it is that the advertising impact of the blackout, the DIRECTV blackout for those 9 days, as Tom mentioned, that impact kind of offset the BET Awards. So they canceled each other out. So we see, right now, 1 month into the quarter, and we see sequential improvement taken both into account. But they basically cancel each other out, so core sequential improvement is what we see at the moment. Obviously, we have a couple more months to go in the quarter. As far as DIRECTV, as I said, this was not -- we hate to see a blackout occur. It's never -- shall never occur in all the other renewals we've concluded. We look at distribution in a holistic way. We value all of our distribution partnerships. We evaluate what we -- what content we put on new -- so-called new distribution, additional distribution. Mobile is also emerging. And we're fairly agnostic on what foreign distribution takes as long as it's added into our business and additive to all of our partners. But -- and we've managed that pretty well so far there, and we'll continue in the path we are on. The DIRECTV renewal, which is now history, it's behind us, doesn't impact our strategy as far as that goes.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "Just to follow up on the first question, given all the programming investments you've made, would you be significantly disappointed if you didn't drive advertising revenues up for fiscal '13, given what you talked about from an investment standpoint?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, obviously, that's subject to 2 things, right? One is the general economic conditions and how that impacts the general advertising market. But I certainly expect, given our intense focus and our investment program, I shall expect to see year-on-year ratings improvement at those networks which were deeply affected this year. And so I'm confident we'll get there and that will help drive advertising improvement.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "2, I guess, Philippe and Tom. Philippe, any update you can give us on the percentage of Nickelodeon viewing that's coming from Netflix would be interesting. But mostly, interested in any updated thoughts you have on the investor concern around kids' viewing movies online and how that might impact the company. And for Tom, you've been working hard to manage SG&A and offset the impact of some ratings softness this year. I think margins are coming at about flat for fiscal '12. So for cable networks, I guess, one, is that right? Is that more to do in the cost side? Or has the low-hanging fruit been captured?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Doug. I'll take the Nick question. The Nick viewing on Netflix has been pretty stable. As we've talked about before, there's really no significant difference, and I've spoken before about my perception of that impact. We clearly have to be where consumers are and where they are. That's why we do -- we are rolling out apps with our -- in partnership with several of our distributors. You'll see more of that in the fall. We already have it at -- with distributors like FiOS, you'll see it in Time Warner Cable, you'll see it at some of our distributors, so that our audiences can view the on-demand content, they\u2019ll be able to view Linear in the home. Eventually, when we have measurement [ph] and other issues sorted out, they'll be able to watch it out of the home on various devices. So yes, we're very anxious to deliver content to our audiences wherever they want to view it. And I think we're -- we'll soon be able to monetize more effectively the viewing on these other devices.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Yes, Doug. We're very focused on -- of course, as you guys know, I mean, the reason our margins haven't grown more than they have this year is because of the rating shortfalls and -- which has decreased the revenue growth that we have projected. Once we get the revenue to grow back on track, I think you'll get very good dramatic expansion in our margin that was continuing right up through second quarter of this year. And we feel pretty confident about that. And we've got plans in place, and we've begun process and even made investments in our systems across the company, which are -- will begin to pay dividends in the next quarter and certainly in '13 and '14. So we feel pretty good about being able to both control the cost growth factor and really find new efficiencies throughout the P&L in operations.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'm sure you didn't expect the first 3 questions head this way, but we're talking about 10% affiliate revenue ad growth and margin expansion next year as we sit here today.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to ask 2 questions: maybe one on the Nick Upfront and the other on EPIX. On EPIX, can you just sort of comment on the DIRECTV terms or at least what the EPIX situation? I think the announcement was that they have the option to carry EPIX. Maybe add just a little more detail on whether you expect them to or not. And then you have Netflix. I think the over-the-top exclusivity expires this month or very shortly. What's your expectation there? Do you expect ending up going out and shopping that to other online providers? And give us a sense for what you think the opportunity is. And just on the Nick Upfront, it's such a big part of next year. You guys had the view that Nielsen had a lot to do with the ratings declines. I'm just wondering if you were able to sort of guarantee quite a bit of ratings improvement, at least flat or maybe even up, looking out because you start to lap that panel change and how that might have fit in to the overall Upfront. Just trying to get a sense for whether Nick can grow next year or if the Upfront results, given the ratings declines last year set you backward, that's going to be pretty tough?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thanks, Ben. So starting with your EPIX questions. As far as the DIRECTV options, I have a 1-year option on pre-negotiated terms to take EPIX, and the decision will be their's over the next year. We obviously think that EPIX is a highly desirable service with great movies, but it really will be up to them. And as far as the Netflix exclusivity, which is over-the-top exclusivity that is, which is expiring soon, we have -- we're not beginning discussions. We've had discussions with several parties. EPIX is doing very well. Netflix has been a great partner, great partner for EPIX, great partner for Viacom in general. And EPIX certainly drives a value for Netflix. We expect to have an announcement on the outcome of these discussions within the next couple of weeks. So you should expect the announcement from EPIX very shortly on that point. As far as the Nickelodeon Upfront, our advertisers have been very supportive of Nickelodeon. Clearly, in terms of ratings fold in the Upfront, we looked at it based on the new reality that Nickelodeon has. If the ratings will improve, there will be opportunities for us, and it's got a market.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David Bank from RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess kind of a follow-up on Rich's question from before that if I look at the contract, I think, you've given in the past about both the BET Awards as well as the Kids' Choice Awards, it looks like it was something like a 350-ish-kind-of-basis-point headwind in the quarter you just reported, where you reported it down 7. And so yes, there is a 150-basis-point headwind from the impact of direct on advertising. But if you're not seeing a material -- an acceleration of kind of a couple of hundred basis points, if my math is right, then the core looks like it's decelerating. And if it's decelerating, is that a function of ratings or market? Could you just give a little bit more color around that? And maybe my math is wrong in the first place, so please correct it, if this needs.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, I'm not quite sure I followed where you were going with that. But in terms of -- about half of the decrement in ad sales in the quarter that was just completed related to the difference in the award shows in the quarter. So that part is correct. As I mentioned earlier, the -- in this quarter that we're in, since the BET Awards were not in the comparable quarter, that's an uplift. That uplift is offset by the advertising loss during the 9 days of the DIRECTV blackout. So we're -- on a comparison with last year, we're back to apples-to-apples, if you will.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Clearly, David, the ratings are creating some headwinds in terms of the advertising sales progress. And I mean, it's good -- the good news is that we're starting to see some really good performance. We're rebuilding Nickelodeon half-hour by half-hour. And as we continue to do that, that ratings performance will drive the revenue growth back to where it needs to be.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can I just ask one follow-up as to -- in trying to understand this a little better too. What is the lag that you see between ratings impact and revenue on the way down and, hopefully, on the way up? What kind of lag do you think we see there?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Right now, I mean, when you have a significant ratings shortfall, as we experienced in Nickelodeon, that, obviously, eliminates inventory we have available to sell, and you get into mako [ph] situation. That creates an inability to take advantage of the cash market. On the flip side, as that improves, that will just open up inventory for us to monetize. So we'll be able to see a pretty good short-term impact as ratings improve.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Many of the networks, David, are positioned so that as soon we get the ratings, we'll be able to draw down on the liability banking and create revenue right away. So we'll come back very quickly when the ratings come back.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet from Citi.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, I just had 2 quick questions. The first is, it doesn't -- I remember back in like the '06, '09 time period, we were all very nervous about Paramount and sort of was it going to flip into negative operating income. For a couple years now, and I think based on what you said on the call, you generated sort of $300 million-ish of operating income pretty consistently. Because I think we all struggle with how to model that, I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that is something that is structural, that sort of change the cost structure of Paramount as opposed to just the vagaries of how well or poorly your films do? And my second question is on the ratings. If things go according to plan, what month do you think we can begin to see ratings improve if the investments work out?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Jason, as far as Paramount goes, yes, we've made very significant structural changes year after year at Paramount. And as I've said many times in meetings with investors, that's money in the bank. And as you've correctly pointed out, we're, obviously, subject to the vagaries of the film business. But we've been very [indiscernible] and very disciplined on that front as well. We -- as I've talked about before, we've modified the strategy -- the film strategy of Paramount to focus on a more limited number of releases and focusing on franchises and our brands, and that reduces the risk. We very much look at it as a risk-reward situation. And that's why our ROI has been pretty steady at Paramount, and we will endeavor to keep it that way despite the vagaries of the studio business and some of the dynamics that you all know about, such as the decrease in DVD revenue marketplace, somewhat offset by digital revenues coming in. As far as predicting months, what month or what week or whatever rating quarter, we can't -- we don't do that. What we do is we focus on building, on the programs that work, expanding them, adding new programs, and you can never predict the magnitude of a hit when it comes. When it comes, and you take a lot of it best, when it comes, you just ride it. And we, obviously, hope to improve it. We're certainly making an investment. We -- as I mentioned before, we have intensified our focus on programming talent. And our long history in the business shows that, that will -- that, will bear fruit over time. But we're not able to predict days, weeks or particular months, but the magnitude of the new programs coming on gives us reason to believe we're going to see improvement as we head into the new fiscal year.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And we've already seen improvement. As we said before, half-hour by half-hour that the ink show block that Philippe referred on Nickelodeon is doing very well and beginning to put us back on track there. And we really have to rebuild it half-hour by half-hour to take market share back from the competitors. And we're doing that, and we're going to continue to do that.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. First, with the DIRECTV deal concluded, can you remind us what percentage of your affiliate revenues are really locked up now for the next few years? And then just a second question on the ad market in the international advertising. I guess, how should think about that going into fiscal Q4? Is the weakness in Europe getting any worse, or it should be about the same sort of trends? And domestically, if you could just touch on how scatter -- what you're seeing in scatter in July?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Alexia, let's take your questions in order. As far as affiliate revenues, the way we have conducted our renewables over the last several years, we never have more than 20% of our revenues that are up for renewal in any given year. In a year where we have a huge distributor like DIRECTV, that's kind of the high watermark, where it's close to 20%. We just went through that. It'll be a lower percentage of our revenue in the next couple of years, which was your question. So we have a nice portfolio of affiliate revenue. That's why we're able to so confidently predict the affiliate revenue growth as we go forward. We don't have a situation where we have overwhelming amount of our revenue up in a given year. As far as international advertising trends in the quarter, we expect to see some improvement in our performance in this quarter compared to the quarter we just completed. There were a lot of events that we had in prior year that didn't replicate. And in any kind of these events, very often that we look to do events that are profitable. So it's not all a revenue story. We look to have profitable events. So even though the ad revenue, they go down because of the absence of an event, it doesn't impact the profitability to that same degree because there are costs associated, obviously, with that. And that's why we've been able to grow the margins and the profitability, in addition to the other steps we're taking in the international. As far as the current scatter market, it's pretty healthy, which is, as Tom said, as our rates improve, we can take advantage of it. Scatter pricing scatter-over-scatter right now is up year-on-year, and it's significantly up over upfront. So as Tom said, we'll be able to take advantage as our ratings improve.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial.", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I have a question on international margins. I suspect that some of the past several quarters, the international margin expansion did upset some of the advertising revenue shortfall domestically. So Philippe, you mentioned there are some issues developing in Western Europe. Do you think that's threatening the magnitude of margin expansion that you spoke about before and going into 2013?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "No, we're actually getting very -- I've said before that we were going to have margin in excess of 20% in the 2013 fiscal year. We're actually very close to that now, so we're actually quite confident that our margins will go into the 20%-plus territory in the new year. We've been launching a lot of new channels. So even in a tough environment, as we launch channels, we will get more revenues. We've been focused on efficiencies around the world. And we have new revenue opportunities. The affiliate revenue growth story internationally is also a really good story. So we talk a lot about domestic affiliate revenues, but the international affiliate revenue growth story is a good one. And, yes, there are some markets that are still healthy even within Europe, where we've actually had a -- the U.K. economy has been challenged. Our advertising performance in the U.K., which is a really important market, has been strong. Obviously, in Southern Europe, it's a different story right now. So we will drive our margins forward even in a difficult environment in our international business.", "Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And if I may ask a quick follow-up. How would you explain -- how should we think about the difference in growth rates between what your international networks deliver and, let's say, Discovery or News Corp.? Is it just geographies and that they're exposed to faster growing markets like Brazil and Eastern Europe and Russia and Asia, and you're more --and you're heavier in Western Europe?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, it's a combination of factors. We've emphasized growing some of our more adult brands like COMEDY CENTRAL, like the Paramount Channels. There are dollars available in the adult demo that we haven't been able to tap through our music and kids brands, Nickelodeon and MTV, primarily. So we have an opportunity to get at that adult demo, which will drive it. And then also, you're quite right, we are looking to expand our presence in strong developing markets like Latin America. We have a big presence in India, which is actually below the line, as you know, because it's a joint venture. We're very committed to growing that market and that -- we expect that to create significant value for Viacom as we go forward. And you'll soon hear about some other initiatives that we have in other parts of the world. So yes, the world presents a lot of opportunity for us for the long term. And I believe we will have a very significant value creation in our international networks business over the next several years.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And some of those competitors are enjoying the benefit of having started new channels in those markets earlier. And as Philippe mentioned in his remarks, COMEDY CENTRAL is becoming our third global-branded network, and Paramount Channel is right behind it with 5 new channels going in 2013. As those channels get up, get revenue and get rolling, they're going to have a significant margin -- impact, and I think our revenues will enjoy the growth that comes from that.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "There's a rapid ramp-up on those brands. Obviously, a startup in the first year, but they pretty rapidly turn to profitability.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And I think that our competitors are seeing some of that in their P&L results.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Alan Gould from Evercore Partners.", "Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to get back to the ratings situation again. Philippe, when the ratings became soft 3 quarters ago, you called it a short-term ratings problem. And you opened the call saying they\u2019re cyclical rating softness. You said Nick's poised for an upsurge soon. The July ratings are down. The ratings are down, not only at Nick, but really across SPIKE, MTV, COMEDY and TV Land as well. You're spending the dollars, you're adding new episodes, you say there's been some programming management changes. What gives you the confidence that the ratings will turn? And if these ratings declines don't subside, are you confident that you'll be able to continue repurchasing stock at this rate?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, first of all, the month of July did include the 9-day DIRECTV blackout. That it did impact our ratings. And we've compared the ratings before the blackout and after, and we've come back. So looking at July in isolation is not a good way to look at it. So if you take that impact away, we are, in fact, seeing improvement in some of our core networks. And as I said, it takes a while to create new programming. Shoot it, cast that, do all those things, it doesn't happen in 2 weeks. So we've done a lot of the work. The shows are going to be released over the next several months. And we expect to see a positive impact. And as far as the repurchase program, we are committed to it. We have been able, despite these issues that you point out, to purchase at the pace that we talked about earlier in the year, the $2.8 billion in repurchase. As Tom pointed out, when you add that to the dividend, that's a 14% return on our capitalization. And we continue to generate strong free cash flow. We continue to drive the dynamics, the margins of our business, at Paramount and the Media Networks. We will come back on the -- both the ratings and advertising front. And we will continue to return capital to shareholders over the long term year-after-year. That is our promise to our shareholders.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our June quarter earnings call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jimmy Barge, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.

Redstone", "Thank you, Jim. Thank you, all, for being with us this morning. I'm really pleased to join our leadership team to report Viacom's financial results. Our shareholders once more again benefit from our relentless focus on producing great content, operating efficiently and maximizing returns to shareholders in every single environment. As our industry continues to ever more rapidly evolve, this obsessive focus will separate Viacom from its peers and help ensure our continued leadership and many, many years in our success.", "The fact of the matter is that Viacom has always been in the reinvention business. Our cable networks continue to innovate and strengthen their connections with new fans on new programs year after year. And our motion picture operations continue to bring innovative filmed entertainment to more people on more screens in more places than ever before.", "Of course, the man at the center of this success is my friend Philippe Dauman. Philippe provides extraordinary leadership to Viacom's outstanding management team, and in fact, he has been at my side, creating all that I have built over the past 25 years. And I know, I'm confident he will continue to provide the same strategic insight and operating skill that will ensure Viacom's success for many, many years to come. He, in fact, is my most trusted advisor who understands my vision and has the eye as well as [ph] ability to see it through.", "I'm proud to turn the call over to my forever friend, Viacom's CEO. I often refer to him as a genius and as the wisest man I ever met, and the reason is that Philippe has operated Viacom in a truly fantastically successful manner. So here \u2013 it's yours, Philippe, take it over.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Sumner. I really appreciate it, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.", "We know that many of you on the call today, like many of us here at Viacom, live, work or have loved ones in areas enduring the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy. We hope that you and your families were able to weather the storm and return to the normal rhythm of life that we too often take for granted. For those still trying to rebuild, we are with you. Viacom remains committed to recovery efforts, whether it's our corporate support of the American Red Cross and other relief organizations or the initiatives of our individual brands, including MTV's Restore the Shore textathon tonight. And we thank our employees who continue to support the recovery through the company and their own personal efforts.", "Let's move into the discussion of our September quarter and Viacom's 2012 fiscal year. It was a year in which the company achieved success in several key areas of strategic focus even amidst challenges. Our diverse brands continue to engage and entertain audiences on every platform throughout the world. We're investing consistently in content to ensure that those brands remain vibrant, strong and well positioned to attract greater viewership as audiences evolve and measurement improves. Those investments, along with key organizational changes, are yielding progress at Nickelodeon and our other networks.", "We're aggressively pursuing every sensible opportunity to monetize our Media Networks, both through advertising and distribution. For the fiscal year, we generated double-digit growth in affiliate revenue as we captured substantial value for our content with existing and emerging distributors alike. We see fees from traditional and emerging distribution platforms as an important and consistent area of growth well into the future.", "We're also creating ever-greater opportunities for our content internationally, where we're fortifying the position of our core brands in Nickelodeon and MTV, expanding with COMEDY and the Paramount Channel and building our consumer products business. This is another big opportunity for future growth where Viacom is extremely well positioned. In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures enters fiscal 2013 with a remarkable slate, which will see the return of key tentpole franchises such as Star Trek and the launch of new ones, including World War Z.", "Even as we increase investment for content on every screen and add programming talent to our organization, we've enhanced operational efficiency, kept a tight rein on costs, maintained a strong balance sheet and continued to generate excess free cash flow. Viacom was able to drive bottom line growth and significant increases in earnings per share for both the quarter and full year, and we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "This morning, I will briefly review our financial results for the quarter and the full year and provide highlights from our divisions. Tom and Jimmy will provide more detail, and then we'll gladly take your questions.", "Let's begin with the results. Viacom's revenues in the fourth quarter declined 17% to $3.36 billion with revenues in our Media Networks segment flat and revenues in our Filmed Entertainment segment down 39%, due to a different mix and lower number of releases compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. Our fiscal 2012 revenues declined 7% as a result of the decline in advertising sales in Media Networks and theatrical and home entertainment revenues and Filmed Entertainment. Media Networks revenues rose 1% for the full year, driven by an 11% increase in affiliate revenues.", "In the September quarter, Viacom's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $1.21. For fiscal 2012, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.21 per diluted share, an 11% gain over the prior year period. Our operating free cash flow was nearly $2.4 billion for the fiscal year.", "Fueled by our cash generation, we repurchased $700 million in stock in the September quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. The company repurchased a total of $2.8 billion in stock for the full fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, Viacom also increased its quarterly dividend 10% to $0.275 per share. As we begin fiscal 2013, we are on track to buy back at least $2.5 billion of stock this year. In the current quarter, we plan to purchase $700 million of our stock. We have consistently ranked among the top of our peers in returning capital to shareholders.", "Let's take a look now at our -- at how our divisions performed in the quarter and the full year. At our Media Networks, we continue to be completely focused, completely focused on creating great content for every screen. We continue to increase our investment in programming to roll out more originals, including more new episodes of hit shows and more new franchises. In fact, a number of our core networks, including MTV, Nickelodeon, COMEDY CENTRAL, SPIKE and TV Land, are showing sequential improvement in the current quarter over our fiscal fourth quarter.", "With any network portfolio, it is inevitable that some networks will be on the rise while others will be in reinvention. To be sure, the entire broadcast and cable industry is at an inflection point. Time-shifted viewing is growing more prevalent, and our networks are stretching the window for fan engagement with our shows as a result. In the fourth quarter, ratings for MTV's 10 Spot, for example, increased 34% when including DVR playback through 3 days. COMEDY CENTRAL's Tosh.0 nearly doubles its audience when including DVR playback through 3 days.", "Content consumption across platforms is also growing rapidly and exceeding our ability to measure it by a greater margin than ever. We know that our audiences are viewing more video in more places than ever, but lack of comprehensive measurement remains a significant roadblock to monetization. However, we are confident that we have the right strategic mix to grow ratings in the short term by investing in original content, enhancing and empowering our creative teams, applying our deep audience insights, maximizing scheduling opportunities across screens and leveraging our unrivaled strength in social media. This will, in turn, allow us to restore more robust ad revenues as the year progresses to enhance our otherwise strong financial performance.", "Across our Media Networks, we are investing in the future and making the strategic decisions, particularly in the areas of programming development, marketing and distribution that will position us as a leader in a truly convergent multi-platform world, where expanded viewership is accurately accounted for on all screens. We are not waiting for business to change. We are changing how we do business.", "Earlier this week, for example, MTV announced a new addition to its creative leadership team, adding a proven hit maker as its President of Programming. This follows on the heels of Nickelodeon's moves to create centralized west coast leadership for all of its content teams and recruit new talent, particularly in animation, as it rolls out an ambitious development slate and expands across platforms. COMEDY CENTRAL is increasing original programming by 55% in the current fiscal year as it installs digital as a function in every group across the network, for an even more holistic approach to content development across platforms.", "Our advertising revenues were down 6% domestically and 7% worldwide for the quarter. We were able to achieve modest sequential improvement in our domestic advertising revenue performance despite the 10-day blackout of our channels on DIRECTV, which effectively canceled out the benefit of the BET Awards moving into the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, ad revenues declined 4% domestically and 5% worldwide. In the current quarter, we're seeing pricing up in the mid-teens over the upfront and scatter-versus-scatter pricing up in the mid-single-digits year-over-year. Advertiser demand for our content is there, and we are in a position to quickly monetize ratings improvement as it takes hold.", "In distribution, affiliate revenues increased 12% domestically and 11% worldwide in the fourth quarter. For the full year, affiliate revenues increased to 10% domestically and 11% worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed several distribution agreements in which we secured significant rate increases.", "As previously noted, we struck a long-term agreement with DIRECTV, securing a healthy rate of increase. We also entered into a deal to provide EPIX films for the Amazon Prime subscription streaming service. In the current quarter, we renewed and expanded our agreement with Hulu, adding Tr3s at a limited offering from Nickelodeon to the Hulu Plus subscription service. We also made our content available for download to own through the Nook Video service.", "Additionally, we increased distribution with existing affiliates, which launched TV Land and MTV 2 in HD in the fourth quarter. In the current quarter, we significantly expanded our TV Everywhere partnerships with distributors by rolling out our video-on-demand websites for ATT U-Verse, Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV subscribers.", "Despite some rating softness, MTV continues to connect with its core 12- to 34-year-old demo, an audience with whom it scores 4 of the top 15 cable series more than any other network, including Teen Mom, Awkward, Snooki & JWOWW and Teen Wolf. The network remained #1 in the demo among ad-supported cable networks in its critical 10 Spot programming slot. In the current quarter, MTV has a solid mix of returning hits and new originals in its 10 Spot lineup, anchored by Jersey Shore and Teen Mom 2. In its final season to date, Jersey Shore has been the #1 cable telecast on Thursdays in its demo. Leading into the series finale on December 20, MTV will air a week of countdown programming celebrating the event.", "Teen Mom 2 returned on Monday this week, a new night from which the hit series will jump-start the network's lineup each week and drew 3.4 million total viewers, up from the final season of Teen Mom and outpacing the Teen Mom 2 season finale. MTV will air seasons 3 and 4 of Teen Mom 2 back-to-back for the first time, giving fans new episodes of the series through April of 2013. Teen Mom 2 will serve as a platform to launch several new series debuting through next quarter, including Catfish, a reality look at identity and truth in the social media age, which premiered Monday to an average audience of 2.7 million total viewers and ranked as the highest-rated 11 p.m. show premier in MTV history.", "We've spoken at length about our efforts to reinvigorate Nickelodeon, and I'm pleased to report that those efforts are yielding results, with viewership stabilizing and a continued infusion of new original programming coming to air. By addressing ratings issues, half hour by half hour, Nick has made improvements across the schedule and is now flat to up in several day parts, including preschool.", "The network has reclaimed its leadership of Saturday mornings among kids 2 to 11, thanks to new episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants and the long-awaited debut of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which ranked as the highest-rated animated launch on the network since 2009. For 4 straight weeks, SpongeBob has stopped all of television and Ninja Turtles has won its time period by double digits with the critical 2 to 11 audience. The Ninja Turtles consumer products line has also been selling very well with our partner Playmates managing out-of-stock situations for action figures and selling out additional items rapidly. We expect brisk sales to continue.", "From SpongeBob to Avatar, our history has shown that top animated programs typically continue to build audiences over time. So the strength of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the gate, in addition to the success of its consumer products line and the anticipation for the forthcoming live-action feature from Paramount, give us great encouragement that Nickelodeon has a lasting and lucrative hit on its hands.", "Additionally, new seasons of returning programs, including iCarly, Victorious and Big Time Rush, had strong premieres in the fourth quarter and continue to perform well in the current quarter. The iCarly one-hour series finale airs Thanksgiving weekend and is among a greater number of event programs throughout the current quarter, including Christmas specials from SpongeBob and Fairly OddParents. Event programming is a consistent and critical ratings driver for Nickelodeon, and you'll see more and more of it from the network.", "On COMEDY CENTRAL, new episodes of Tosh.0 and Workaholics performed well with the network's young male audience in the fourth quarter. COMEDY CENTRAL's newest hit, Key & Peele, solidified its place in the cultural zeitgeist. And in late night, Jon and Stephen again proved to be strong as they held leadership in late night across all of television with men 18 to 34. As I mentioned earlier, COMEDY is increasing its original programming significantly, including the launch of 6 new series in the first half of the 2013 calendar year.", "VH1 continued its ratings rise as the network increased its viewership in primetime by 19% among adults 18 to 49 in the fourth quarter. Monday nights on VH1 remain particularly strong with women viewers. During the summer, VH1 was the #1 network with women 18 to 49 for 13 consecutive weeks, thanks to hits Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta and Single Ladies. The network is building on its momentum with the introduction of a new Friday night comedy block in January, which will feature The Jenny McCarthy Show and the return of Best Week Ever. Hit series Mob Wives and La La's Full Court Life return with new seasons in January as well.", "BET saw success in the fourth quarter with its gospel original series, SUNDAY BEST, which has its best season to date, and 106 & Park, which the network has given a refreshed look and new hosts. In the current quarter, the BET Hip Hop Awards drew 3.1 million viewers, and BET's new reality series, Keyshia & Daniel: Family First, successfully premiered with 2.9 million viewers. In the current quarter, BET will air the 2012 Soul Train Awards later this month. And next quarter, we'll see the return of the network's hit originals, The Game and Let's Stay Together.", "TV Land had a solid quarter with total day ratings up 5% year-over-year at the network's core 25 to 54 demo. In the current quarter, TV Land will look to build on that momentum with the return of Hot In Cleveland and Happily Divorced later this month.", "As SPIKE prepares for its much-anticipated debut of Bellator mixed martial arts in January, it continues to build out its lineup of originals. Returning series Auction Hunters and Bar Rescue showed momentum with Bar Rescue achieving double-digit ratings gains over its first season.

In the current quarter, the season 2 premiere of Redneck Island last Saturday attracted more than 1.4 million viewers and stands as the highest-rated season premiere in CMT history.", "Moving now to international. Our international Media Networks improved both its operating income and margins in the fourth quarter despite the volatile economic environment abroad, particularly in Europe. We continue to drive strong growth in affiliate sales through organic growth, new channel launches and, to a lesser extent than prior quarters, digital distribution. Our continued strength in affiliate sales internationally, combined with significant cost management, have enabled Viacom International Media Networks to mitigate softness in advertising and ancillary sales due to the economic factors mentioned earlier.", "In fiscal 2012, we made great progress in driving the reach and success of our adults-focused business abroad, a key priority for international. Ratings at COMEDY CENTRAL increased nearly 30% internationally for the full year, and this month saw the launch of COMEDY across several markets in Southeast Asia. The launch marks a major milestone in our effort to establish COMEDY as our third truly global brand alongside MTV and Nickelodeon.", "In the current quarter, fans around the world cast a record-breaking 184 million votes to decide the winners of last Sunday's 2012 MTV European Music Awards, and early results indicate that the broadcast grew its estimated TV reach in Europe by 15% over last year's strong ratings. We are on track to achieve our goal of 20% plus margins in our international networks in fiscal 2013.", "Finally, let's take a look at our Filmed Entertainment segment. The fourth quarter closed a fiscal year in which Paramount Pictures took reasoned and decisive action to manage its release schedule and give its films maximum global visibility in theaters, even as it aggressively managed costs behind the screen, all of which resulted in higher profitability. The studio continues to demonstrate significant long-term progress in enhancing its margins.", "In our fiscal 2013, Paramount has as diverse and promising a slate as we've seen from any studio in recent years, including star-driven tentpoles, prestige films and the type of highly targeted, high-margin releases it pioneered with the Paranormal Activity franchise. Indeed, Paranormal Activity returned to theaters in the current quarter with its fourth installment, which has grossed more than $50 million to-date at the box office and set the stage for a fifth Paranormal next Halloween.", "Paramount also released Flight, which earned rave reviews for the performance of 2-time Oscar winner, Denzel Washington, and has had 2 strong weekends at the box office for cumulative gross of more than $50 million. The studio has an additional 5 films hitting theaters through the end of the quarter, including: a Tom Cruise action vehicle, Jack Reacher; The Guilt Trip, starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand; David Chase's Not Fade Away; and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians.", "To wrap up, Viacom delivered significant value for shareholders in fiscal 2012. Our consistent investment in content will continue as we enter a new year, and our audiences will see it on every screen, on our television channels around the globe, on the web, on tablets and mobile devices and on the big screens in theaters worldwide.", "As we deepen engagement and drive ratings, we'll continue to connect marketers with our audiences and advance distribution through innovative and fruitful partnerships. At the box office, Paramount Pictures will serve movie-going audiences with a deep and diverse slate that will drive theatrical revenue through the year. Our entire organization will continue to strive toward creative excellence, operational excellence and effective cost management. And as a result, we will deliver on our commitment to continue to maximize free cash flow and return capital to shareholders.", "Thank you again for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jimmy.", "James W. Barge", "Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a chance to review our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our September quarter. Our 10-K will be filed shortly.", "This morning, I'm going to take you through our operating results in more detail. My remarks will focus on adjusted results from continuing operations. Adjusted results for this year's September quarter excludes $17 million of discrete tax benefit. Last year's September quarter adjusted results excluded restructuring charges of $130 million on a pretax basis and $90 million after tax, as well as $52 million of discrete tax benefit.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. In our Media Networks segment, revenues of $2.3 billion in the quarter were in line with the prior year. Domestic revenues increased 1%, and international revenues were down 6%. Foreign exchange had a 4 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues.", "Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance. As Philippe mentioned, domestic advertising revenues were down 6% in the quarter. International advertising declined 14%, with foreign exchange losses impacting the growth rate by 5 percentage points. The decline in international ad sales was primarily due to fewer production and promotional events in the quarter, as well as softness in Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 12% while international revenues were up 3%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the international growth rate by 5 percentage points. Excluding the impact of the digital distribution agreement, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter.  International affiliate growth reflects revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate in subscriber increases.", "Worldwide ancillary revenues declined 4% in the quarter, primarily due to lower consumer product licensing and home entertainment revenues.", "Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Within expenses, the programming expense grew 9% while SG&A expense declined 7%. The decrease in SG&A expense was primarily due to lower accrued incentive-based compensation expense and savings realized from our 2011 restructuring.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income of $933 million in the quarter was down 3% as compared to the September quarter of last year. The operating margin of 41% decreased approximately 100 basis points compared to the prior year.", "Now moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues in the quarter were down 39% to $1.1 billion. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 83% to $131 million in the quarter. As anticipated, the studio faced difficult comparison to the September quarter of last year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, as well as the release in the quarter of Captain America: The First Avenger. Worldwide home entertainment revenues decreased 32% to $345 million in the quarter, primarily due to the mix of titles released in the quarter, including a difficult comparison to last year's release of Transformers 3.", "TV license fees increased 19% to $464 million. The increase in TV license fees in the quarter principally reflects the number and mix of titles available in the pay TV and foreign syndication marketplaces. Ancillary revenues increased 21% to $147 million in the quarter due to higher digital revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $195 million in the quarter as compared to income of $185 million last year.", "Now moving below operating income, total company equity losses from investments were $13 million in the quarter. Losses in the quarter principally relate our investment in EPIX. On a full year basis, EPIX was profitable.", "The reported tax rate in the quarter was 31%. The reported rate was favorably impacted by $17 million of discrete tax benefits. For fiscal year 2012, the adjusted effective tax rate was 34.0%.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thank you, Jimmy. Today I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I will also talk about the seasonal factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year.", "Now turning to the full year results. Media Networks generated revenue of $9.2 billion and adjusted operating income of $3.9 billion. Affiliate revenues grew 11% for the year, and advertising revenue declined 5%. Media Networks' margins of 42% increased 20 basis points over the prior year. The international part of our Media Networks business generated approximately $270 million of profitability for the year and achieved high-teens operating margins. Filmed Entertainment generated revenues of $4.8 billion and adjusted operating income of $325 million. This translates to an operating margin of 7%. As Philippe mentioned, we generated full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.21 and $2.4 billion in operating free cash flow.", "Also, we continue to be aggressive in returning capital to our shareholders. For the full year, we repurchased 60 million of our shares for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 billion. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $3.4 billion of capital back to our shareholders, which is a return-on-market capitalization of approximately 14%. If you look back to when we started our buyback program 2 years ago, we had 609 million shares outstanding. Since then, we have repurchased a total of 121 million of our shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $5.6 billion, which brings our shares outstanding to 502 million as of November 7.", "Now moving on to our debt. For the most part, it's fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 5%. This compares to an average cost of 5.8% 12 months ago. So we continue to make great progress in lowering our average cost of debt. To the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 40 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.", "In terms of leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $848 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2x. At September 30, our $2.1 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Last week, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility that increased the size from $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion and extended the maturity 2 years to November of 2017.  This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with significant financial flexibility for the next 5 years.", "Now I'd like to talk about some of the factors impacting our 2013 fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, for fiscal 2013, we continue to see growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate, given that the recognition on some of our digital agreements is tied to product availability. Accordingly, in the December quarter, we expect that the reported affiliate revenue growth will be in the low single digits, which is a combination of lower digital revenues and double-digit growth in traditional revenues.", "For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the high single digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air, growth will be weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve or enhance our margins.", "At Filmed Entertainment, in the December quarter, we anticipate a greater loss than in the prior year. This is primarily due to difficult comparisons in the home entertainment marketplace. The prior year benefited from carryover revenues from Transformers 3, as well as releases in the quarter, which included Super 8 and Captain America. However, the studio should see healthy growth in profits in the back half of the fiscal year as they benefit from the availabilities of titles in TV and home entertainment marketplaces.", "For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. We expect cash taxes to be similar to book taxes for the year.", "As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we plan to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the December quarter, and we expect to repurchase at least $2.5 billion for fiscal 2013.", "Looking ahead at the studio slate and development pipeline, on November 21, Paramount will be disturbing DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians. For the holidays, the studio will release the comedy, Guilt Trip on December 19, starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen and which is produced by Lorne Michaels. And on December 21, they will release Jack Reacher, which stars Tom Cruise and is based on the best-selling book series. In addition, Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film Not Fade Away from David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos.", "As we look into 2013, we have a number of 3D releases. In January, the studio will release Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which stars Jeremy Renner, and in March, they will release G.I. Joe: Retaliation. The next installment of Star Trek, which is directed by J.J. Abrams, follows in May, and in June, Paramount will release World War Z, which stars Brad Pitt.", "Now looking at Paramount's development, they are currently in production on Noah, which is directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Russell Crowe, as well as a new installment to the Jack Ryan series, with Chris Pine in the lead role. The studio is also in development on the Michael Bay-directed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and on a SpongeBob movie. They are planning a fourth installment of Transformers, as well as a fifth installment of our low-budget Paranormal Activity franchise. If you look at our 4 Paranormal films, which have released to date, they have cost only $27 million to produce and have generated over $700 million in worldwide box office.", "In summary, we continue to focus on organic investment, disciplined management of our cost structure and returning capital to our shareholders. At Media Networks, we remain committed to strengthening our brands through increased investment, as well as by growing the level of original programming on our networks across all platforms and devices. And we look forward to the day when total content consumption is more accurately measured. At Paramount, we have developed several tentpole franchises and are excited about our upcoming slate and pipeline. We continue to seek ways to reduce our capital commitment in the business in order to enhance our margins, as well as our returns. And we are committed to aggressively returning capital to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs.", "I want to thank you for listening. And now, operator, we'll turn the call over to the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony DiClemente, Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I think investors are, in some ways, pleasantly surprised by the lack of correlation between the level of some of your ratings declines in the past quarter and the level of your domestic advertising decline, which hasn't been as dramatic of a decline. So just wondering if, maybe Tom and Philippe, if you could remind us of some of the reasons why ratings haven't correlated as directly with advertising trends, why advertising hasn't quite been as bad as linear ratings declines. And you guys have been more aggressive on TV Everywhere, particularly with current release windows than your peers. And so, clearly, that's probably one of the reasons they don't correlate. And, Tom, you mentioned the measurement, and you look forward to a day that those digital viewers can be measured more accurately. So any update on measurement in that way for TV Everywhere would also be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I'll start, Anthony. Look, there's never been a linear correlation between ratings and ad sales in discrete periods of time. Naturally, over the long term, you have to rebuild your ratings. Where we focus on is working very closely with our major marketing partners. We do get a pickup from the C3 measurement in many cases, and so it's a question of mix. We have the ability to shift units from DR to paid advertising. So we operate at all times to maximize the available ad dollars. The good news for us is that as ad  -- as ratings improve, we can pretty quickly monetize those improved ratings because of the under-delivery that we have experienced over the period of weakness that is starting to lift. As far as TV Everywhere and measurement, we believe that in the long term, in order for our whole industry to succeed, we have to provide consumers, and particularly our young audiences, with the content they want on the gadgets and platforms and the places they want it. And we're going to do it in a way that intelligently manages the windows and work with our marketers to ensure that we monetize that viewing, a part of it is measurement. And we are working with Nielsen and others to ensure that, that measurement improves over time. And I'm convinced that we're going to see gradual improvement of that; not as fast as we would like, but it will improve. And in the meantime, we are demonstrating to our major marketers the kind of additional viewing we are getting on the content that they are in partnership with us on. And as they understand that, that cements the relationship we have with them and, going back to the beginning of your question, allows us to maximize our advertising revenues even in the face of weak ratings in some of our networks.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then my understanding was that you and Nielsen and some of your peers are working on mobile device measurement in the home. That's in beta for Nielsen. And there was some talk that it would be operational perhaps the early part of the calendar year. Is that possible? Like can you give us a specific update on that?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Yes. There are those -- there are conversations on that, and that is one timeline that's on the table. Whether that will be met is up in the air. I can't comment on how aggressive or unaggressive that timeline might be. But, Anthony, we also look forward to the day -- Facebook and Google actually bill based on delivered impressions, and I think there's opportunities down the road for traditional media to begin to go down that road. And that would be an exciting new day. Add that to the possibility of dynamic commercial insertion, where commercials are inserted at the time when the content is consumed, which in today's day and age, based on video-on-demand and all the technologies that are available to deliver our content discretely to a consumer, you got to get very excited about that, that power of that concept and that delivery capability. When is that going to take place? That's over the next 12 to 24 months that those technologies really begin to hit the marketplace very quickly, and that changes a lot of the dynamics in the advertising marketplace and the content measurement marketplace. So we're real excited about that, because we know our content is being consumed aggressively by the younger audiences that we deliver across many devices where measurement isn't completely captured.", "Operator", "We'll go next Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have 2 for Philippe. Philippe, firstly, over the years, you've talked a bit about forward trends. You gave us scatter versus scatter pricing on -- and how you guys capitalize on ratings game better. But do you want to talk a bit about what you see in the current fourth quarter, if it's accelerating, decelerating or staying the same? And if not, why won't you comment about the fourth quarter? And then secondly, in the past, I asked you about changes of programming talent, and you guys did. You brought Susanne Daniels in. What do you think she brings to the job and what vision -- what direction you think she'll take MTV?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Michael, as far as the current quarter, we're continuing to look to sequential improvement in our ad revenues. We're still climbing back up. I don't expect that this quarter will see us get into positive territory, but we'll see improvement. And we are going to strive very hard to get back into positive territory as the year progresses and continue to improve from there. And as I mentioned earlier, there is going to be a correlation to the continued trend in ratings improvement. As far as Susanne Daniels, we're very excited. We've had our eye on her for a long time, and we're very pleased that she has committed to coming with us and devoting her total energy to the exciting programming we have in place. And she will bring with her, and you'll see announcements in the near future, some additional talent who will bring to bear more development in both the reality and scripted areas. So we've got a good pipeline now, and this will only turbo charge it. And likewise, we have continued to add talent across many other networks. I talked about Nickelodeon, talked about how we changed the structure of the organization, but we've also infused the Nickelodeon organization with new outside talent. From Disney, we recently have made a significant hire from Disney and from other places. So we are centrally focused at our company on bringing in great programming talent, developing more series and different genres across all of our networks. Because if we do that, that drives everything else.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A couple for Tom. Tom, can give us any more details on what needs to happen execution-wise to preserve cable network margins in fiscal '13? You said that you'd be able to offset advertising pressure and programming cost investment?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Yes. I mean, Doug, we're working all the time to try and drive down the net investment that we do to kind of fill out the program mix around everything else, the making what goes on in the screen. That includes everything from the financial areas to the production areas that uplink onto satellites and deliver our signals around the world. Technology has begun to benefit us in that regard in terms of cost savings and in terms of the number of folks we have do it. We've made some significant investments, both in the financial side and the distribution side, to basically drive our cost efficiencies there. Those have happened over the last several years. And they're beginning to pay dividends, and I expect them to pay dividends into the next couple of years. So we're pretty excited about that, and that gives us confidence that we'll be able to save money in other areas of the company.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And am I right in thinking that you'll get further compensation from Disney for the stronger-than-expected performance of The Avengers and that you did not accrue any of that benefit in fiscal '13?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "That is correct, and that movie did very well for them and will also benefit us.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So you'll book that on a cash basis? When would that be...", "Thomas E. Dooley", "We took it on when they report the receipts to us, and we have a good estimate as to what that number might be.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So I'm right that -- sorry, that wasn't during fiscal '12, right?", "James W. Barge", "It'll be in '13.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "In '13, yes. Okay.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And some will flow over into '14 when [indiscernible] has the results flow in.", "Operator", "We'll go to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "On an organic basis, it looks like your ad revenue, domestically, down 6%, was the worst you experienced during the year. I think if you organically trace back the last few quarters, you were down 3.5%, a little less than 1% and 3% in the past 3 quarters. How do you think about the network and channel kind of put and take when you look at that down 6% in the quarter? What were the key pluses within that number? What were the key minuses from a network standpoint really driving those results? And then just, Tom, you mentioned, I think, that you expected the non-digital piece of affiliate fee to be up double digits in fiscal Q1. When you look at the full year, if you excluded digital from all of fiscal 2013, could you actually get to double digits for the traditional portion of your affiliate fee?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Rich, Philippe. As far as the components of the ad revenue, it's what we've been talking about. I mean, obviously, Nickelodeon -- the softness in Nickelodeon ratings in the quarter hit us pretty hard. We had some ratings softness in some of our other networks, which contributed to it. That's why it's so important that we turn that around. And as we look forward, we should see improvement. And we like to look forward, and I feel better about the steps that we have taken to build a foundation for growth in the future. As far as affiliate revenues, as we talked about, we enjoy strong so-called traditional affiliate revenues, as well as an increment of digital revenues. We don't break that down precisely. We project the usual year-after-year high single-digit to low double-digit growth. As I've said before, I expect that in this 2013, it's likely, on domestic affiliate revenue growth, that we will hit the mark we did last year. Last year, we did 10% growth in domestic affiliate revenues. I think that's what we're likely to do in fiscal 2013, and that will include very high growth in -- within that range in traditional affiliate revenues and continued development of new sources of revenues on the digital side.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up. When you talk about Nickelodeon, I think everyone's aware that Nickelodeon was down sharply in the quarter, given its ratings challenges. But when you look across your other networks, were there actually any of your key networks that actually grew ad revenue year-over-year or were down substantially less than the reported 6%? Just trying to get a feel for where you really were outperforming that overall down 6%.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Sure. When you look at networks like BET and COMEDY, TV Land improving, there's a number of our networks that performed better.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "It's a wide range of outcomes. Some of them performed as good as high-teens, mid-teens and then some were low single digits and then some were negatives. So it was pretty widely spread.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I was curious if you could talk about the current volumes you're experiencing in the scatter marketplace, how that's pacing versus last year same period. And then separately, there was talk at one point about Sony Pictures and you brother [ph] CBS at one point, but I'm curious, when we think about an asset like that, that maybe comes up for sale, how do you think about whether or not something of that scale makes sense to pursue versus just continuing to return cash to shareholders?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Brian, could you just repeat the first part of the second question.", "James Bombassei", "Yes, we didn't hear you. It was garbled.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Sorry, it was a question around Sony Pictures as an example of a large-scale M&A opportunity that may be in the market at some point. The question is really just if a large asset like that were, in fact, available, how you would think about the trade-off between such a transaction versus returning capital.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, as I've said before, in looking at the universe of available acquisitions out there, I continue to not see any large scale acquisition that makes sense for Viacom. We have a lot to do in growing organically. We have the brands. We have the resources. We have a lot of opportunities. We are living in a world where the media business is transitioning. We are extremely well positioned to grow in that transition because we have a deeper understanding of the young audiences that are driving that transition than any media group out there. So we have opportunities to grow with them on multiple platforms. We have opportunities to grow internationally. We may have some discrete small-priced M&A opportunities that are almost operational investments, particularly in the international arena where it makes sense. But we just have so much opportunity that's more -- that creates more value than large M&A, which, as you know, has a number of pitfalls generally associated with them. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. As far as the scatter marketplace with our marketing clients, there is demand out there. We don't have a demand issue on our networks. We've -- what we've had, we've experienced is a supply issue, meaning ratings. So we are engaging in self-help. We are going to create the supply, create the inventory, so that we can capture the demand that we have out there so that we can take the demand, take the dollars in. And that's why it's so important for us to focus on building our programming and building our ratings, scheduling segment by scheduling segment, network by network.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. Wanted to ask a little bit more about the tone of the ad market. To what degree were the results in the quarter affected by -- do you think by the Olympics or the election? And to what extent are -- is the current quarter affected by fiscal cliff fears or Hurricane Sandy? A little bit of color on any categories that are weak and strong. It would seem that auto sales are resilient and maybe kids movie release slate is weak.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Look, we're not going to look for external excuses on our ad sales. There are a lot of factors that go in and out. A lot of people have talked about them. Last quarter, of course, Olympics affected the media industry. There are always concerns of one kind or another. Again, we're going to focus on what we can control. We're going to build our ratings at Nickelodeon, at MTV, every one -- at BET, COMEDY CENTRAL, every one of our networks. There's money out there. And whatever happens in the world, we are going to succeed, deliver bottom line results whatever the economic conditions are out there.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Well, if I could ask a separate question. You have great sales of the Mutant Ninja license merchandise. I was wondering if you could talk about the materiality of that and the degree to which we might see that affect the December quarter versus the September quarter.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "The consumer product initiative, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, will enhance our bottom line. It will start to rebuild our consumer product and ancillary sales, which have, of course, suffered some declines, not just because of the macroeconomic environment, but also because DVD sales, which were a component of our television business, have been declining along with everything else. But we've -- we're getting to the point of bottoming out on that, and the consumer product franchise Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will continue to build the bottom line. It's not significantly material. But it's nice, steady business, high-margin business that we will grow, not just in the U.S. but significantly internationally. So we will build on that. We think the Turtles are a long-term franchise to add to SpongeBob and iCarly and Dora, and we have others to layer onto that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "I guess my first question on the film studio. Can you talk about how you ended up with what appears to be a major void on your summer schedule? I know some of that has to do with your decision to move G.I. Joe. So in hindsight, I'm trying to get a sense of how -- what other positions might have contributed to that, understanding that comparisons were a major factor in the studio's results. But any color on that would be helpful. I also have a follow-up question.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Sure, Tuna. Yes, we aim at Paramount to develop and distribute approximately 15 pictures a year. And as we develop those, we look for the optimal scheduling. We look at what our competitors are doing. If a schedule gets overly crowded, we don't want to beat our heads against the wall. We try to find a place where we can optimize the results and bottom line of our films. As far as the G.I. Joe, which you specifically mentioned, we also saw an opportunity there to go into 3D, which opens up for us several significant international markets. And along with a good release day, we think that will enhance that bottom line for that particular movie.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research", "Okay. Separately, with regard to your ad revenue, you've talked about how you're striving to mitigate that in all of the programming investments. Seem like some of them is starting to pay off. But there's been some concerns about the level of your ad loads across your channels, which are trending higher, seems like most of your peers. Wondering how much of a concern that could be in terms of is that a short-term measure? Or you view that as a temporary lever that you can pull? Or was pretty much you expect that that's pretty much going to be the normalized levels even when your ratings start to improve? So any color on that and what you're hearing would be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Look, we -- it's just of the many tools that any network has. And we look at ad loads, we look at how much promotional and tour [ph] we put on, we try to optimize it all. You have to promote your new shows, and we look at it network by network. And it's a decision that our network leaders look at, and you try to get the optimal mix. So you'll see that vary from year-to-year and from network to network any given year.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And they've been reduced a lot since that story was written. And the ultimate way to reduce the ad loads and the necessity for ad loads, where we're just trying to fulfill the commitments we've made to our advertisers, is to improve the ratings around the shows which those ads run in. So I mean, that is the goal. As Philippe articulated before, we're well on our way to achieving that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.", "Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Philippe, there's this fear out there that MTV is broken. And so I was just wondering if you can comment on how you can, I guess, fix this like you're fixing Nickelodeon.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "It is not broken. It's highly successful. Just this past Monday, we -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Catfish, which we premiered at 11:00, which, as you know, for MTV is part of their primetime, was the highest-rated launch in MTV history. So MTV is very healthy indeed. We have a great development pipeline, and we have just added one of the major talents in our business, addressing young audiences, Susanne Daniels. So I have no concern about MTV's vitality as we go forward.", "Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then my second question, just addressing another fear, is that there may be a possibility that your share buyback falls below $2.5 billion if ratings trends don't improve, specifically at MTV. But is it safe...", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We will buy at least $2.5 billion of our stock in 2013.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple questions. On your guidance for the growth in programming expense in fiscal 2013, do you think those dollars skew a bit more toward MTV this coming year, given your change in management there and given the programming and ratings there? I'm trying to get a sense if you feel the heavy lifting behind Nickelodeon is sort of behind you, and you're beginning to see the benefits of those dollars spent, but still investments are needed in other networks.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We look -- we're investing in all of our networks across the board. There's also, Alexia, a mix issue in some of our networks we have, who license third-party programming. Those licenses come to an end. Those dollars can be reinvested, in some cases, without increasing the programming spend. That makes money available within that average of programming expense growth, money available for some of the networks that need more incremental investments. Certainly, no secret that Nickelodeon has been one of those networks that we're investing in. A lot of it, as Tom indicated in his remarks, is, in terms of the impact you will see in the first half of this 2013 year, front-end loaded to reflect all the programming we've been putting on that we talked about. So we look at all the situations. And we are fortunate to have a portfolio of networks, and we can do what is necessary for all of our networks. And we do invest, as appropriate, in each of our networks, because that is the lifeblood of our company. We do not hold back on any network to the extent it needs more program development.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Alexia, we also -- we amortize our programming very aggressively and, certainly in contrast to some of our peers, on an accelerated basis. So as we ratchet up to a level, we have a point in time where it does increase to a level. But once it's at that level, it's constantly providing a new source of programming investment because it's amortized so quickly. So I think that's a bit of a distinction between us and, from what I understand, some of our competitors do.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And can you just remind us if you have renewals, both traditional and digital, in fiscal '13?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, we don't publicize our renewals. We prefer, except when it's -- we're forced to go public, as we did in the DIRECTV dispute. We prefer to do business with our partners confidentially, quietly. And what we can tell you is that we're very confident that we can continue to achieve greater growth in affiliate revenues as we discussed earlier.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our March quarter. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.

These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner M. Redstone", "[Audio Gap]", "You to Viacom's Second Quarter Conference Call. Once again, our outstanding team delivered on its proven strategy to grow our business and drive value for shareholders. Today, Viacom's brands are better than ever. Our creative operative is booming. We are making smart, sustainable use of exciting new distribution measures and technologies.", "At the heart of this effort is Viacom's outstanding executive team led by its incomparable CEO, Philippe Dauman. His expertise and wisdom continue to guide Viacom's success and fuel our ability to deliver the outstanding returns our shareholders have come to expect.", "Now it is my pleasure to introduce my friend, my colleague, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss the second quarter of Viacom's 2013 fiscal year.", "Our results for the March quarter were highlighted by our return to positive advertising revenue growth driven by continued ratings' momentum at our Media Networks. Nickelodeon posted solid year-over-year gains, with ratings up 7% and up 11% at Nick at Nite, in their respective key demos, marking the strongest ratings growth we've seen from Nick in 2 years. We're achieving ratings growth and revenue improvement through increased investment in content. We continue to invest in new original programming, diversified creative formats and marquee and emerging talent, both on and behind our screens.", "Even as we invested in on-air programming, Nickelodeon took the leading edge of a sweeping effort across Viacom to reinvent how we deliver content and connect with fans. In March, Nickelodeon launched the Nick app for the iPad, the first of several dynamic apps to come from our individual brands. Nick app will debut for the iPhone later this quarter. And a number of our other brands will launch standalone apps this summer.", "In our Filmed Entertainment segment, Paramount expanded another strong film franchise with the successful launch of G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Not only did the film perform well at the global box office, it also provided another successful example of how the studio is creative, nimble and opportunistic in optimizing release timing and formats in order to maximize profits.", "Tom and Wade will detail the results in a moment, but let me quickly recap Viacom's financial performance for the March quarter. Revenues declined 6% to $3.135 billion, operating income decreased 9% to $847 million and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom declined to $481 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.96 per diluted share.", "We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and we again repurchased $700 million of stock in the quarter under our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to repurchase an additional $700 million of stock in the current quarter as well. Given our operating performance and cash flow expectations, we now expect to repurchase a total of $2.8 billion of stock this fiscal year. Since we initiated the program in October 2010, we've repurchased close to $7 billion of our stock at an average price of under $48 per share. In our board meeting later this month, we will also review our dividend rate, as we usually do around this time of the year.", "Our Media Networks segment had a solid quarter, with revenue up 2%. Advertising revenue also grew 2%, thanks to ratings improvement at our networks and strong demand. Growth represents an 8-point sequential improvement from the December quarter. We expect to achieve further sequential improvement in advertising revenue growth in the current quarter.", "Affiliate revenue grew 2% in the quarter. Similar to the previous quarter, our core domestic affiliate revenue grew in the low-double-digit range, but the overall affiliate line was moderated by the timing of content availability for digital distribution partners in the quarter. We expect total domestic affiliate growth of 10% for the full fiscal year. We are in constructive discussions with several parties, including Netflix, concerning digital distribution of various portions of our rich portfolio of content beyond the expiration of our Netflix agreement later this month. We continue to see such distribution to be a growing and complementary avenue for our affiliate business.", "As I said earlier, our strategy is strong, sustained investment in original, wholly-owned content. We firmly believe that if we fuel the creative engines that drive our brands, we will continue to create hits that resonate with diverse audiences, keep audiences deeply engaged with our networks and increase viewership on new and emerging platforms as well as drive value for our marketing and distribution partners.", "While we invest in programming, we're also investing in the future of content itself. We believe that apps are a critical piece of that future. The recently-launched Nick app is the first of several brand apps we're rolling out this year. Our guiding principle is that the app opportunity is greater than just online video. Apps give us the opportunity to deliver a total brand experience to fans. The Nick app, for example, is an interactive playground that offers not only short-form and full-episode video but also a rich offering of games, media and other features that allow fans to connect with Nick stars in the network's new Nick Studio 10 afternoon block of live programming. And advertisers are taking notice, with several studio clients on-board at launch and other marketers poised to join.", "MTV is taking a similar approach with its forthcoming app which will feature its hit programming but also deep social TV integrations and original video content. And beyond the core brand apps, we continue to launch apps for individual franchises, like The Colbert Report and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, extending the engagement that many of our shows have built with fans beyond traditional TV.", "Additionally, our core brand apps drive value for our distribution partnerships and reinforce the subscription model through TV Everywhere functionality. Our authenticated apps and websites are currently available to more than 50 million pay TV subscribers with distributors including DIRECTV, Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS, AT&T U-verse and more.", "Moving into programming highlights, I'm going to focus on 3 of our networks.", "Things are going very well at Nickelodeon. The network had a great quarter in which its ratings built each month, finishing March up 21% year-over-year on its way to a 7% overall ratings gain among kids 2 to 11 for the quarter. A highlight was the 2013 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, which grew ratings over last year in the U.S. and continued its expansion into a true global franchise, with ratings up double digits in markets including the U.K., Brazil and Spain. In the current quarter so far, ratings at Nick are up 9%. We are gratified by the progress the network has made and the creative and strategic execution its team has undertaken to get back on top.", "Nickelodeon has now completed the process of consolidating its West Coast development hub, allowing for greater consistency of creative vision and sharing of talent and resources across its programming teams. Throughout this quarter and beyond, Nick will bring a significant amount of new programming to the air, giving it ample time to establish new hits in advance of the critical holiday season for marketers.", "Nickelodeon also continues to be strategic in maintaining demographic balance in its audience. The Kids' Choice Awards are a great example. After seeing an exodus of boys among the viewership of last year's show, the network loaded the 2013 show with talent having greater appeal for young boys, including host and Transformers star Josh Duhamel. As a result, ratings were up 19% with boys 2 to 11, the key driver of the show's overall ratings growth.", "Nickelodeon rebounded with preschool audiences in the March quarter, thanks in part to the successful launch of Peter Rabbit, and continues to invest in preschool content. The network is also sharpening its focus on older girls, particularly with the upcoming launch of Sam and Cat in June, starring iCarly's Jennette McCurdy and Victorious' Ariana Grande.", "Finally, animation remains a key focus for Nickelodeon. We're bringing more animated programming to the screen, including the new hit Monsters vs. Aliens; our newest series Sanjay and Craig launching later this month; the upcoming Rabbids and Breadwinners; and new episodes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Legend of Korra and SpongeBob.", "At MTV, the network continues to earn its reputation as the cultural home of the millennial generation. Connecting with millennials means staying a step ahead of them, and the network continues to accelerate its development timelines to accommodate an audience that constantly demands fresh, original content. That means shorter windows between seasons of the network's biggest hits. Season 2 of Catfish, for example, will debut in June. Awkward just successfully debuted a new season and will return with another season in the fall. And Teen Wolf will return with a summer run beginning in June before debuting another new season early in 2014.", "MTV rounds out its schedule with highly-repeatable shows like Ridiculousness and True Life that generate great ratings relative to their low cost. Girl Code is a new series in that mold that is performing well and strengthening MTV's Tuesday night female block. Efficient shows like this allow us to place expanded orders of our big hits and bring more new originals to air without dramatically growing our programming spend.", "In the March quarter, hits Catfish and Teen Mom 2 continued to perform very well and the network also once again showed its ability to mine great stories from vibrant subcultures. In April, the network scored a solid hit with the 2013 MTV Movie Awards, which increased ratings 22% over last year. MTV shrewdly moved the show from June to April this year to take advantage of the additional advertising dollars in the market ahead of the summer blockbuster season and to steer clear of the NBA Playoffs.", "Moving forward, MTV continues to bring more and more original programming to air to create a balanced weekly schedule for audiences and advertisers. In fiscal 2013, the network is bringing 17 new series and 15 returning series to air.", "Currently, we're in a pivotal time in the network's development year. Last week, MTV unveiled upcoming programming to advertisers at its annual upfront presentation in New York. In July, the network will hold its summer pilot screening, the first pilot screening that will entirely reflect projects brought to MTV by its new development team.", "Turning to BET. The network is launching an exciting new initiative around the BET Awards this summer to bring its brand to life, live and in person for its audiences. BET Experience will take over Downtown Los Angeles for 3 days in late June with an ambitious lineup that includes the debut of Beyonc\u00e9's world tour at the STAPLES Center, along with a host of musical performances by acts including R. Kelly and Miguel, a festival of BET-produced films, panel discussions on issues affecting the BET audience and a massive outdoor festival. The BET Experience marks the first time that AEG has activated all of its Downtown Los Angeles facilities at once. And the events will fuel 16 hours of live on-air and online programming for the network. Ticket sales for the BET Experience are already outpacing our projections. It's a big undertaking with a solid business rationale.", "BET has been consistently successful in commanding healthy spending from advertisers seeking to reach African-American audiences. But a live event like the BET Experience allows the network to access different marketing budgets and sell unique sponsorships. The BET Experience has already locked up several blue-chip advertisers.", "Finally, let's move on to our Filmed Entertainment segment. Although revenues from our theatrical releases in the March quarter exceeded those of the comparable quarter in 2012, revenue declined 20% due to lower carryover revenues in the quarter, compared to the carryover revenues from Mission: Impossible last year. But the big story was the successful premiere of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which is a great example of Paramount's flexible approach to release scheduling in order to maximize profit. G.I. Joe was initially slated for release in June 2012, but the studio made the call to move the film to March 2013 to avoid an overcrowded summer tentpole season, allow for a conversion to 3D and improve its chances for distribution in China. Additional 3D revenue helped drive the film's stellar worldwide box office of nearly $350 million to date, including nearly $50 million in China, increasing its strong international haul.", "In the current quarter, Pain & Gain kicked off Paramount's summer slate at #1, to be followed by the release of Star Trek Into Darkness later this month and World War Z in June. And Paramount continues to drive value for Viacom beyond the big screen. We recently marked the 1-year anniversary of the Paramount Channel in Spain, which continues to grow ratings and set the stage for the launch of Paramount Channels in additional international markets this year. Paramount also announced plans to return to television production, with its first project to be a potential Beverly Hills Cop series, in partnership with Sony TV.", "Paramount has a rich library of film franchises to mine for television, as well as the capacity to develop original television productions, and we see a great opportunity here.", "To wrap up. We will seek to build on our ratings and revenue improvement by investing in more original content. We're returning hit shows to air in faster cycles and bringing new shows to our screens in greater numbers. And we'll continue to be aggressive in unlocking further value for our shows through multiplatform viewers. We are looking to the future by evolving the brand experience through apps. Our principal revenue streams are now growing in tandem at a healthy pace. As we grow our business and our content offering across screens, we remain committed to delivering value and returning capital to our shareholders.", "Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results of our March quarter are available on our website.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 2% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues up 3% and international revenues down 4%. Foreign exchange had a 1 percentage point unfavorable impact on international revenues. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "Domestic advertising revenues were up 2% in the quarter and international advertising revenues were up 1%. The improvement in international advertising was driven by strength in the U.K., partially offset by softness in parts of continental Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 3%, while international revenues were down 4%. Excluding the impact from the timing of a product available under digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew low double digits. International revenues were down due to lower digital distribution revenue related to the timing of product availability, which was partially offset by growth in revenues from new channel launches, as well as rate and subscriber increases.", "Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 8% while SG&A expense was up 1%. Media Networks' adjusted operating income was down 2%. And the adjusted operating income margin was 39%, down approximately 170 basis points compared with the prior year. The margin decline was driven by a 5% increase in expenses, partially offset by the top line growth of 2%.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues declined 20% in the quarter principally due to lower theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 15% primarily due to lower carryover revenues as a result of last year's December quarter release of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. This was partially offset by higher revenues from the current quarter's releases of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 38%, reflecting lower revenues from both the current quarter releases as well as from carryover titles. These declines are primarily due to fewer titles in the current year, as compared with the prior year.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $65 million in the quarter, as compared to $115 million last quarter. The results principally reflect lower theatrical profits, partially offset by savings from lower overhead costs.", "Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $9 million in the quarter. The increase relates to higher deferred compensation costs as a result of the appreciation in our stock price. Excluding the deferred compensation costs, corporate expenses were flat in the quarter.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Wade. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover seasonal factors that are impacting the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year.", "In the quarter, we generated $700 million in operating free cash flow compared to $869 million last year. We continued to maximize our free cash flow efficiency, converting over 80% of operating income into cash flow in the quarter. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to an unfavorable working capital variance and lower operating income, partially offset by lower cash taxes. The unfavorable working capital variance was principally impacted by the timing and mix of theatrical and home video receipts, which last year included Mission: Impossible IV.", "Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we issued $300 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2023 and $250 million of 4.875% senior debentures due in 2043.", "Given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, we have been able to access the capital markets, secure long-term funding at very attractive rates. Over the past couple of years, we have issued approximately $5 billion of public debt at an average rate of 3.6% with an average maturity of approximately 16 years. Additionally, we either called or tendered for approximately $2 billion of previously-outstanding notes. These transactions, taken together, have lowered our overall average cost of debt by approximately 150 basis points.", "In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 35 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at the quarter end.", "As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of debt in capital leases outstanding and $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalent. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.4x. At March 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the March quarter as we returned a total of $700 million of capital back to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $700 million of our stock in the June quarter, which means that in the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2.5 billion to shareholders through our share buyback and dividend programs. Since starting the current share buyback and dividend program in September 2010, we have returned over $8 billion to our shareholders, and over 75% of that return was from excess cash flows from operations.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of our 2013 fiscal year. For fiscal 2013, we anticipate affiliate revenue growth of 10%. However, quarterly affiliate revenue growth will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to some of our digital agreements which are tied to product availability. For the full year, we continue to expect high-single-digit growth rates for Media Networks' programming expense. Given the timing of shows coming on the air, growth is weighted to the first half of the year. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.", "At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about our upcoming summer tentpole releases, including Star Trek and World War Z. We expect growth in profits to be weighted to the September quarter as the studio benefits from the carryover performance of our summer tentpoles as well as the availability of titles in home entertainment marketplace.", "For 2013, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic-versus-international profitability mix.", "In terms of cash taxes. Due to the retroactive reenactment of provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense, we now anticipate that cash taxes will be significantly lower than book taxes for fiscal 2013. Accordingly, we will see strong growth in free cash flow for the year.", "As for our stock buyback program, as Philippe mentioned, we now expect to repurchase $2.8 billion for fiscal 2013.", "To wrap up, our increased investment in original programming has started to yield results in both terms of ratings and our ad sales performance. We are also investing in our organization and our infrastructure in order to engage and monetize our audiences as they increasingly embrace consumption of our content on digital platforms. And we continue to drive efficiencies throughout our company in order to enhance our margins. The current attractive capital market interest rate environment has enabled us to lower our average cost of debt while, at the same time, extend our average maturity.", "In addition, our continued focus on organic investment in driving operating efficiencies throughout our organization has contributed to strong free cash flow generation. These factors have enabled us to consistently and aggressively return capital back to our shareholders, which we believe will drive value now and into the future.", "Now we'll turn the call over to your questions.", "James Bombassei", "Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Wieser.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I was wondering, what metrics are you selling marketing partnerships on when it comes to your apps? It's -- I guess you're going to bring this out before, I guess, some of the more advanced say Nielson [ph] ratings are going to be more widely being used. And separately, I guess I have a tax question. I was just wondering, which retroactive adjustments is it that are being applied? And wondering if you could dimensionalize it and whether you think it's going to be an ongoing benefit.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "As far as the marketing with apps, we'll -- marketers love to have multiplatform engagement with our consumers. So it just expands our offering, creates some opportunities. There's -- the apps have additional content, both video and games, and other opportunities to highlight our marketers' initiatives. So it's just continuing our deeper engagement on the consumer side and bringing up our marketing partners with us into that deeper engagement. As far as the tax question...", "Thomas E. Dooley", "From the tax point of view, Brian, given that it's a retroactive tax adjustment, it will have a benefit to us that we hadn't been forecasting of around $400 million. So it's a significant benefit but it's a catch-up for almost 2 years of not having that benefit in place. Once it's caught up, the benefit goes away.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A couple for Philippe, on Netflix. Philippe, I wanted to hear from you, how would you characterize the inability to not renew or extend the deal with Netflix? Was it a change of philosophy on your side? Was it simply price? And then how confident are you of your ability to find money out there to replace that hole? And could it -- might be coming from people that we haven't seen show up yet? So that's where we are.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Michael, as I indicated in my remarks, we're still in discussions with Netflix. Remember, our deal does not expire until later this month. So we are in discussions. They -- with them and with others. Obviously, we don't want to announce specifics until we have new dealer deals to reveal to you. As Netflix indicated in its call last week, it has interest in different kinds of content, some exclusive. We're open to licensing content, some of it on an exclusive basis, some of it on a nonexclusive basis, and with a view to -- overall to maximizing our revenues. We continue to see the digital distribution arena as a growing opportunity and one that will be complementary to what we do. And it's just growing the pie over time. Now from a -- because of -- the kind of recognition, it appears choppy, but when we look at it overall, a full year basis, we have enough visibility to tell you that we are going to meet our 10% growth in affiliate revenue forecast that we've given to you in previous quarters.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on that a little bit, Philippe, not so much the -- whether you're going to increase SVOD revenue, but what's the right long-term strategy for selling programming, with Netflix wanting more exclusive program sales? But I imagine you have a desire to foster competition in the SVOD sector. Are you going to be open to doing exclusive program sales knowing that it could hurt other SVOD players? Or do you have a desire to only do nonexclusive sales?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, again, there -- as you point out, there is increasing competition in that distribution arena. And we are doing business with several players today. We have content up on Amazon, on Hulu. There are discussions going -- that are taking place with others. And by the way, this is a global phenomenon, and there are other players in individual countries that are emerging. We have -- we are fortunate enough that we own a lot of compelling content. We have deep libraries with many thousands of titles. So we look at what our distribution partners are looking for. Their strategies are different, their strategies evolve. And we'll work with them to help them improve their business in a way that's consistent with maximizing our relationships with all distributors, not just the SVOD but our long-term affiliates and others. So we balance our different considerations. We look at what's good for our brands. There's a lot of marketing value to some of the content that we have in the SVOD arena, particularly with shows that have more seasons to come. So there are a number of factors. And we work with all of our partners in all aspects of distribution to come up with win-win situations.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next questions from Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. When you look at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you launched it last year, and I think there was, I think, among investors, a little bit of skepticism in your ability to reboot this franchise. And it seems like it's done pretty well in the network. And I -- it's like you're -- on iPad, you're like the #1 paid app. And I'm just kind of curious, why do you think this franchise has resonated so well? And what do you do from here to keep building its brand and making more out of it as you look out over the next couple of years?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Richard, thanks for bringing it up. We couldn't be happier with the way this franchise has been rebooted. And it has a long life ahead of it. The -- you have a lot of young dads who remember the old series fondly. And the execution on the new animated series on Nickelodeon is really great. It's visually beautiful, and it echoes the prior series but it's an improvement on it. And it resonates on a global basis. It's driving our consumer products business. Our -- in a difficult general environment, our ancillary revenues have grown in the past quarter, and that's really driven by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. And a lot more opportunity there. And I'm really excited about the Paramount film that is -- has just started production, with Michael Bay as the producer. And when that gets released next year, that will be yet another step forward in building that franchise again on a global basis. And it just -- it works on our -- on all of our platforms and it will just add an important new leg on the stool of our consumer products business and reinforce our other properties, by the way.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "And just a follow-up with Tom on the leverage. Your leverage, I think, you said is down to 2.4x. It sounds like, from your commentary in terms of the pickup in distribution fees and accelerating ad sales, that you're going to end up with far more rapid growth in EBITDA in the back half of the fiscal year and into '13 -- and I'm sorry, into '14, and just at what point do you start to get more comfortable to move your leverage target up a little bit? Because it just seems like you're generating a good amount of cash and growth is accelerating and you're ending up kind of deleveraging.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Rich, we continue to kind of target, like, 2 to 2.25 leverage ratio. We'll continue to do that for the foreseeable future. We think the strong cash flow that we generate as a company and the excess free cash flow that we talked about, over $8 billion dollar return in a little over 3 years is pretty impressive. If you go back to when we started this, it's over -- almost 25% to 30% of the market cap at that point in time. So we think that model serves us well and provides us with greater access to capital markets.", "Wade Davis", "Why not stick at that.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just circling back on your comments about the advertising outlook and expecting ad revenue growth to accelerate in the third quarter. I guess, are the drivers behind that really just the very strong improvement you're seeing in ratings? Or are you also seeing some, I guess, pick-up or acceleration in the underlying advertising market? I guess any comments on scatter you could provide would be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We have -- certainly, a driver of the improvement is correlated to improving our ratings, but we are also seeing strong demand. Particularly if you look at our mix, we're seeing a better mix of advertising demand. So we've really made great strides in categories like autos, retail, quick-service restaurants, beverages, computer, hardware and software, but we're seeing strength in important categories to add to our traditional areas of strength that's been there. Then pricing is very strong. We're seeing -- in the last quarter, we had -- upfront-to-upfront pricing was up in the mid-single-digit area. Scatter-over-upfront, on average, for our networks was up about 20%. And if you look at scatter-over-scatter, that was up in the low double digits last quarter. So there's good demand, and we're feeling very good with the combination of our better performance, particularly the Nickelodeon family; and the general environment, which is positive. And that also bodes well for the upfront that we are entering into.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just a follow-up on Nick At Nite where we've seen some improvements there. Is that just from a better lead-in from Nick? Or are you also feeling the programming there is where you want it to be?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "It's both. It's a good lead-in from Nickelodeon delivering a better audience. And we are seeing strength in Friends, for example, which has built up. And we're combining -- from an advertiser perspective, combining strong third-party content with our original content, it just provides an attractive mix for them. So it's a good story, and it's one that we worked hard on over the last several quarters and it's coming to fruition.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.", "Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "This is Eric Katz, on for Marci. I was just wondering if you can comment on the tone or strength of the Nickelodeon upfront that recently took place?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We had wonderful reaction at our presentation. I talked to a lot of advertisers. It was exceptionally well-attended. And they're very pleased with the progress Nickelodeon has made where we've already sold about 1/3 of our upfront inventory. And obviously, it's very early in the upfront season. So Nickelodeon should have a very healthy upfront this year.", "Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And could you also comment on -- it seems like you're investing in originals in networks such as SPIKE now. Which networks other than Nick and MTV do you see the most upside and likely to see the most investment going forward?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we are -- you're right to point out, SPIKE went from having very little in the way of original content. We have -- we went into the reality genre, with some success with shows like Ink Master and Tattoo Nightmares -- by the way, those shows also improved the gender balance on SPIKE. They're very close to even between men and women. And Bar Rescue, a lot of these shows are, again, shows that our advertisers like. And we are going to also go into the scripted business on SPIKE. So that's a network we're going to build. COMEDY CENTRAL continues to do well. We're increasing the number of shows. We debuted another show last night, Inside Amy Schumer, and there'll be more shows to come there. CMT is starting to show signs of improvement, as we have increased our investment in original programming there with Dog and Beth, and other programming. So we think there's a big opportunity in some of those networks, particularly those like some of the ones I just mentioned, TV Land included, which capture more share in demos where we not -- we have not had traditionally a big market share. So this is an incremental opportunity for us and one that we want to invest in. BET is another example of a network where we have increased our investment in original programming, and that's improved the health of that network.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Janedis of UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A little bit more on kids, maybe more broadly. Can you give us an update on the kids market overall? Is this year's upfront healthier? And to what extent can you monetize the ratings in Nick ahead of the new upfront pricing?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, as I said in response to a couple of questions ago, the kids upfront marketplace is shaping up well for us. Our marketers need to be on our Nickelodeon networks. And so they've been working very closely with us, they're rooting for us. And they're very gratified, as I am, by the new programming that's already on air and that's coming. So the -- really important is the holiday season coming up. We're seeing -- apart from the toy category, we're also seeing a lot of new video game launches, both on platform and games themselves, as we get into that holiday season. And we are growing our non-endemic business, such as automotive. Nickelodeon is a part of the house where automotive business has been growing, and other categories. And we're able to capture more adult dollars as marketers are realizing that there are a lot of moms and dads watching our Nickelodeon networks.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Our aim to monetize in the marketplace. While a large percentage of Nickelodeon's inventory is sold in the upfront, much more so than our other networks, because of the liability bank, we had the turnaround in ratings, was able to be monetized by using the liability bank that we had in place. So the upside in ratings does that come back to us through that.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Well, maybe one other quick one. You've talked about owning more of your content at your networks. I assume that means you'll be buying less content in syndication. Has there been any change in pricing for syndicated content?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "So we're certainly being selective. We are -- we continue to buy third-party content. It's really a shift in emphasis. And so in terms of what we're buying, we're seeing some improvement in pricing, but again...", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Pricing and terms.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "What's that?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Pricing and terms, overall terms.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, pricing and, as Tom points out, overall terms are improving. But look, the important trend is shifting dollars from acquired programming to original programming, not taking away all acquired programming -- we do rely on that, including some of the great film libraries out there, like Paramount. Those continue to play well across all networks, which bodes well for Paramount. But original programming just works better for our brands generally.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I was curious a little bit about the equity in JV, which I know in this quarter was relatively small, but it's interesting. I was wondering if you could give us some color on what are the trends at EPIX and in the India JV? And do you know much we should make as kind of the year-over-year improvement there?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, EPIX continues to perform very solidly. Well, I think you can expect EPIX's bottom line to grow over time as existing distribution revenues grow with lot of stability in -- on the programming cost side, generally speaking, with more distribution coming onstream over the years. So EPIX will -- should be a growing story for us and our partners. India continues to be a great building opportunity, long-term opportunity. We think it's a really strong market. We have a strong position. Along with our partner in India, we will continue to invest to launch new channels and to take advantage of the opportunity to build scale as the revenues improve there. So again, in terms of value, India will improve. We are adding to the growing portfolio of national networks within India. We're looking at regional networks to serve different communities within India. And the bottom line over time should increase once we've established our scale position in India.", "Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I could follow up on the premium network market. There has been something of a change there in the environment, with Starz being spun out as a separate company, a lot of discussion now about the possibility for merger and acquisition activity in that area. I was wondering if you could comment kind of generally what you see as the competitive dynamics there and the need or lack thereof of more consolidation.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we certainly don't see any need for consolidation on our part. We created -- we have a service owned directly by -- by 3 studios. And it's a very good, strong partnership. We -- it's a -- EPIX is, of course, associated with our basic cable networks, which give us some ballast and strength in the distribution arena. So yes, we're going to keep growing EPIX, the profitability will increase. And we can do that in the existing competitive environment. So I can't speak for what is going to happen with Starz, but our focus is on organically growing EPIX.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions are ad-related. The first one is just a follow-up on the very first question. As you roll out the apps, how do you view the optimal monetization of the premium video advertising within those apps? Do you think that OCR and a demo-based measurement is the kind of the optimal path to monetization? Or do you think, over time, you'll seek to take more advantage of traditional sort of ad targeting? And how do you see that developing over the next couple of years? The second question is, if you look at MTV ratings kind of \"post the conclusion of season 5 of the Jersey Shore\" comps, on March 15, can you talk about how ratings have behaved at MTV since the middle of March through the end of April versus the rest of the first quarter? And lastly, the sequential acceleration in the current quarter versus the prior one, would we still be seeing that or still have that expectation if it wasn't for the movement of the BET Awards from the end of June versus the beginning of July?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "David, as far as the apps go, which obviously are just being launched, right now, we are using them to provide incremental marketing opportunities to some of our key advertisers, studios notably, like the ability to broaden their marketing offering with us. You mentioned OCR: There are a lot of issues right now with the -- Nielsen's OCR measure that they're testing. Again, there are some sample issues, a lot of things to be worked out there. So right now, we're -- we -- there are other ways to measure that kind of viewership and monetizing that and, over the longer term, targeting, and particularly with our networks, our ability to see where the content is delivered. Our own information is a valuable tool for advertising partners. And we are engaged in a lot of good conversation, particularly with our major advertisers. And that will be a growing trend over time. As far as MTV's ratings, we -- we're again -- as I mentioned in the last earnings call, we have a better balance across the week than we did when we were so reliant on the Jersey Shore ratings. So that's giving us a better lineup for our advertisers. And we've seen good year-over-year stability at MTV's ratings over the last several weeks, and we expect to have a good ratings performance and better balance for -- as we go forward. And then I think your last point was on the acceleration and the BET Awards. There are a number of -- that's -- overall, that's not really the factor. We also had -- at the beginning of the quarter, there was actually unfavorable comparison in terms of the Easter timing. So when you balance all that out, it's -- there's really not much of an impact, and really the acceleration is more a reflection of both ratings performance and market strength and, thirdly, a better mix as it relates to our own networks. I think I covered all your questions, right?", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I think you did.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next questions from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just following on, on digital advertising, I'm wondering if you could comment on trends within your domestic advertising numbers on digital as a percentage of the total? Is it accelerating? And then just to follow up on the last question, which I thought that was a good one, about audience targeting. I mean, Philippe, you talked about your conversations with marketers. Do you think it's likely, and are they starting to embrace audience data in the way that you described? And as the online TV market, I guess, becomes more data driven, as opposed to, as we know historically, it's been reach-driven, it's been content-driven. Do you think that, that audience data, the multivariable data about viewers, is becoming more valuable? Or do you think it's maybe just not as valuable outside of content adjacency? I know you have the data, you see the data, so wondering if -- to what degree you'll be able to use that as a competitive advantage in your conversations with customers?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "The most important aspect is that we -- yes, we've been under-measured. We -- Our audiences are watching our content in different arenas. The existing third-party measurements data is currently not capturing the viewership that's out there. As we go more into a TV Everywhere environment where people will be -- will have the ability to watch our content on their different devices, both inside and outside the home, that will become increasingly important. And I think the marketing community and the content community are working increasingly directly together to figure out how to work to better measure and target the audiences. Remember that our networks are very targeted to begin with. So it's -- they know who they're reaching, but we can start getting into more data, to more granular data to help that. As far as digital advertising, again, it's becoming more and more a part of the multiplatform package. Clearly, video advertising is a stronger category than the industry broadly. And display advertising, which -- where the trend is down overall, and you're seeing that across many of the technology companies, as well as the media companies. So that's definitely a trend.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Well, Anthony, as you know, the digital inventory is very valuable, especially if it's associated with high-value brands and you can never get enough of that. This week the new fronts are going on, and a majority of the new fronts are being conducted with very -- under very different currencies. The currencies that Google uses, the currencies that Facebook uses, the currency that Hulu uses is a very different currency than the rest of the advertising marketplace. And it's a very fast-growing aspect of our business and one we're paying a lot of attention to and hope to participate in with our inventory because we believe we'll have valuable and good quantities of that inventory in the not-too-distant future.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Creutz with Cowen.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "To kind of follow on this theme, as we have sort of this convergence of better ability to deliver content to audiences on multiple devices, better ability to measure the audiences and then better ability to deliver ads that are relevant for advertisers, is there a point where your willingness to sell content to OTT providers where you don't have the ability to advertise gets less so that your reservation weights for your content goes up because you're better and better able to monetize advertising through your on-demand content?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, again, they're not mutually exclusive. Hulu Plus, obviously, does carry advertising. There are different models out there. There are future-emerging distributors that similarly have models that have advertising associated with it, and we're exploring those. We'll have the ability to evaluate the best way for us to maximize our -- both our brand and our economic situation. And as the world evolves, we will evolve our own strategy, as is happening on the distribution side. Today, we find the deals that we have done to be incremental for us. We've been able to monetize previously-not-monetizeable deep library in a way that's incremental net-net. And we will only do business if we think it will short-term and long-term improve our business. So yes, each situation needs to be evaluated on its own.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Tony Wible with Janney.", "Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit about programming cost, both in film and TV. As you see more of these over-the-top players getting into originals and, as you alluded to, moving more towards originals, and a lot of the other traditional TV networks moving to originals, how do you expect that playing out in programming cost inflation longer term?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I actually don't think it's -- creating great content is one of the hardest things to do in the overall marketplace. We have a long history of doing it, and we'll continue to do so. So it's not about the cost, it's about finding the right creative talent, putting it together. And we produce a variety of content on television, some of it low cost, some of it high cost. Scripted is generally more expensive than reality. I talked about some of our content being very efficient and repeatable. So it's getting the right mix to support the brand. On the movie side, the big movies such as Star Trek and World War Z coming out, they obviously have a big budget, as those films tend to have, but very often, they're lower risk than some of the lower budget. I'm not too worried about the performance of our strong franchises. It's just a question of how well they will do. And then you -- again, you balance that with less-expensive releases like Paranormal Activity, which is a very profitable franchise for us. So the way we manage on the film side is to -- we have not been increasing our net spend on the studio side. The studio has been a capital provider to us, and it's more about finding the quality than it is to throw a lot of dollars at it.", "James Bombassei", "Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference.

The results we announced this morning attest to that. And as I will discuss in a moment, the significance of our performance goes beyond financial results. We saw great creative and operational success throughout the quarter and positive signs that our momentum will continue.", "Thanks to our sustained investment in original content, we continued to see sequential ratings improvement at a number of our key networks. Nickelodeon is clearly on the way back, with new live-action and animated hits that fueled robust ratings. We completed our upfront negotiations early and very successfully, achieving significant volume increases in a difficult market. We also struck a distribution deal with Amazon in which we received great value for our content and gained a strong promotional platform for our consumer products. And Paramount Pictures launched 2 commercially successful and critically lauded tentpoles with Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z.", "Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a moment, but let me briefly recap Viacom's financial performance for the quarter. Revenues increased 14% to $3.69 billion and operating income grew 20% to $1.09 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased 24% to $635 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 33% to $1.29.", "We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.275 per share, effective with the dividend paid July 1. We also repurchased $700 million of stock in the quarter, under what was our $10 billion share repurchase program. We are today announcing an increase in the size of our buyback program from $10 billion to $20 billion.", "Given our improving operational and ad sales performance, improving U.S. macroeconomic environment and the attractive interest rate environment, we are comfortable returning to our target leverage ratio prior to the recession. As a result, we are increasing our target ratio to the 2.75 to 3.0 range.", "Viacom's stock is a very good value. Our share buyback remains very accretive. And we will continue to aggressively return capital to our shareholders. Accordingly, given the added balance sheet capacity from our new leverage target, we will augment our current buyback pace with the purchase of an additional $2 billion of our stock over the next several months. The pace of our open-market purchases, which are part of the $20 billion program, will be subject to regulatory limits on trading volume. After December 31, we anticipate that our buybacks will return to a pace comparable to our most recent quarters.", "Moving on to our Media Networks. Revenue in the segment grew 13% to $2.57 billion, thanks to growth in both advertising and affiliate revenues. Domestic advertising revenue increased 6% on the strength of continued ratings improvement among our networks. For the September quarter, we expect to see continued sequential improvement in ad revenue growth.", "For the adult upfront market, we secured mid-single-digit volume growth by moving early while also improving our mix of advertisers. We saw a great outcome on the kids side, too, where we maintained volume and increased our share in a market that was down overall.", "Domestic affiliate revenue grew 28% in the quarter, thanks to the benefit of our digital distribution agreements and rate increases. Core domestic affiliate growth, which excludes digital distribution, increased in the high-single-digit range. We expect total domestic affiliate growth of 10% for the full fiscal year.", "In June, we completed a landmark multiyear agreement with Amazon for distribution of a broad selection of library programming from across our brands. The deal not only reinforces the value of our content, it also validates our view that the digital distribution market remains strong and growing and will enhance the overall economic environment for must-have brands and programs. It is also noteworthy that our programming on Amazon Prime Instant Video will live in a network-branded environment, one that connects audiences with our many consumer products available through the world's leading online retailer.", "We continue to mine digital distribution opportunities abroad as well, where we recently renewed our agreement with Netflix in Latin America. And as part of our broader Amazon agreement, we struck a deal with LoveFilm in the U.K. and Germany.", "Our ratings resurgence is a big part of the story, so let me take a moment to touch on highlights at a few of our networks. At Nickelodeon, our sustained investment in new original content, driven by a reinvigorated programming and development team, led to significant ratings gains. Nickelodeon was up 11% in its core demo for the quarter. Nickelodeon also drove viewing among kids 2 to 5 in the quarter, as the network strategy to move preschool programming from Nick Jr. to Nick in key dayparts continued to pay off.", "Several new Nick shows emerged as hits right out of the gate. The live-action comedy, Sam & Cat, from Nick's marquee hit maker, Dan Schneider, is performing very well in its debut season, as is the animated series Sanjay and Craig, which has the offbeat sensibility of many of the network's most iconic hits. Haunted Hathaways, another live-action series, premiered in the current quarter to more than 3 million viewers. These new hits are significant, not only for their big viewership, but also for their strategic timing. Each will be well established with audiences in advance of the holiday season, Nick's most critical quarter from an ad sale standpoint. We'll have new episodes of these new shows; new series, Rabbids and The Thundermans; and new seasons of Fairly Odd Parents, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Legend of Korra in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, as well as several preschool premieres and holiday specials.", "July marked Nickelodeon's sixth straight month of year-over-year ratings growth. With ratings stable and growing, Nickelodeon is striving to raise the bar. We will continue to fuel the pipeline, investing in promising original content, new producers and new talent to increasingly diversify the programming mix. We are very optimistic that Nickelodeon's upward trajectory will continue.", "We are optimistic that Nick at Nite will continue its recent growth streak as well. In the June quarter, Nick at Nite ratings were up 29% in its core demo. And nearly every show in the Nick at Nite lineup increased ratings over last year. Full House, in particular, has brought the network significant strength in prime that is carrying throughout the schedule.", "MTV saw the successful return of several hits in the third quarter, including Awkward, Catfish and Teen Wolf, which is attracting series-high ratings in its third season. We increased the marketing push behind the new season, responding to ratings trends, which show that highly serialized shows can often capture significant new viewership in season 3.", "MTV continues to build out a balanced schedule of hits in its critical 10 Spot time period. Most recently, we established a strong position on Thursday nights with Ridiculousness, which continues to build viewership and repeat well across dayparts. MTV also expanded the Guy Code franchise in the third quarter with the premiere of Girl Code, another cost-efficient series that strengthens our Tuesday night female programming block and repeats well.", "MTV held its summer pilot screenings at the end of July, featuring a significantly higher volume of potential series, reflecting not only our stepped-up investment in more original content, but also the healthy output of our new development team. MTV is currently reviewing these pilots, and you will start to see some of those series on the network in early 2014.", "CMT delivered a stellar performance in the third quarter. The network increased ratings by 29% in its core 18 to 49 demo, making it 1 of the 5 fastest-growing entertainment networks in cable for the quarter. This success is the culmination of our ongoing efforts to transform CMT's programming. The network completely revamped its development team, creating a tri-coastal group in Nashville, Los Angeles and New York with increased expertise in areas including brand development, field production and talent casting. The new team has doubled CMT's programming output while only incrementally increasing costs, with a focus on bold, highly repeatable shows that harken back to the network's country music core and echo its themes.", "Dog and Beth: On the Hunt is a great example and has emerged in its first season as the network's top series. It's brought a lot of new viewers to CMT, helping lift ratings across the schedule. There's a lot of room to grow at CMT, and we see great things ahead.", "At BET, the first-ever BET Experience in June was a creative and commercial success. The 3-day festival in Los Angeles attracted more than 100,000 visitors and featured many unique sponsorships that connected marketers with the BET audience in new ways. The event gave the BET Awards a big lift, airing the show to 7.8 million viewers, its second-highest viewership total ever. The BET Awards also provided a strong promotional platform for a new season of The Game; and TV movie Being Mary Jane, starring Gabrielle Union, which BET has picked up as an ongoing series. I'm happy to share that we will present the BET Experience again next year.", "Our brands continue to drive the conversation on social platforms. The BET Awards generated nearly 10 million tweets, for example. In June, we entered an ad partnership with Twitter through its Amplify product that will launch during MTV's Video Music Awards, another social powerhouse, and roll out across our brands to further monetize our enormous Twitter footprint.", "We are doing equally well in the branded app space. The Nickelodeon app has reached 3 million installs in less than 6 months, remarkably quick, and is seeing strong user engagement. The app was well received by our marketing partners at the kids upfront. The MTV app has already been downloaded more than 0.5 million times since its launch in mid-June and is attracting significant advertiser interest, not only in MTV's full-length programming but also for its MTV Other content studio, which struck a marketing partnership with Starcom.", "COMEDY CENTRAL and VH1 will launch branded apps by year's end. And COMEDY CENTRAL's newly launched Stand-Up app has drawn significant downloads and user time spent. Speaking of COMEDY CENTRAL, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the network for earning 18 Emmy nominations. It's a new record for comedy, which is always well represented at the Emmys.", "Finally, Viacom International Media Networks continues to be flexible in its market-to-market approach across the world. We are moving to full ownership models for MTV in Brazil, Russia and Italy, acquiring full operational and editorial control of the brand in these key markets. We see solid long-term opportunities for an owned and operated MTV in these markets, bringing them closer into our centralized global structure to ensure that the network is programmed with the best possible mix of international and local content, resulting in the strongest possible representation of the iconic MTV brand.", "Moving on to our Filmed Entertainment segment. Revenues increased 15% to $1.16 billion in the third quarter. Paramount Pictures launched 2 strong tentpoles in Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z, which are on their way to nearly $1 billion combined at the worldwide box office. Operating results in this segment were negatively impacted by the timing of distribution costs associated with World War Z and Star Trek Into Darkness.", "The next quarter will show significant profitability for Paramount, including from these 2 films. They will likely be moderately less than we anticipated, due to the crowded tentpole schedule this summer and the delay of certain film licensing deals into next fiscal year. For 2014 fiscal year, Paramount will bring several hit franchises back to the big screen with Anchorman 2, a new Paranormal Activity, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, and Transformers 4; and launch high-potential new tentpoles with Jack Ryan and Ninja Turtles.", "Next fiscal year, we'll also see several projects enter the pipeline at Paramount Television. Last week, we named Amy Powell as President of the new television studio, adding to her duties as Paramount's head of Digital and its Insurge Pictures unit. And this week, Paramount Animation made news on 2 upcoming projects for 2015: First, the release date for the SpongeBob SquarePants movie has been set for February 13, 2015. And in late May 2015, Paramount will bring another exciting animated feature to theaters with Monster Trucks, which will be directed by Chris Wedge, the Oscar-winning director of Ice Age and Epic.", "In closing, it was a pivotal quarter for Viacom in which our consistent investment in great content ultimately fueled strong top and bottom line growth. In fiscal 2013, we are investing more than ever in new content, more than $3 billion for our networks in total. Our networks are bringing more and more original content to their screens, resulting in ratings momentum and healthy growth in our principal revenue stream. Paramount Pictures presented 2 successful summer tentpoles and looks to fiscal 2014 with a promising slate.", "We remain steadfastly committed to delivering value and are very pleased to be returning even more capital to our shareholders.", "Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.", "Now, let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 13% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues up 15% and international revenues up 4%. Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "Domestic advertising revenues were up 6% in the quarter, and international revenues were down 6%. The decrease in international advertising was largely driven by softness in Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 28% in the quarter, while international revenues were up 16%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits. Growth in international revenues was due to rate and subscriber increases, new channel launches, as well as growth in digital distribution revenue related to the timing of product availability.", "Expenses increased 6% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 5%, distribution and other expenses increased 47% and SG&A expense was up 2%. The increase in distribution and other expenses was largely driven by participation associated with a digital distribution deal. Excluding the impact from the deal, distribution and other expenses were up 5% in the quarter.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 24%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 45%, up approximately 390 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 13%, partially offset by 6% growth in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 15% in the quarter, principally driven to higher theatrical -- principally due to higher theatrical revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Worldwide theatrical revenues increased 64%, primarily due to higher carryover revenues from the March quarter release of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, as well as higher revenues from the current quarter's releases including Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z.", "Worldwide home entertainment revenues declined 10%, reflecting lower revenues from carryover titles. Worldwide ancillary revenues increased 6%, primarily due to the sale to Disney of the distribution rights to the 4 Marvel films that we previously released theatrically.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $17 million in the quarter, as compared to $46 million last year. The decline in operating income principally reflects distribution costs associated with the release of World War Z at the end of the quarter, partially offset by the benefit from the Marvel distribution rights sale.", "Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $11 million in the quarter. The increase relates to higher deferred compensation cost driven by the appreciation in our stock price. Excluding deferred compensation costs, corporate expenses were substantially flat in the quarter.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Wade, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. And I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our September quarter.", "For the quarter, we generated $728 million in operating free cash flow, compared to $197 million of operating free cash flow last year. Page 5 of the web deck provides components of the free cash flow.", "The increase in operating free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes and higher operating income, partially offset by higher working capital utilization. Cash taxes benefited from the retroactive reenactment of provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense. The unfavorable working capital variance in the quarter was principally due to the timing of collections associated with product made available under a digital distribution deal.", "Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.", "As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding and $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the June quarter, as we returned a total of $834 million of capital back to our shareholders between our buyback and dividend programs. Philippe has already addressed our increased buyback authorization and our continued aggressive capital return going forward.", "Now, let's turn to some of the seasonal factors impacting the remainder of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2013, we anticipate domestic affiliate revenue growth of 10%. Accordingly, in the September quarter, affiliate revenue growth will be in the high single digits. For the full year, we continue to expect high-single-digit growth rates for Media Networks programming expense. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.", "Moving on to taxes. Given the strong performance of our films overseas, we now forecast a book tax rate of 34% for 2013. As for cash taxes, due primarily to the retroactive reenactment of provisions related to film and TV product that I mentioned earlier, cash taxes will be significantly lower than book taxes for fiscal 2013. Accordingly, we see strong free cash flow growth for the year.", "In summary, we are encouraged as we continue to make progress in improving our ratings and our ad sales performance. We are investing in original content, with a focus on improving those demos and dayparts that have the greatest impact on ad sales. We are also investing in our organization and our infrastructure in order to engage and monetize our audiences as they increasingly embrace consumption of our content on digital platforms. As we do this, we are gaining additional insight into our viewers, enabling us to provide unique opportunities and additional value for our advertising partners. With the increase in the size of our buyback program and our target leverage ratio, given the low capital intensity of our business and our focus on driving margins and free cash flow, Viacom continues to demonstrate a strong capital allocation discipline and a commitment to driving shareholder value.", "With that, I'll turn it over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Philippe, with the U.S. outlook gaining visibility, can you refresh the outlook for international growth? I think, over the last few years, you've emphasized an international margin opportunity. And there's a wide variety of growth rates among the various media companies in terms of international cable networks. Where should Viacom shake out looking forward? And how do you drive that business?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Doug, the -- our international networks have been hurt this year by the slow environment in Europe. We had negative ad sales growth in the quarter that just ended, although we expect that we'll turn back to positive ad sales growth in this quarter. And as we are launching new networks, which we have been doing, and turning certain networks into wholly-owned networks, we expect the performance to improve as we go forward. In the meantime, we're using this opportunity to expand our footprint and really build value for the future. There's a lot of value there, and we're building very valuable assets, really, across all continents right now.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Do you see a point where...", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And as the foreign markets recover, especially in Southern Europe, I think the group is very well poised to really take advantage of that and put up some very significant growth statistics.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes. And meanwhile, we'll continue to drive affiliate revenue growth in our international footprint.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Do you see a point where international growth is actually accretive to the overall growth rate for the division?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Absolutely.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Absolutely.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then, just a clarification. The July repurchases pace was a little bit slower. And I -- you gave a lot of details around increasing the buyback. But just timing-wise, does that mean that $700 million pace isn't the right number for the September quarter in terms of the -- in other words, we're trying to figure out is it $700 million a quarter, plus $2 billion? Or is it a little less than $700 million this quarter because July was less?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we have a blackout period ahead of the earnings, so that accounts for the what appears to be a slower pace at the beginning of the quarter. But we -- as we discussed the last earnings call, we had budgeted for $700 million of buyback in this quarter. Obviously, today, with the announcement of the augmented buyback program, we will add $2 billion over the next several months to our normal $700 million pace for this quarter and next quarter.", "Operator", "And next we'll go to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You've got some very favorable sort of industry trends in the back half of the calendar year now through December with a pickup in kids-oriented films and then the 2 competing video game console launches. How should that -- I mean, should that impact have an incremental sort of boost to how we should think about advertising revenues for sort of the next sort of 5 months or so?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, certainly, we do have a favorable environment generally and a favorable environment as it relates specifically to Nickelodeon ratings. As you recall, in last year's December quarter, we had -- we were having ratings issue, so we were unable to meet demand in that we didn't have enough inventory to meet the holiday season advertising demand. So as you point out, we have more inventory to sell, as our ratings have improved. And as you correctly pointed out, particularly in the games area, there are a lot of new consoles and big games interesting kids.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then when you're looking at the ratings at MTV, could you give us some color? Is there a more meaningful pickup between the sort of the standard day ratings we typically see and either the C3 or maybe even the C7 kind of data that you may get that would potentially be a benefit if we do see a change now from sort of a C3 to a sort of C7 system down the road?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we certainly get -- I mean, right now, we monetize C3. We certainly see, across many of our networks, a lift when you go to C3. And we've been investing in our programming in our key networks, where there are revenues to be had. So our ratings performance has improved, and MTV included. If you look at the beginning of this fourth quarter, our ratings are up year-on-year across -- pretty much across-the-board, with the exception of Nick Jr., where we strategically moved some programming off, onto Nickelodeon.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Alexia, we've also had good strength, very good growth in ratings in primetime demos across certain key monetizable networks, which really helps us drive advertising sales, as the value of ratings in those times period is critical for us.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Rich Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "I'm wondering -- you made this big change in where you sell your digital rights in the U.S. And I think, Philippe, you took a lot of heat for selling to Netflix originally. There was a lot of skeptics saying that, that's why Nickelodeon ratings were down. And clearly, Nickelodeon's rebounding, regardless of your digital deal. But wondering, as you look at the early data that you're seeing from Amazon, what is the actual utilization of your content look like during the current few months of this contract versus what you were seeing? I mean, Amazon appears to have far fewer streaming users than Netflix. Do you look at that kind of exposure of your content being positive, negative for -- in terms of what happens to your ratings? Just, how do you think about that dynamic? Because you obviously made the choice to sell to Amazon versus Netflix.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, yes, we were in discussions with all players in the digital distribution universe. And we ended up with Amazon in this particular case for the content that we licensed to them because of the great dynamics of the overall deal. And to your specific question, yes, Amazon Prime today has significantly less reach than Netflix. Obviously, our content will help drive their sub numbers up, which is why they were very interested in our content. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we also like the Amazon environment in that our brands are brought out more clearly in the Amazon Prime environment than they are in the Netflix environment. But we continue to do business with Netflix around the world and expect to do so in the future. We said previously that it's hard to measure the impact on ratings, but we did look at a number of our streams, and even if you assume that it was all cannibalistic, it had a -- it would have a very modest impact on ratings. So we never thought that was a major factor. But overall, the -- we're extremely satisfied with the Amazon deal, both for monetary and nonmonetary reasons.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "And you can still sell content to Netflix from Nickelodeon and your other networks. You just have certain exclusivities, but we could still expect a deal from you in the U.S. for some of the Dora content and other Nickelodeon titles?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we have -- we do have some degrees of exclusivity. We have a lot of content available to license to all distributors concerned.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Of course, as you know with your kids, kids are going to consume -- certain kids are going to consume content on tablets. And you have -- if you want your content to have a shot at being consumed, you have to have it on a tablet. So we're aggressively putting our content up on tablets through distribution partnerships and also using now the Nick app, which has been phenomenally successful, because we want kids to be able to consume our content wherever they want to consume it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions on the digital side. The first is, could you break out on the domestic advertising base generally, how much of your advertising revenue comes from the digital side versus the traditional -- what we call the traditional side? And then can you talk about the sequential trends in the growth of those areas? And I guess, lastly, can you talk about, are you doing anything -- or have you been doing anything over the last kind of 6 to 9 months that's been particularly different about how you monetize your digital inventory?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "David, yes, we don't break it out because the way we sell now, we sell multi-platform packages to our major advertisers. So when we have a campaign, that campaign, for many of our advertisers, will live across multiple platforms. And as we roll out, as Tom mentioned, apps across our different brands, that is a part of what we offer. So the distinction that used to be made between digital and so-called traditional revenues is just blurring. The same goes for the creation of content. Those lines are blurring as well organizationally within our company. We have really folded in the organization such that we talk less about the manner of distribution and focus more on how we reach consumers, both from a creative standpoint and from an engagement standpoint. So it all works together. Clearly, in terms of the sequential trend, we have been increasing our resources in presenting content, creating content and providing richer opportunities for our advertising partners to engage consumers.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "David, also, from a trend point of view, display in terms of its importance is going down, and video inventory is going up in value and up in volume. So that plays to our strong suit as we continue to emphasize that across our house.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And I guess, just one quick follow-up. If you think about the measurement, because as Philippe said, you're -- these are really integrated products now, are you selling the digital portion on an OCR basis? Or are these -- are there still sort of different currencies for those impressions? That's my last question.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We're not participating in the OCR system, which we believe has a number of flaws, but what we are able to do, we have first-party data on our digital distribution. So we provide -- we can marry the first-party data that we have with, for example, traditional Nielsen ratings on our television screens. And increasingly, you will see the importance of first-party data growing, and as well as other third-party data sources growing. So the -- that all works to our benefit, because we have a lot of viewing that is not measured by traditional sources.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "David, there is an emergent currency that is growing fast in alternative currency to the industry standard.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "First, one follow-up on your comments around working capital and just to get a sense of, are the digital distribution deals generally featuring payment terms that are somewhat more pushed out than, I guess, your affiliate fees with conventional distributors? Semi-relatedly, have you been seeing any pushback from marketers in terms of their payment terms? Certainly have heard a lot of the noise around that with the global ad agencies. And then I'll just ask my other unrelated question to that. You mentioned the BET event. I was curious, what percentage -- or can you characterize, how much of your ad sales are in any way attached to or bundled with or otherwise assigned to traditional ad sales are paired with nontraditional marketing sales?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "As far as the lag between recognition of revenue from the digital deals and the payment, it's really a function of the fact that accounting...", "Wade Davis", "Syndication accounting takes place.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes. So those, the accounting rules require you to record revenues associated with content when it's available and payment terms are normal. They normalize over the course of the deal, as are traditional deals. So there's no difference from a collection-of-fee standpoint as far as that goes. As far as the payments from advertisers, Wade? [indiscernible] we're doing -- we don't see an issue there from our standpoint, or in terms of collections.", "Wade Davis", "None whatsoever.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "And as far as BET Experience. BET Experience was an unusual and very successful effort on our part to have -- to turn what was the BET Awards into a multi-day experience where we had a number of concerts, stand-up comedy, panels, promotional opportunities for advertisers. So in that particular case that you cited, we had a lot of nontraditional marketing opportunities that were tied to our event. At the same time, the excitement surrounding the whole weekend experience really was a part of driving our ratings. So it just -- it provided a lot of marketing value for our television show, which made it very successful from an advertising sales standpoint.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And Brian, to the extent of the classification of the revenues, the revenues that were advertising revenues or advertisers buying time in, around that event were classified as advertising. And our participation in other revenue streams were classified, for the most part, as ancillary.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I get it. What I was trying to get at, I guess, is it's -- certainly as I look forward a few years, post all the changes with the agencies, it seems that one of the more important things that media owners are doing, I guess, is events like this. So just trying to get a sense of to what degree that offering more, let's use the word native, sort of marketing activities are playing out in your universe?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, in general, integrated marketing is a huge selling point for our company. We have a lot of events. We have a lot of shows that lend themselves to in-show marketing and related marketing on social media and elsewhere. So that's been a part of what we do. And that -- and the importance of that keeps growing.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "A great example of that would be a car company who is at the event with their automobiles. This gives them an ability to have a physical presence tied to an advertising buy around the event. To Philippe's point, this integrated marketing concept is becoming more and more and more important and a major area of emphasis for us and other large media companies.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Not to mention the fact that the marketers, our clients, love to come to these events. They really get to see our brands live with their fans. So it just creates a great sales opportunity as well.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions on the longer-term financial model. I think you guys have said in the past that you expect, over the longer term, high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth in affiliate fees. I'm just wondering if you could affirm that, if you still see that, and do you think next year has a chance of achieving that level of growth, even incorporating the Amazon comp? And then I actually have a couple of quick follow-ups.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Anthony, yes, we continue to see high-single-digit to low-double-digit affiliate revenue growth next year and for the foreseeable future.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And on programming expense growth, I think, Tom, you said in your prepared comments, high-single-digit growth for fiscal '13. With all the content that you're investing in going into next year, how do you think that programming expense growth in '14 will compare to '13? Is it -- is there anything you could tell us directionally on that?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Yes, we'll still be in the mid- to high-single-digit range. We're actually in the midst of budgets right now. We have good visibility on that. So we think that'll be the case.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last one, Philippe, I mean, I feel like with each successive acceleration in the buyback program, we're sort of getting the message, this is a creeping LBO. And I just wonder, do you ever foresee a situation in the future where you took in all the public float and Viacom were not a public company? Wondering what you think about that potential at any time down the line.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, I'm not a long-term prognosticator in that way. I just focus on the here and now. And here and now, we believe our stock is a great value, the dynamics of our business are strong and we have a lot of financial capacity. So we are just focusing on building value and returning capital to our shareholders. So this is an opportune time, particularly given current interest rate conditions, to return even more capital to our shareholders.", "Operator", "Next we'll take a question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.", "Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I have 2. Obviously, the increase in your target leverage ratio and the buyback is clearly a sign of your and the board's confidence in improving trends. So just, what is giving you this confidence now? Is it due to personnel changes? Is there anything else? So that's the first question. And then the second thing is, how should we think about the mix of reality versus scripted programming at MTV? Any color on what the mix is now and how this might look over time?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Marci, yes, we -- our confidence is informed by the fact that, yes, we have added a lot of programming talent in our ranks. And as we look at the lineup today and going forward, we have real programming momentum across, really, all of our networks. That gives us confidence. We've just been through a very successful upfront season, and that gives us, certainly gives us confidence as we look forward into next year. And we see good underlying dynamics. Even though many would like the growth to accelerate in the U.S. economy, we do see good dynamics there. So that gave us confidence in going back to our traditional leverage ratio. As far as MTV goes, we will continue to have a mix of reality and scripted programming. We've had really good success with the scripted programming which we introduced just a few years ago, with shows like Teen Wolf and Awkward. And as you look into next year, you will see additional scripted and reality. And as you know, at MTV, we also have a revamped programming and development team. And from what I've seen so far, there's just a lot of exciting development ahead in both genres.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi Investment Research.", "Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You guys have clearly taken market share in terms of ratings, but if I went back, if -- I don't remember how many quarters ago it was, 6 or something, there were some discussion about sampling anomalies or whatever with Nielsen. And so I guess my question is, as we think about the ratings improvement that you guys are showing, is it really one-dimensional and is it -- it's just better shows taking market share? Or is there another dimension that's helping you as well, with the tailwind maybe coming from sampling changes that occurred at Nielsen?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "We have no visibility on the -- on what Nielsen does, so we -- the only thing we have visibility on is the quality of our programming. We know that we have stepped it up in that area. And we're just at the beginning. We changed our programming team over the course of the last year, 1.5 years. And they have been working assiduously on working with new producers, new creators. And there's just an awful lot in the pipeline. So we tend to -- we try to focus on what we can control and what we have knowledge of. And whatever the measurement system, that will drive our future.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just -- I have a couple of questions going back to sort of figuring out the financial firepower of the balance sheet here. Tom, can you just remind me -- remind us specifically the leverage calculation? Are you talking gross debt? And what are the sort of contingent liabilities that the agencies include that we need to be mindful of as we think about that new leverage level going forward?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Yes, the different rating agencies have different leverage calculations, what they include. We include our commitments that are visible on our -- in our disclosure, in our 10-K and 10-Q. We use gross debt, not net debt. And we feel that's somewhere in between some of the more traditional textbook definitions of leverage and some of the rating agencies'. So each rating agency has a different one, and you will have to go to them. We've been working and chatting with the rating agencies on this construct. And they will be issuing their commentary on it after this call.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then I think, post the $2 billion add-on, you'll be within that 2.7 to 3. So maybe you can just verify that, or if you agree or not. And going forward, beyond that, as you said you'd return to the $700 million a quarter run rate, do you plan to sort of stay within that new range, sort of at fairly strictly? And if so, should we be thinking about using any additional capacity for more buybacks as you grow the business? Or should we also be thinking about leaving some room for things like M&A and stuff?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, Ben, let me take that. The -- our target is the leverage ratio, so that as our -- so we are managing to that leverage ratio, which we will stick with. And as we do that, we continue to invest in our business. We -- our M&A is, continues to be very limited and very targeted, it tends to be small-bore and very additive and still gives us a lot of capacity. We expect, as we said, to continue at a comparable pace as we look forward, but what we will continue to do is to evaluate it each quarter and we -- and then we announce, as we always have, what we intend to do in the following quarter when we have these earnings calls. But our current expectation is continuing at a comparable pace, which is -- which could be at the $700 million range or it could be a different number, it could be more as our business expands, or less. It really depends on what -- it's really matching to our investment-grade leverage ratio.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Ben, it's critical to note that we continue to manage this with a very keen eye on the cash flow-generation capability of Viacom. As we've demonstrated in the past in the last downturn, we dramatically de-levered the company within 12 months by applying -- by tapping into the share buyback program and diverting those resources to de-lever the company. So it's -- we understand very much how we can use the accordion of the free cash flow of the company, which is very strong, to mitigate any financial uncertainty that we see coming down the road.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And maybe just one business question. You've talked over the years about moving away from acquired programming a bit. I think you guys bought Scandal from ABC. And I also know, or I've been reading, that The Simpsons maybe come available for cable syndication. Can you just talk about your appetite for acquired and maybe the rationale behind the Scandal acquisition?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, the Scandal was a very well-constructed deal. We continue -- we will continue to have a mix, particularly depending on the networks, between original programming and acquired programming. In general, across our network portfolio, the mix toward original programming will increase. In the case of Scandal, it was a unique opportunity where we have the prior seasons, which will start to air actually later this month, and building up to the new season on ABC, where we will get the right to show the episodes 8 days after it's aired on the broadcast network. So it works well for them, for their marketing purposes and is just a great acquired programming buy, it really fits into the BET brand. But we'll -- we continue to look at shows that work for our networks that have been created before. But overall, when we look at our entire portfolio, we're gradually increasing the original part of the mix.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "So for Philippe, I was very curious by your comment that the Q4 profit on the film side, much as you're expecting the 2 tentpoles to obviously be major contributors, but you alluded to the crowded tentpole summer, which we've heard more than a few times, so I was wondering how that might -- what's your philosophical thinking on that and how that kind of might affect your future release strategy around the summer? Obviously, last year, you guys were -- had a not-so-wonderful summer, and you've rebounded strongly. So I'm just kind of wondering how you'll kind of position your future films in that context? And I have a follow-up.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we always look at the proper dating of our films and so the dating changes as we see what our competitors do. This summer just had a particularly high volume of tentpole pictures from all the studios combined, and that's not going to recur every year. So that was -- some other studios' films were really shaken up by that, where they didn't succeed. We were fortunate that we had 2 strong tentpoles in Star Trek and World War Z that did really well, one a previous franchise, one a new franchise. So we have -- we hoped to drive the viewing of those 2 tentpoles for a longer period of time, to drive the profitability even higher. And the crowded schedule limited the run of a lot of pictures this summer, ours included.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Okay, that's fair enough. And separately, on the Media Network margins, how should we think about that? Obviously, you had a very major margin expansion in the quarter and I -- granted, some of that is coming from the digital distribution. But you also talked about a $3 billion in content spend, which I'm trying to connect the dots in terms of the potential impart -- impact on margins. And I guess the first thing is, in terms of that $3 billion, how much of that is kind of your kind of run rate or natural spend, as opposed to kind of an evolution of some of the factors you talked about, the blurring of the lines in content investments across your networks? So if you can all kind of put it all together to understand the context of your margins, that would be very helpful.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Tuna, the $3 billion is consistent with the guidance we have given in terms of increasing the rate of change of content spend, so there's nothing new about that number. That's a number that we've had all along and the number that we've been talking about when we tell people we're going to increase in the mid-to-high single digits. So that's what's included there, that has afforded us the opportunity to dramatically expand our original content. That has been very, very successful across all the networks that we're doing it on and gives us the confidence that our ratings will continue to improve and continue to improve in timeframes, so like primetime, when we can sell that at higher revenue levels than previously. So all that is driving what I believe is a great strategy on how we invest in content, invest in programming, to drive the top line growth, which results in better margins.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Does the SVOD market dynamics affect your thinking in that regard, in terms of the investment, in terms of amount and type of programming?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "SVOD is another marketplace, that once again shows up, for the most part, on the affiliate line. And to a great extent, we believe if you make great programming, that great programming translates across all marketplaces.", "Operator", "We'll take that question from Drew Borst with Goldman Sachs.", "Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the potential for consolidation among cable and satellite companies domestically. And I realize you don't want to comment on your specific contracts, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to share some general thoughts about what happens to the affiliate contracts in the event of consolidation among 2 cable or 2 satellite companies. Would the contracts get folded together? Or do the 2 contracts kind of run in parallel until expiration?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, look, as you correctly point out, it's hard to get into specifics. We have to see what the deals are, and every contract is different. So we -- what we focus on is just continuing to create great content, have great brands and provide great value to our viewers and to the distributors. And whatever the size of the distributor, we have -- we always have additional functionality and content to work with them on.", "Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and maybe one quick follow-up, if I might. Again, sorry, back on margins within the Media Networks group. I think, when you back out the digital deal, it looks like you guys are, expanded margins nicely in the quarter year-on-year. And it occurs to me, it sounds like the international margins are probably still a drag. I was wondering if you could confirm that they are kind of holding you guys back a little bit, but as things maybe pick up from a macro standpoint into next year, that, that could be a real source of opportunity?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Clearly, international margins in our Media Networks business are lower than our domestic margins, but they will -- those margins, over time, will continue to grow.", "Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I just meant, Philippe, if they were compressing sort of year-on-year in the international margins because of the top line weakness.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Drew, they are a drag mathematically on the overall margin. And when we get resumption of growth in the international space, they will become accretive to our margin growth.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everybody for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended September 30. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our CFO.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page #2 on the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner M. Redstone", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and welcome to Viacom's fourth quarter conference call. Once again, we have reported outstanding results, with growth across the board in the quarter. Making great content is the heart of our business, and today, we are producing more creative and exciting entertainment than ever before in our history. Our creative leadership team, led by Philippe, is ensuring that our creative success results in solid returns and growing value for our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to my good friend, one of the wisest men I have ever met, Philippe.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you so much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by briefly covering the company's financial performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year, and then Tom and Wade will go into greater detail.", "In the fourth quarter, revenues increased 9% to $3.65 billion, and adjusted operating income rose 16% to set an all-time quarterly record of $1.21 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased 18% to $739 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 28% to $1.55, also an all-time record quarterly result.", "For fiscal 2013, revenues were $13.79 billion, down 1% from the previous year, and adjusted operating income rose 1% to $3.94 billion. Full year adjusted net earnings from continuing operations rose 2% to $2.32 billion, while full year adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 11% to $4.68.", "Our cash flow and balance sheet are strong, and we remain steadfastly committed to our dual objectives, investing in everything we need to grow our content business and returning capital to our shareholders. In fiscal 2013, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. That includes the repurchase of nearly 70 million shares or approximately 14% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year and more than $550 million in dividends paid.", "On our last earnings call, we announced an increase in the size of our share repurchase program from $10 billion to $20 billion. As we noted at the time, we augmented the pace of our buyback with the purchase of an additional $2 billion of our stock completed in the September quarter, which resulted in an aggregate repurchase of $2.7 billion in stock for the quarter. In the current quarter, we plan to return to a normalized buyback pace and purchase $850 million in stock. For the current fiscal year, we plan to purchase at least $3 billion of our stock.", "Our results for the quarter are the capstone to a remarkable fiscal 2013 for Viacom with steady improvement as the year progressed. As always, Viacom's unwavering strategic focus is on content. We invest consistently in bringing more and more original programming to more and more screens to connect with audiences and fuel growth.", "A year ago, we pledged to redouble efforts to return ratings momentum, and we delivered on that promise, particularly at our flagship networks, Nickelodeon and MTV. We invested more than ever in programming to fuel new hits, but we also conducted a thoughtful evaluation and evolution of our development, installing new programming leadership, honing our brand filters, diversifying our producers and creative partners, refining our scheduling and leveraging our audience connections across platforms in innovative ways.", "In the September quarter, ratings were up year-over-year at nearly every network in our portfolio, including Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, SPIKE, CMT and Nick at Nite, among others. We made particular progress in growing range in those demos and dayparts where the opportunity for monetization is the greatest. On a revenue-weighted basis, ratings on our networks were up double digits. SPIKE notched its highest quarterly rating in nearly 3 years. MTV2 had its highest-rated quarter ever as it continues to evolve into much more than a flanker brand for MTV with successful originals including Guy Code and Wild 'N Out.", "Nickelodeon achieved its greatest year-over-year ratings improvement in 16 years. In fact, October marked Nick's ninth straight month of year-over-year ratings growth. Nickelodeon's success is due to its balance of new original hits, including Sam and Cat, The Haunted Hathaways, Sanjay and Craig, Rabbids Invasion and the continued strength of established hits including SpongeBob and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A new Nickelodeon programming team has increased its output while maintaining a solid hit ratio.", "Importantly, while we're seeing great ratings improvement, we've yet to see the full impact of this new generation of hits. As we launch more and more original episodes of these shows, we'll see even greater impact on our ratings across the schedule. And yet, Nickelodeon is keeping its foot on the programming pedal, aggressively green lighting a diverse new slate of series, increasing the volume in its content pipeline and building for the future.", "At MTV, the network made a bold statement on the enduring power and cultural impact of its brand with the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, which attracted 10.1 million viewers and created a Miley Cyrus moment that is still reverberating across the pop culture landscape. MTV continues to build out a balanced schedule of originals including scripted fare like Teen Wolf and Awkward, reality hits including Catfish and Teen Mom and cost-effective utility series such as Ridiculousness and Girl Code that comprise the kind of diverse offerings that the millennial audience demands and advertisers love.", "In fiscal 2014, MTV is ramping up to introduce a new wave of original content developed by its new programming team, including Generation Cryo, House of Food, Virgin Territory, Jerks with Cameras, and new scripted series Faking It and Happyland, and look for a special Miley weekend this quarter.", "In fiscal 2013, across our networks, we executed against strategic priorities with great results, whether it was continuing to implement new brand filters and increase programming investments at CMT and SPIKE to drive ratings growth, reinvesting the BET Awards through the usually successful BET Experience, building a great bench of new young talent at Comedy Central with Amy Schumer, Nick Kroll, Key & Peele and more, or even establishing a strong new format at VH1 in rock biographical films with CrazySexyCool. We deployed our $3 billion investment in content in more new episodes, formats and genres, and the result is portfolio-wide strengths in programming and development that gives us a great foundation as we enter a new fiscal year.", "Of course, we are aggressively monetizing this strength. For the September quarter, we grew domestic advertising by 10%. This is not only attributable to our ratings improvement but also to the efforts of our ad sales organization to build one of the most client-centric, solutions-oriented teams in the business. And networks are leaders not only in creating connected content across screens for audiences but also for advertisers. And we continue to enhance our best-in-class integrated marketing capabilities to meet ever-growing advertiser demand for custom marketing solutions that leverage our creative capabilities. While we are only halfway through this quarter, we currently anticipate mid-single-digit growth in ad sales for the quarter. This will lay the foundation for significant improvement in full year ad sales growth built in our programming rollout across our networks, our upfront calendarization and a steadily improving economy.", "On the distribution side, the highlight of fiscal 2013 was our landmark multiyear agreement with Amazon to stream library content through Prime Instant Video. The agreement demonstrated our ability to collect significant value for our content through a new growing distributor but also to smartly orchestrate our content windowing so that we can do additional deals as new entrants come to market. At the same time, our biggest priority is to work with our cable, satellite and telco distributors as they innovate and bring new products to market.", "Creating hits and driving ratings remains a priority. We continue to build on the current success of our channels, but we're also actively preparing for the future. Our audiences are driving the changes in content consumption that are reshaping the media landscape. We're positioning ourselves to capitalize on these changes across multiple platforms and devices.", "This year, we've successfully launched branded channel apps for Nickelodeon, MTV, and very recently, VH1 and CMT. And we're launching apps for Comedy Central and Logo in the coming months. The Nickelodeon app has attracted more than 5 million installs alone, and each of the apps is garnering significant time spent and commanding premium CPMs. We're also experimenting in how we deliver content on these apps. For example, MTV recently released the complete season of its new series, Wait Till Next Year, on its app in advance of its on-air premiere. Much of the video we're delivering via app is thanks to our TV Everywhere agreements. 10 distributors currently support our authenticated apps and websites, and we expect to reach additional agreements soon.", "Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions in Europe, we made several strategic moves in fiscal 2013 to position ourselves well for the international growth. We aligned our cost structure while launching a number of new channels, including the Paramount Channel in France and Comedy Central Asia, and taking full operational ownership of our MTV channels in Brazil, Russia and Italy. More recently, the 2013 MTV European Music Awards in Amsterdam on Sunday grew ratings in its key demo by over 40%, including big growth in the U.K., Italy and the host country of the Netherlands. The show also rated highly on MTV in the U.S. We will continue to expand our channel presence into 2014. The stabilization we are seeing in the European economy, coupled with our strategic development, should return us to a path for substantial growth in our international results.", "In Filmed Entertainment, Paramount began its fiscal year with a very successful run of our branded film, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, which is well on its way to reaching $100 million in domestic box office. In fiscal 2013, the studio delivered strong performing new installments of its Star Trek, Paranormal Activity and G.I. Joe franchises and launched a new franchise in World War Z. We are very excited about Paramount's 2014 slate. It includes a diverse mix of films that underscores Paramount's commitment to serving all audiences. This includes established tent poles such as the upcoming Anchorman 2 and Transformers 4 next summer, as well as films this award season from Oscar-winning filmmakers including Alexander Payne's Nebraska and Marty Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, and after that, our proprietary franchise films such as Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones and Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Paramount has also established a lean television production organization that, together with its existing digital unit, will intelligently take advantage of growing opportunities for quality original content on a wide range of platforms.", "To close, a great fourth quarter of substantial top and bottom line growth concluded a strong fiscal 2013 for Viacom. A year marked by reinvention and renewed ratings and operating momentum. We also continue to restructure our operations to find operating efficiencies. Savings achieved will fund our investment in people and technologies to drive us to an even brighter future as we control the growth of our overall expenses.", "As we enter a new fiscal year, we will maintain our laser-like focus on investing in content, the lifeblood of our company. We will continue to innovate in developing new content, new marketing initiatives and new ways to reach consumers in more places on more devices. As we transform our company to take advantage of all the new opportunities for our content and our brands, we will steadfastly continue to make good on our pledge to return substantial capital and value to our shareholders.", "Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentations summarizing the results for our September quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.", "At our Media Networks segment, revenue in the quarter were up 7% compared with the prior year with domestic revenues up 8% and international revenues up 2%. Foreign exchange had a 1-percentage-point unfavorable impact on international revenues. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "Domestic advertising revenues were up 10% in the quarter, and international revenues were up 3%. As Philippe mentioned, Europe is starting to show signs of stabilization. In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 6% in the quarter while international revenues were up 4%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under digital distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits. Growth in international revenues was due to rate and subscriber increases.", "Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within expenses, programming expense grew 6% while SG&A expense increased 4%. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 11%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 42%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 7%, partially offset by 5% growth in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were up 11% in the quarter, principally due to higher home entertainment and ancillary revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues increased 31%, primarily due to higher carryover revenues from the June quarter release of World War Z. Home entertainment revenues were up 24%, reflecting the strong mix of titles released in the quarter, including Star Trek Into Darkness, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and World War Z. TV license fees were down 17%, driven by the number and mix of titles available. Ancillary revenues increased 54%, primarily reflecting the Marvel distribution rights sales, as well as growth in the proportion of digital distribution revenues for key entertainment titles released in the quarter.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $291 million in the quarter as compared to $195 million last year. The increase principally reflects the profitability of home entertainment titles, as well as profits from ancillary revenues.", "Now touching on corporate. Expenses increased $32 million in the quarter. The increase relates to higher deferred compensation costs related to the appreciation in our stock price, as well as higher incentive-based compensation cost. For fiscal year 2013, the adjusted effective tax rate was 32.9%, reflecting a 110-basis-point improvement over the prior fiscal year's adjusted rate. The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of international versus domestic income.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Wade, and good morning, everyone. Let me talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our 2014 fiscal year.", "For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.1 billion in operating free cash flow and exceeded $3 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The increase in operating free cash flow for the quarter was principally due to lower cash taxes and higher operating income. Cash taxes benefited from provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expenses, as well as from the timing of cash tax payments.", "Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. On our last call, we indicated that we were comfortable returning to our target leverage ratio to the pre-recession range of 2.75 to 3.0x. Accordingly, during the September quarter, we issued a total of $3 billion in senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year maturities. We were able to issue the new debt at a rate commensurate with our overall cost of debt while at the same time extending our weighted average maturity.", "In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.", "As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, some of which will be deployed towards our buyback program. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8x. At September 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "Our return of capital to shareholders continued in the September quarter. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $2.8 billion of capital back to our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock in the December quarter. Our capital return has been consistent. If you look back 3 years to when we started our current share repurchase program, our stock was trading at approximately $36. Since then, between buybacks and dividends, we have returned a total of $12 billion to our shareholders or approximately $20 for each share outstanding at the start of the current program.", "If you go back to 2006, when the 2 companies split, we have bought back an aggregate of 336 million shares in the open market at an average share price of $47. At the end of September, we had 449 million shares outstanding. At our current buyback rate, we will purchase more than 10 million shares in the December quarter based on our current stock price. If you exclude the shares owned by National Amusements, we will have less than 400 million shares outstanding at the end of December.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting our 2014 fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continue to see growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to some digital agreements which are tied to product availability.", "For the full year, we expect the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense to be in the high single digits. In terms of programming expense -- in terms of nonprogramming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.", "For 2014, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 34.5%. We will refinance as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic versus international profitability mix.", "Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, we are currently in production in partnership with Warner Bros. on Interstellar, which is directed by Chris Nolan. Paramount has a number of animation projects in the pipeline with SpongeBob and Monster Trucks scheduled as the first films to be released under their animation label. And we are in development on a number of sequels including Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe, as well as World War Z.", "In summary, 2013 marked a year of accomplishments on several fronts. As we reinvigorated a number of our programming and development teams and increased our investment in original programming, we saw a turnaround in ratings at many of our networks. Our ad sales performance rebounded, and we achieved double-digit growth in our domestic affiliate revenue for the seventh year in a row. We leveraged this improved operational performance to return a record amount of capital to our shareholders.", "As we look forward, our focus continues to be on creating content and experiences that engage our audiences on every screen. We are investing in our organization and our infrastructure in order to monetize our audiences as they embrace new platforms and new technologies. These investments are enabling us to create unique opportunities and additional value for our advertising and distribution partners.", "With that, I will turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I just have quick one for Tom and one for Philippe. Tom, just going back to what you said on affiliates for your guidance, what are you assuming for SVOD in this fiscal year? So you expect it to grow, stay the same or come on down?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I'll take that question, Michael. The way we -- we don't break it out in a way we discuss our affiliate revenues. We have -- in order to get to our high single digit, low double digit, we have a lot of business in the house. So we have run rate of existing deals, both traditional -- so-called traditional and SVOD and other. And we obviously have renewals along the way. We make certain reasonable assumptions and new business that we are in discussions on. So we're very comfortable with the continuation of our high single-digit, low double-digit growth rate this year and actually in the years to come.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. And then I will go to you, Philippe, on international. This quarter was pretty good for international advertising growth. You talked about Europe improving. Was that one of the factors -- how important was Europe in driving this quarter's improvement and sustainability? We've heard a lot about easy Olympic [ph] compares on the continent. So when you look at the year ahead and kind of the trends you've seen in this current quarter, sustainability of advertising growth internationally, how do you feel about that?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I feel that with the stabilization of the European economy and particularly in Continental Europe, the U.K. has actually held up reasonably well for us. We're seeing improvement. So we expect to see high single-digit growth in this quarter and international ad sales, and we expect to have a solid year for the full year and especially as a result of our continuing to expand our footprint in different parts of the world. So that will drive our growth not just this year but in the years to come.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I was wondering if you could talk through the role of digital advertising in the current quarter and just how traction is on apps, to what degree you see incremental revenues from that. Maybe relatedly, I'd love to hear your current thoughts on the state of measurement given the recent Nielsen and Google deal on OCR. And what do you think that advertisers are willing to accept in terms of the data you can provide in terms of first-party metrics?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Let me take the question, and Tom can add to it as he wishes. We are -- as we launch apps, obviously, they serve 2 purposes. One, we are creating a lot of new content for the apps and as well as putting on some of our existing content. And we have the ability to sell advertising directly on that. So as we roll them out, as they expand, as usage increases, that will drive new ad sales. The second purpose of these apps is to support our business with all of our affiliates. And we are looking forward to more widespread rolling out of so-called TV Everywhere capability such that we will have more reach to our consumers. We'll be able to have linear viewing. We'll be able to secure better ratings. We'll be able to secure more engagements because of all the other functionalities that we'll have on the apps. We also look forward to our distributors inserting capabilities like digital ad insertion and the like. So there's a lot of opportunity ahead. On the measurement front, which will also drive the penetration of TV Everywhere capability, we are encouraged by a lot of the initiatives that are on place. And as we go forward and as we roll out this app capability, we will have the opportunity to combine sample type ratings with first-party data that we already utilize on our dot-coms, on our apps and mobile application as we go forward.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Yes. Brian, there's a great deal of demand for digital video inventory that's based upon or delivered within professional -- professionally produced content, and we are enjoying the benefit of that demand as we continue to fill that pipeline with our great content. Also, as Philippe said, I think measurement is just beginning in terms of its evolutionary process. And as you get measurement down, you will evolve currencies behind that, and I'd say we're in the first or second inning of a 9-inning game on that.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Do you see that many advertisers are right now buying integrated packages right now? Or to what degree -- how common is that at this point in time? Or is it really standalone?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "The point that we see is that most of all -- almost all of our advertising is an integrated package because we have great demand from our largest advertisers to buy across the ecosystem.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Two questions. I guess we'll jump balls. First, can you talk about the puts and takes driving December quarter domestic ad growth?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we have -- for this quarter, we have new programming rolling out as the quarter progresses, a lot of new series that are premiering, great lineup for Nickelodeon. It\u2019s going to have a huge Thanksgiving weekend with a lot of original premieres and movies. We see good volume in the scatter market to build on a good foundation that we obtained in the upfront market. By the way, as the year progresses, the calendarization of the upfront gets better for us. So we see optimism ahead for the year as we go on, and a lot of our new programming on some of our other networks such as MTV and BET and others are really kicking in as the year progresses. So we expect this quarter to be solid and the year to be solid.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Does that mean that there's a potential that advertising accelerates during the year?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "There's that potential.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then the second question is the 4Q '13 pulse noted domestic subscriber levels for your channels, including your mature channels, improved over the last year. So by our math, pay-TV video subs in the U.S. is essentially flat year-over-year. So first, did your internal results match what you're seeing from the Nielsen data reported in the 4Q '13 pulse? And is the high single-digit to low double-digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth guidance reliant on subscriber growth at all?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, obviously some variability depending on subscriber growth. That's how we always state our range to be in the high single digit to low double digit. The number of subscribers is holding up reasonably well. We have some lag in our data based on the way we get paid. But it's holding up reasonably well. The mix of distributors is -- improves as our market share shifts, from our point of view, both in terms of the distribution scope of our networks with some of the distributors that are gaining market share, as well as terms. So yes, within that range, obviously, one of the components of improvement would be some growth in subscribers, but we're not dependent on that.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to probe a little bit more on the ad growth. You spoke to mid-single digits that you're seeing here in the December quarter from the 10% that you just put up. I was wondering if you can be more granular on why you see a slower trend in the December quarter than the quarter we just passed. Does it have something to do with the Olympics comps or something to do with categories? I mean, I think kid's movies were good in the September quarter, maybe not as good in the December quarter, so more color there will be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we -- yes, we think mid-single-digit range is good for this quarter. The last quarter really came on strong as the quarter ended. It's a combination of our having really strong ratings across the board and a few categories such as retail pulled up at the -- pulled into the September months, some of the advertising that they originally scheduled for the beginning of the fourth quarter. So retail would probably be a category I would highlight as want to get ahead of the game in their advertising spend. So overall, we see a healthy marketplace, and we're very optimistic. Obviously, we are counting on the economy, the general economy, to continue its recovery. If the recovery accelerates, that will also be good.", "Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And you had very good ratings performance in the quarter. As part of your -- what you're seeing here, just an assumption maybe that these ratings performance doesn't necessarily continue or was there really anything that applies to that in the outlook?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, we feel good about how our ratings will be over the year, particularly on a revenue-weighted basis, as we indicated in our remarks. We're very focused on where the revenues are across our networks, and we have, with the higher volume of programming that we're producing, more flexibility on how we schedule our programming. So we have enough in the pipeline that we can move things around and yes, really look for the opportunities where the monetization is best.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just staying on the strong growth that you saw in the September quarter, were there -- was it really driven by any, I guess, one network? Did one network start to stand out as sort of a bigger driver of that growth? And then second question is sort of the improvement at Nick at Nite, did that sort of broaden your advertiser base a bit? I mean, with the demographics being a bit older, are you finding yourself pulling in maybe some advertisers more traditional for broadcast?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Really, the strength in the quarter was pretty much across the board in our networks. And obviously, when you compare the fact that Nickelodeon, all the Nickelodeon dial, Nick and Nick at Nite as you point out, the improved ratings clearly helped. But across the board, we had strength. And yes, Nick at Nite, along with TV Land and CMT, give us the -- and other dayparts in other networks give us the opportunity to capture some of the older demos to build on our strength in the younger demos. And we can pick up some off-broadcast ad dollars through that. So as our ratings grow or continue strong in those demos, it gives us the opportunity to gain market share there.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "My question is about Paramount. If we look at the full year results and compare it to the last few years, we do see that this year was below what we came to believe is the run rate profitability there. So I was wondering if you could talk about what made this fiscal year '13 different in the film studio and what kind of results should we be expecting going forward.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Vasily, first, we're pleased with Paramount's performance during the year. And this was an unusually crowded tent pole summer where all the studios released a lot of tent poles. And so it's very competitive. And given that, our tent poles, Star Trek and World War Z, did quite well. And I think Paramount was probably unique in not having a tent pole that failed during the summer. So it was a very competitive year, particularly in the summer. In terms of availabilities, yes, we had lower television licensing revenues than we experienced in prior years, and some of that has to do with what our own availabilities are. Some of it has to do, again, with some softness in certain markets, particularly in Continental Europe. And we hope to see improvement in that area in this year. As I indicated in my remarks, we also have a particularly strong lineup this year, as cited in our releases. So we feel we're going to have a solid year at Paramount.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And Vasily, as you know, Paramount has done a great job around the world in terms of JVs on its distribution infrastructure and to further really enhance the core structure of the Paramount group to be able to continue to grow profitability in the future.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant of ISI Group.", "Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "You guys talked about controlling costs apart from your programming costs increasing in the high single digit, can you sort of talk about some of the things that you've been doing to sort of reduce cost across both the film and the network side, automating the advertising process and showing distribution internationally? Where are we on that process? How much is left to be done there? And second, just quickly on cash in hand, given you're returning a lot of capital, what's the optimal amount of cash you should have on your balance sheet?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I'll take the first question and leave it to Tom and Wade on the second one. Yes, we continue, throughout our organization, to look for opportunities to operate our company better. And operating it better involves both saving money by putting in software systems and other systems that make us more efficient, looking for opportunities to work with other partners. For example, we have, just very recently, in the Netherlands, entered into an ad sales joint venture with both Discovery and FOX, which will enhance the ad sales organization there both from a revenue side and a cost effectiveness side. So we always look for operational capabilities throughout the organization. In film, Tom touched on the distribution opportunity around the world. And we, together with other studios, look for more opportunities in more countries to do that as the overall output of these studios has diminished over the year, so it makes a lot of sense to combine infrastructure. And the other part of that, in operating the company better, is as we are doing that, we continue to invest in what we need to grow our business so that we can launch more apps, so that we can take advantage of the strong emerging opportunities in mobile video, and so we can take advantage of international development opportunities, taking control of Brazil and Italy and Russia and really expanding our footprint and our scale in those countries. So yes, that's a dynamic process, and we are -- we never stop on that. So we accomplished a lot, and we continue to look for opportunities. On the cash on hand?", "Wade Davis", "Yes. Cash on hand, Vijay, is in the area of $750 million to $1 billion would be sort of what I would call our optimal or average that we'll have at the end of any given quarter. That will vary, though, as of the end of this quarter with the borrowings that we've done and our net investment. Also, I mean, just to supplement what Philippe said, if you look at our capital expenditures, which is very modest and the majority of our capital expenditure goes into investing in information technologies that really are, on a global basis, driving down the cost of doing business at the company in terms of operating in business hubs on a global basis that support our diverse operations around the world that used to be supported by our operational facility that were diverse and dispersed in different markets. That is driving a lot of efficiencies and allows us, as Philippe said, as we expand into new markets, allows us to enter those markets with little incremental cost. So we think those investments have turned out extraordinary well, and the teams that have put those in place over the last several years have done a great job. And I think in terms of your runway to the future, I think there's significant additional opportunities both as we expand and continue to put more operations through those regional operational centers.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Janedis of UBS.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Philippe, you talked about some of the new programming. Are your original hours increasing this year across the platform? And as you move to more originals versus licensed, how has cost per hour changed?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, yes, so the answer is we are increasing the number of original hours across the board. That's how we're applying incremental spending. We still are acquiring third-party programming, particularly for networks like TV Land and Nick at Nite. But original programming gives us the ability to build our brands better. It gives us programming that we can exploit through different platforms and new distributors. So it creates a lot of value for us. We look at a mix of original programming. So we have some low-cost, efficient programming that repeats really well. For example, Ridiculousness on MTV. We have -- we launched a new format on Comedy Central, @midnight, which has performed very well so far. And then we'll have, obviously, more expensive scripted series. So if you look at it on a blended basis and impact, we see that it is improving our overall results and we continue to look to drive our margins as we continue to invest in programming. And of course, original programming, the more original programming we have, the more distribution and ancillary revenues we have the opportunity to generate.", "John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe somewhat related to that, as you know, there's been some concern in having some Nick programming available online is creating some ratings issues. You referenced the growth there. Are you at a point now where it's pretty clear that any shift in viewing is minimal? And are there any metrics you can share on that?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, in terms of the Nickelodeon programming, as you know, during the course of the summer, we shifted the Nickelodeon programming from Netflix to Amazon Prime. The impact was minimal when it was on Netflix. Given the narrower reach of Amazon Prime, while it's a very successful driver for Amazon Prime and it's a great partnership, there is significantly lower distribution than Netflix had. And for Nickelodeon content on Amazon Prime, it works really well for us because it's a great branded environment. We believe that we get discovery of our programming by new kids. And it helps consumer product sales on Amazon. So we manage that distribution to make sure we maximize our overall revenue and margin.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Alan Gould of Evercore.", "Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I've got a couple of questions. First, can you tell us what percent of your subs come up with new affiliate deals this year? And secondly, I believe we're coming up to the Hard Eight or the Hard Ten [ph], the big Nickelodeon selling season. I mean you probably have a pretty good idea of that. How is the kids advertising versus your overall advertising?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Look, the way I would characterize our affiliate deals, the way we have our renewals lined up now, in any given year, we have under 20% of our revenues up for renewal. That's just the way we have staggered our deals over the last several years. And you can understand that we don't want to get more precise than that. And the overall ad market is shaping up well for us. Nickelodeon has great vitality. The programming is working. Our advertisers are really pleased with what Nickelodeon has done. And Nickelodeon will grab the overwhelming majority of the advertising money available in the Hard Eight and otherwise.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I wonder if you could just review where you're progress has been on your international margins and how you see that developing in 2014?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Doug, 2013 was really a year which was difficult for us in Continental Europe. And we used that time to extend our footprint, as I mentioned before. And with the stabilization in Europe, we look to go back to growing our margins. Our objective is to get to the 20%-plus margins over time. We had hoped to get there by now, but with that setback it'll be a little delayed, but we will get there.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.", "Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "My question was mostly about international profitability as well, so I'll just ask maybe for a little bit more color by country, any ones that are maybe a little better than expected, a little worse and that we could maybe see pickup from?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Again, U.K. has been a pretty solid market. We see great opportunities in Latin America, particularly now that we were able recently to take control of MTV in Brazil. And with that, we are already getting good distribution. We have more opportunities to expand with other networks. We are expanding the Paramount Channel across new territories. We recently launched it in France. France is doing better. Southern Europe, we see stabilization in Spain and Italy, again, with our taking control of the network. We see opportunity there. Russia, again, we were able to launch MTV. We have Nickelodeon distribution. So we see good growth ahead in the years to come. And the India joint venture that we're in continues to get stronger. We will add scale in India with our joint venture partners, and that continues to be a growing media market. And we are already creating significant value for Viacom today in India and will in the future. So really, I go across the world and I see a lot of opportunity over many years to grow our business, and we are committed to making our international networks business a very significant part of Viacom.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question today from James Dix of Wedbush Securities.", "James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 questions for you. First, any color you could give on the pricing you're seeing in your online video offerings. Or is it a little hard to tell because of your integrated packages? Any color you can give as to what growth you're getting from volume increases in online as distinct from other sources. And then secondly, just curious as to where you stand in terms of leveraging the data and analysis that you can get on your younger and more digitally savvy audiences in terms of programming development and marketing strategies. It seems to me that's a lot of opportunity for you over time to maybe improve your hit rate or lower your variability. But curious as to anything you're doing there that we should know about.", "Wade Davis", "Yes. James, the pricing in online, especially, as I mentioned before, in the digital video world, is at a premium to what we get in the linear world. It's a significant premium. And it's highly desired, especially when wrapped around the kind of content that we have. As far as data goes, data has become an increasingly important element in our toolset that we use, both in-house to identify targets and develop product, address our audiences. We have almost 140 million people in our database, IP addresses in our database, and we learn more and more about their preferences for shows and the kind of shows that they want to see on our air. And that has become an invaluable tool for us as we build out both the service functionalities we provide our advertisers and also the kind of content that we develop in-house for all of the core audiences that we serve. So that's really an exciting new area for us and many of the other media companies out there, and I think it's going to be a big change maker in the future that will drive both incremental opportunities on the cost side and also drive, I think, revenue opportunities for us to better serve our core constituencies.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "And James, to your point about programming development, we already see, for example, where we have -- apps are widely distributed like the Nick app where we have a number of short-form features on there. We obviously get to see what kids are picking, what they're interested in, really getting us to think about what kind of programming they might be interested in seeing. And it's a good way to experiment with fairly broad reach on what we're doing. And the same goes with some of the other creative initiatives that we have in our music networks where we're also trying inexpensive short-form content, some of which we will see develop into long-form programming on our television networks.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us in our earnings call.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's presentation.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our December quarter.

Dauman", "Thank you so much, Sumner. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the first quarter of our 2014 fiscal year.", "Viacom turned in a solid performance in the December quarter. We delivered strong double-digit growth in both our quarterly earnings and operating income. Our Media Networks achieved strong top and bottom line growth, thanks in part to continued ratings strength at many of our networks. Among them Nickelodeon, which regained its long-held perch as a top cable network among kids, 2 to 11. It was a great start to what we expect to be a strong fiscal year in which we will continue to invest consistently in original content and connect with our audiences in a growing number of ways across platforms and geographies.", "Let's take a quick look at Viacom's financial performance for the quarter. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a few moments. Revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, a decline of 4%, reflecting increased Media Networks revenues, which were more than offset by declines in Filmed Entertainment due to the number and timing of releases in the quarter. Operating income increased to $960 million, up 20%, thanks to improved performance across the company. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 19% to $547 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 32% to $1.20.", "Viacom's balance sheet remains strong and the company remains steadfast in its commitment to returning significant value to our shareholders while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. We delivered about $1.1 billion in capital directly to shareholders in the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This includes $850 million in share repurchases under our ongoing stock repurchase program. We expect to repurchase another $850 million in stock in the current quarter, and have increased our expectations for the full fiscal year to at least $3.25 billion.", "As I mentioned, our Media Networks delivered strong growth in the quarter, and ratings strength at a number of our key networks fuel that momentum. Nickelodeon reclaimed the top spot among kids' networks for the 2 to 11 audience in the December quarter, thanks to its continued content surge of new original programming across formats and dayparts. Its preschool block was a major highlight with new series \"PAW Patrol\" performing particularly well. Animation generally performed very well, with SpongeBob SquarePants, Sanjay & Craig and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pulling in big audiences. The Ninja Turtles' consumer products line continues to perform very well and is growing fast, ending 2013 as the #1 boys action property in the U.S. toy industry according to NPD.", "Through this month, Nickelodeon achieved 12 consecutive months of year-over-year ratings growth. In the current quarter, a special episode of mix live action hits Sam & Cat drew 4.8 million total viewers and was the network's highest rated telecast with kids 6 to 11 since 2012. Episodes of new series, Haunted Hathaways and The Thundermans, also hit new highs. Next month, the network will continue to expand its programming lineup, with the launch of Wallykazam!, a new preschool series focused on children's literacy and Breadwinners, a new series from 2 young animators new to Nick, one of whom is discovered through its Animated Shorts Program. Nickelodeon will bring the quarter to a close with a 2014 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, which will be hosted by the star of Transformers: Age of Extinction, Mark Wahlberg. In short, Nickelodeon is on a roll.", "Speaking of being on a roll, COMEDY CENTRAL had a great December quarter, its highest-rated quarter in nearly 6 years among men 18-34 in primetime, thanks to the strength of returning hits, Tosh.0, Key & Peele and South Park. Add to that the continued success of @midnight, the first successful entry into the competitive late-night field in recent history. It's a hit with audiences but also with advertisers who now have additional marketing opportunities in the network's highly coveted late-night block, which, with The Daily Show and Colbert, both the top 3 shows in all of late-night among young men.", "In the current quarter, COMEDY CENTRAL returning hits Workaholics and Kroll Show to air along with the debut series Broad City for executive producer Amy Poehler. Poehler recently noted that the network is at a core major point, where it's representing really vital up-and-coming talents. Those talents are fueling a greater offering of top-notch original programming than at any other time in COMEDY CENTRAL's history. SPIKE, VH1 and CMT all delivered strong double-digit year-over-year ratings growth in the December quarter, reflecting our significantly increased investment in originals for all 3 networks. SPIKE, in particular, turning its best December quarter ratings performance since 2010 and its second quarter in a row of double-digit ratings growth. The network continues to successfully broaden its audience, achieving a more desirable gender balance and median age for advertisers. BET also had a great quarter and successfully premiered new series, Being Mary Jane, starring Gabrielle Union this month.", "In the current quarter, MTV is returning many hits to air behind an aggressive, targeted marketing campaign. Already, we are seeing results. Teen Wolf, debut its new season this month to a record 2.4 million viewers. Teen Mom 2 also returned last week with 3.2 million viewers, rankings as MTV's highest-rated series premiere in more than a year. It also looked at the premiere of MTV's new dating show, \"Are You The One\", the network's best new franchise launch since Buckwild. Ratings for the revamped Real World continue to grow every week. And MTV is seeing significant strength in its new Thursday night male-focused block, which includes Ridiculousness, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory and the all-new Jerks With Cameras.", "Our Media Networks segment grew domestic advertising by 3% in the December quarter, a result that was tempered somewhat by ratings at MTV in a softer marketplace in the month of November. In the current quarter, while it is still early, we expect to see sequential improvement in our domestic ad sales growth despite the headwind of the shift of Easter to the June quarter this year. We're also encouraged by the improvement in the international ad market, highlighted by growth in certain European territories, which resulted in double-digit growth in international ad sales in the quarter. Additionally, we recently unveiled our reinvented integrated marketing and branded content team, Viacom Velocity, to serve our marketing partners with even greater creative collaboration. This is an area where we've considerably increased our resources over the past several years and the marketplace is taking notice. A recent survey of marketing executives ranked Viacom Media Networks Music and Entertainment the #1 and #2 integrated marketing units in our industry.", "On the distribution side, domestic affiliate revenues increased by 10% in the quarter. We continue to expect high-single to low-double digit growth in our affiliate fees for the full year. The highlight of the December quarter was our successful completion of our renewal negotiations with Time Warner Cable, which resulted in one of our most comprehensive multiplatform agreements to date. The deal covers not only our Linear television networks but also streaming channels on the mighty WCTV app, streaming video via our TV Everywhere websites or apps for MTV, Nickelodeon, SPIKE, COMEDY CENTRAL, VH1 and CMT, dynamic ad insertion and more. Very importantly, it also includes distribution of EPIX, beginning in May, marking a major step in the growth and profitability of the premium multiplatform network.", "Initiating and supporting product innovation continues to be a key component of our value proposition for cable, satellite and telco distributors. We continue to expand our lineup of TV Everywhere apps with a Nickelodeon and MTV apps rolling out on Android and apps from COMEDY CENTRAL, Nick Jr. and Logo due this year. And in the next few months, we're partnering with Verizon FiOS to bring a new one of its kind linear service to U.S. consumers, My Nick Jr. Results initially by Nickelodeon Friends, My Nick Jr. is a standalone linear channel that gives parents and their young kids unprecedented personalization functionality. Parents can customize the programming lineup based on certain educational themes, math or science, for example. Kids can also indicate whether they like or dislike a show to influence their program offering. It's a truly innovative new service and we hope to roll out with additional distributors, both domestic and international, in the future.", "Internationally, we're seeing improving conditions in the European economy, as I mentioned earlier, which is lifting the ad market. We continue to increase our content investment abroad to capture the opportunities we see at hand. This includes our recent moves to take operational ownership of MTV Italy and to launch wholly-owned MTV channels in Russia and Brazil. We're already seeing the benefit of these moves, as well as our launch of the Paramount Channel in France and I am pleased to announce today that the Paramount Channel will launch in Russia and Hungary by the end of the current quarter.", "Moving on to our Filmed Entertainment segment, Paramount Pictures launched a number of successful releases in the December quarter including Anchorman 2, Wolf of Wall Street and yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Oscar-nominated Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa. In fact, the studio garnered 13 Oscar nominations in total, not only for Bad Grandpa, but also for Wolf of Wall Street and Nebraska, both of which, we are proud to say, earned nods in the Best Picture, Best Actor and Directing categories.", "Looking ahead into 2014, we have Darren Aronofsky's Noah, starring Russell Crowe, debuting in March. We also have strong tentpoles lined up for the summer season including Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as Hercules, starring Dwayne Johnson.", "Also, expect to see more announcements in the months to come from Paramount's new television production units. For starters, the TV studio has just completed a multiproject deal with director and screenwriter Craig Brewer of Hustle & Flow and Footloose. This deal includes humming 2 dramatic pilots for the studio.", "To close, the December quarter marked a very solid start to the 2014 fiscal year for Viacom. As we move ahead, we will maintain our strategic focus on content, investing in the programming and films that drive the new entertainment ecosystem. We will leverage that content to connect marketing partners with our audiences, who remain among the most eager consumers of media and the earliest adopters of new technologies and features. We will continue to fuel the platforms of existing and emerging distributors alike on a worldwide basis. And we will continue to drive results and return substantial capital and value to our shareholders.", "Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade C. Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our December quarter are available on our website. Now let's take a look at our segment results.", "At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 6% compared with the prior year, with domestic revenues up 5% and international revenues up 10%. The increase in revenues in the quarter was principally driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues. Page 10 of our web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "Domestic advertising revenues were up 3% in the quarter and international advertising revenues were up 16%. The growth in the international advertising reflects an improving marketplace in Europe, as well as the impact of new channels. In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 10% in the quarter while international revenues were up 8%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high single digits in the quarter. Growth in the international revenues was due to rate and subscriber increases, as well as new channel launches.", "Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 2% while distribution and other costs increased 19%, principally due to new channels in the international markets.", "SG&A expenses increased 5%, reflecting higher compensation as well as the impact of new channels in the international markets.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 8% and the adjusted operating income margin was 44%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 6%, partially offset by 5% growth in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 30% in the quarter, principally due to declines in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues decreased 52%, principally reflecting fewer releases in the quarter, as well as lower carryover revenues. We released 5 titles this year compared to 8 titles in the prior December quarter. Home entertainment revenues declined 37%, driven primarily by the absence of the current quarter release. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $74 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $139 million last year. The improvement principally reflects lower print and advertising costs related to the number and mix of theatrical titles released in the quarter.", "Now moving below the line, the increase in the interest expense reflects the full quarter impact of the $3 billion of fixed rate that we issued back in August. In terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.5%, reflecting a 100 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of international income.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow, our debt profile and the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors impacting our 2014 fiscal year.", "For the quarter, we generated $278 million in free cash flow compared to $548 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization and cash taxes, partially offset by higher operating income. Working capital was impacted by production spending for our upcoming tentpole releases, including Transformers 4, Interstellar, and SpongeBob.", "Now turning to our debt. For the most part, it is fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we have incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 20 to 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings outstanding at quarter end.", "As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $11.9 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.73x. At December 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn. Our return of capital to shareholders continued in the December quarter. Between our buyback and dividend programs, we returned a total of approximately $1.1 billion of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 440 million shares outstanding.", "Looking ahead, we are on pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock in the March quarter, which means that for the first 6 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $2 billion to shareholders.", "Now let's turn to some other factors impacting the remainder of our fiscal year. In terms of affiliate revenue, we continue to see annual growth in the high-single digit to low-double digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid-to high-single digits. In terms of nonprogramming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.", "At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about the upcoming summer tentpole releases, including Transformers: Age of Extinction and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We expect profits at the studio to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year. Looking ahead at the studio's production and development pipeline, we've recently wrapped production on Interstellar, which is directed by Chris Nolan and stars Matthew McConaughey. We are also currently in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises including Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe and World War Z. In terms of our animation label, Paramount has a number of products -- projects in the pipeline with SpongeBob and Monster Trucks, scheduled for release in 2015.", "For 2014, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 33.5%, reflecting the mix of international profits. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the profitability mix.", "Wrapping up, we delivered strong bottom line results and we saw a positive developments on several fronts during the quarter. With the European marketplace showing signs of improvement, we saw our international advertising accelerates, and improving macro environment, coupled with our investment in original programming and new channels, should position us well for long-term growth in our international operations. In terms of affiliate fees, we continue to reach long-term agreements with our distribution partners that position us for growth, as well as for consumption of our content on digital platforms. We secured additional carriage for our EPIX pay TV service, and we are encouraged by the incremental opportunities we see to monetize our brands with new distribution partners.", "Paramount continues to develop tentpole franchises, and we are excited about the upcoming slate and development pipeline, as well as the studios plans to develop new revenue streams. And we continue to find the opportunities to drive efficiencies throughout our businesses in order to enhance our margins and drive earnings per share and free cash flow. These efforts, combined with our aggressive return of capital, will continue to drive value for our shareholders.", "And with that, I will now turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I have a question for Philippe. You guys are the first pure-play cable networks to report and you talked about some weakness in the quarter around November in advertising pacings. Could you provide a little more information of what happened, did you think, in the fourth quarter? I know you ended the third quarter really strong, so when you looked at what happened in the fourth quarter, what was -- what do you think the drag was from? And then when we look at the first quarter, I think Easter is about 150 basis points impact on a quarterly comps, if you can just give us, is that the right type of drag you have and you're going to grow even despite that comps? I just wanted to hear what you said about the quarter and why do you think that was?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Michael. As far as November, remember, we were coming out of the continued budget discussions in Washington as we were coming out of October. And that just created a lot of uncertainty in the business community. You had companies who were feeling uncertain, trying to make their years and retrenching a bit. That dissipated once the budget deal occurred and we started seeing strength again in December and certainly continuing into this quarter, where demand is back to normal. As far as the move of Easter from this quarter to the next, yes, it has probably a little over 150 basis points of drag -- of headwinds in this quarter. Of course, it'll be a tailwind in the next quarter. But despite that, we will see absolute growth, sequential improvement in ad sales growth from December quarter, and we see good strength in demand in the marketplace right now. And of course, we're off to a great start on our ratings.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just I guess a couple of questions, Philippe. Netflix announced it would've significant European launches later this year. Is that a meaningful incremental revenue opportunity for Viacom? Or is that sort of already expected? And I'm curious if you think that 2014 will be the year that a virtual MVPD gets launched? Sony's talked about launching something and how that would impact Viacom's businesses?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Welcome, Doug. While whether it's Netflix or Amazon, or local players, over-the-top players in different countries around the world, there is clearly an expansion of this new distribution marketplace. It's an opportunity for us to monetize our global library. It was U.S.-based product or more and more original content that we are producing abroad. And that can only be good for a company like ours, who produces a lot of content. So yes, it will over time continue to be an incremental opportunity for us. As far -- I do think, obviously, I don't control what companies do, but based on a variety of discussions that we're having, I do believe that there'll be at least one virtual MVPD player commencing operations in 2014. And once again, that is a good opportunity for us to enter into a new relationships with emerging distributors to add to our stable of the existing ones. So all of these are good incremental opportunities over time. Obviously, they're small when they launch, but they can build over time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "You spent some time talking about some of the international initiatives, launch of Paramount, consolidating Italy, launching Russia, Brazil. Can you give us a sense of the lift you think you could get to revenues from all those things on both on ad side and then affiliate side? And what the impact -- is it a lift? Is it a headwind in the initial years on the operating income side?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, clearly it's a lift on the revenue side. We are taking every opportunity as we have renewals or even before renewals of affiliate deals to add distribution, not just for the Paramount Channel and the launches that we talked about for MTV in Russia and Brazil and so forth, but additional Nickelodeon channels where we can leverage a content library around the world that really works very well. So again, I talked about it in the past, but where we have Nickelodeon, we've been adding Nick Jr. and Nicktoons, and looking at other opportunities to leverage all this great content we are producing. And clearly, when you do channel launches, there are some expenses, startup expenses associated with those launches. But it's really setting ourselves up for really fast growth over a period of years. We are focused on building significant asset value over time around the world, and it's very exciting where we're doing very, very well in growing our footprint.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just going back to your commentary about acceleration in domestic ad growth in the March quarter, how much of that do you think is coming from the strength you mentioned about the stronger demand and the marketplace, sort of helped your marketplace overall versus maybe some potential improvements in ratings at MTV given your strong start to a couple of new shows?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, clearly, the strength of our ratings is important and MTV is off to a good start in the quarter and several of our other networks, including COMEDY CENTRAL and SPIKE and CMT. Really across-the-board, we are seeing some good strength. We also provide the best opportunities in the business to our advertising clients and integrated marketing. We made an announcement about Viacom Velocity. But that's not the beginning. That's just the continuation of the increased investment that we have made in integrated marketing, creating content for our marketing partners. And that's also driving growth in ad revenues and deepening our relationships with our marketing partners. And we keep adding new shows, new events. So later in the year, we're going to have a big new Nickelodeon event, the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Sports Edition in the summer. And those events allow us, again, to have additional conversations with existing and new advertising partners.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just saying -- and just a follow up on MTV, do you have any sense on how much of the viewership in MTV is sort of a delayed viewing and how much you could potentially see a lift, therefore, from the final rollout of the cross-platform system by Nielsen by the end of the year?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "You raised a very good issue because increasingly, there should be less focus on the live same day ratings. A lot of shows see a lot of lift in the C3 period, and so the C3 ratings, which, of course, are the ones we monetize, particularly for a lot of our original shows, really see a nice lift. We are very encouraged by Nielsen working to get to a more effective multiplatform measurements, and we are working with them as a test of the new services that they are providing to programmers, and that will provide additional monetization opportunities for us, particularly as we are rolling out our TV Everywhere functionality with distributors. And accordingly, we'll have more monetization opportunities on different platforms.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Bryan Wieser of Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Actually, I did have a question on velocity. More specifically, I was wondering, is there any way you could dimensionalize what percentage of your ad revenues or campaigns or anything like that, that you sell in a, let's call it, an enhanced manner? In other words, it's more than just about the tonnage, it's about something like what Velocity is trying to do. And secondly, I was wondering on the European advertising, I was wondering if there are any particular countries of particular strength of performance versus your average in particular countries that are underperforming than average?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "So, Bryan, your first question, there's really no way to dimensionalize. It's really a part, it's a special sauce that we provide to our advertising and marketing partners. And it gets us in the door, it enhances it. But it's becoming a normal part, increasing part of our value proposition with the marketers. As far as European advertising, we're seeing really solid strengths also driven by ratings, by the way, in the U.K., throughout Northern Europe. We're seeing stabilization in Southern Europe with some signs of emerging growth there. So it's expansioning the decline in the countries that were having difficulties over the last few years and greater velocity in countries that were relatively stable during that period.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Maybe relatedly, do you think the Olympics in Sochi makes any impact on some of the European markets in the quarter?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "To some degree, but it's temporary. Certainly, it was planned for and it's a little bit of a drag during that period in the quarter, but underlying that, we have good momentum.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the lumpiness of affiliate fees that's tied to Internet deals. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of timing that could affect the next couple of quarters? Is there anything that you can talk to at this point?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, again, it's really hard to use a word that Bryan used, to dimensionalize that because a lot of this is tied to product availability and some of the distributors involved request availability at certain time periods. But that does add a level of lumpiness that you don't see in the traditional affiliate agreements, which are the baseline. And that's why we stick to the full-year guidance, which we've been comfortable giving year after year of high-single digits to low-double digits affiliate growth. And we continue to see that guidance as being the underpinning of our affiliate revenue stream.", "Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay, all right. Let me switch gears a little bit then. On the TV production focus, could you talk a little bit about where you see the real opportunity? I mean historically, the money has been in broadcast level shows, but I think the new opportunity is for more shows on Internet platforms and on cable networks. Where is your focus going to be on the TV side and how much of an opportunity do you see there?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Our TV production group at Paramount is, it's first creatively driven. They've had an amazing amount of interest from the creative community. Some were involved with the studio on the film side, some of them were more traditional television writers and directors and producers. So there are discussions going on with the over-the-top players, with pay services, really both in the U.S. and international players because we do want to marry both when it comes to dramatic series, for example. And for cable networks, including, for certain projects, our own, as we continue to increase our ambitions and scripted original programming. And then of course, to the extent that there are some broadcast opportunities, we'll look for those. So you'll see there are a number of projects that are close to green lighting and the Paramount will be making some announcements over the months to come.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Richard Greenfield of BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "EPIX is an interesting topic. I think even we were pretty critical of the original decision or skeptical of the original decision. Your distribution has gotten pretty wide and I'm -- it seems like you've got a couple of major issues to deal with over the next couple of years and I'm curious how do you think about them. One, with the Time Warner deal, I assume you're going to move now into original programming. Curious how much the partners are willing to commit and kind of how you're going to approach building out original programming to really differentiate it from just being a movie distribution service? And then two, I think your deal with Netflix is up in summer of 2015. They've talked about the lack of interest or less interest in noninclusive programming, yet they seem to be marketing a lot of the EPIX product now on the movie side pretty aggressively. I'm just wondering how you think about the importance of continuing that Netflix relationship or whether there is other ways to continue to drive the value out of EPIX through your MVPD partners?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Richard, and thank you for your comments about EPIX. Yes, EPIX has been a very successful new venture for us and our partners, Lionsgate and MGM. It was profitable within a year of launch, and it has continued to grow since then. And we've been patiently expanding the distribution that will continue. It's working well for the distribution and, of course, that's proof of concept and helps us to build distribution over time. Movies are the underpinning, and EPIX has a particularly strong lineup of movies when you consider the great franchises that all 3 partners have, whether it's all these franchises we talked about in our earnings remarks for Paramount and when you think about a Hunger Games from Lionsgate or the Bond Pictures from MGM. It's perhaps the best lineup of any pay service in the marketplace. As we have increased, certainly with Time Warner Cable being a big step in the so-called traditional distribution, the time is near to -- for us to expand our original programming lineup. We already have original programming on EPIX, but we are talking, the partners are talking about getting into scripted series programming at EPIX, and you'll see that coming to help cement and further grow the economics of EPIX. As far as distribution arrangements, whether it's Netflix or Amazon or others that we have, we think it's a desirable service for everyone, and we of course will engage in private discussions and negotiations with all of our distributors about the future. But I'm quite confident that EPIX will see even better times ahead.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "And could you just update us on who you're missing major distributor-wise as you start 2014? Who are the big ones?", "Philippe P.

Is there any impact that we might see either on how you program during that time period, or any expected impact on ratings or revenue during that time period? That's the first question. And then secondly, Wade, I think you said international advertising was the -- growth was partly organic and partly from new channels. Can you give us a breakout of what was the contribution from organic growth versus the new channel?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "That question, Wade, the last one?", "Wade C. Davis", "The impact in the quarter from new channel launches was actually relatively small, just because the channel launches occurred towards the end of the quarter. So in terms of breaking out a specific amount, I'm not sure that we're prepared to do that, but I think, suffice to say, it was relatively de minimis.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "As far as the Olympics, it's predictable. The Winter Olympics don't have as much of an impact as the Summer Olympics. The location means, the time -- big time difference, which will impact the Olympics effect on us. And so our networks -- we'll program accordingly, highly predictable and as we discussed earlier as far as the ad revenues, we continue to see sequential improvement overall in the quarter.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I have a 2 quick ones. You seem to be very happy with your deal with Time Warner Cable. I was wondering if the potential sale of Time Warner Cable, in whole or in part, is a threat to the terms that you got there? And then the second question is on international networks. Can it be that the improving economics of international networks can help you move your sort of historical margin expansion target above 35 basis points or so a year?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you for your questions. As far as the Time Warner Cable deal, obviously, we concluded the extension in the midst of the focus on M&A related to the company. We don't think that a deal would have a significant impact on us, and we look forward to seeing what happens as a result of what's going on now. As far as the international networks, we are continuing to drive efficiency there as we do domestically, but we're also going to be opportunistic about increasing our footprint, and clearly, we're not going to -- so we're driving revenue. We're driving margins on our existing networks internationally, but we will take every opportunity that we see to launch new networks and when we launch a network that has an opposite effect on our margins. But that's really excellent for the long-term health of that group. So, yes, that makes it a little hard to predict the velocity of margin improvement, but over the long term as we do this, clearly, we will emerge with a margin improvement as we build this business.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Vijay Jayant of ISI Group.", "David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "This is David Joyce for Vijay. 2 topics. On your new network launches internationally, I was wondering what the revenue mix is between affiliate and ad revenue right now and where do you see that going with these new launches? And then secondarily, you had mentioned dynamic ad insertion as part of your Time Warner Cable deal. Can you talk about when you think that will be impacting the industry in terms of Nielsen, looking at, I think, at the VOD viewership and the relative impressions in ad revenue that could come from that?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Welcome, David. As far as new launches, every the marketplace is different, so we look for the revenue maximizing mix depending on the market. So for example, on making decisions on whether we go to pay television distribution or free over the air, yes, we look at the bottom line. Free over the air, obviously, there's no affiliate and higher advertising. But if the -- in a particular country, the affiliate opportunity is stronger, we will sacrifice ad revenues in order to get the affiliate revenue. What we're looking is to maximize results. So it's really a country by country analysis as to what the overall mix. When you blend it all together in a good economic environment, on average, we should grow both at decent rates. And as far as dynamic ad insertion, firstly, the distributors themselves have to have the technological capability. I think with companies like Time Warner Cable, obviously, I let them make their own announcements, but they're very close to implementing that as are other distributors. And then secondly, as we discussed earlier in this call, we are encouraged by Nielsen's imminent progress on measuring multiplatform viewership, and accordingly the ads that appear on these platforms.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tony Wible of Janney Capital Markets.", "Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "The Time Warner deal, are there certain level of marketing commitments associated with the EPIX carriage? And then also, I was hoping you could just recap on mobile advertising and just the rapid shift to it? I know you guys have the mobile apps, but are there other opportunities to monetize that trend?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I'll take the Time Warner Cable question. I'll let Tom answer the mobile advertising one. As far as our agreement with Time Warner Cable, yes, we work together very collaboratively. I think both Time Warner Cable and ourselves are excited about the launch of EPIX, and we are determined to see it succeed as are they. So we will support the marketing, the rollout. We have very strong marketing capabilities that have fueled the success of EPIX with existing distributors, and we'll make that work very positively for Time Warner Cable.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Mobile's a -- huge folks for the company. Our content is doing very, very well in terms of consumption across all mobile devices. Our apps are being churned out very, very quickly across both the iPhone world and the iDevice world and the Android world and as far as an advertising environment, it is very, very valuable inventory that the more we have, the more revenue we can generate for it. So we see great growth potential as our product becomes more widely available across more mobile apps and more mobile devices. So that's a very exciting growth area for the company in the next few years ahead.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. First, on advertising environment, Facebook and Google, obviously, continue to grow pretty significantly, and they have a different product than your channels, of course, but they seem to be focused on some of your core demographics. So I'm curious as to whether you're seeing their growth impacting the competitive marketplace as it applies to your advertising growth potential. And then secondly, on the cost side, with respect to the rating strength that you've seen, is this -- is the success of your programming having a positive impact on your expectations for program spending over the course of the year? Is that -- did that help benefit margins in the first quarter and is that what gives you some confidence in the higher pace of share repurchases this year in terms of capital being freed up?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, on your first question, we work very collaboratively with companies like Facebook, like Twitter on -- in many ways, so from marketing standpoint, programmatic standpoint and we are using them to help drive our ratings and accordingly our monetization and increase the engagement of our viewers who are using multiple platforms in their media lives. So we don't see that impacting our ability to grow. It's up to us to produce a great compelling content, provide great marketing opportunities to reach these audiences who are very attached to our brands. And on the cost side, we have been, over a period of years, we have done 2 things: one, we have increased our investment in programming, but two, we have also gradually shifted the mix at several of our networks from -- in some cases entirely acquired programming to more of a mix of original programming, and that has certainly helped. We'll continue to invest. We are going to grow on a full-year basis our programming expansion in the mid- to high-single digit range. But overall on the cost side, we will continue to manage our cost base prudently, as Tom said earlier, to preserve and enhance our margins.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "And we'll continue to use the excess free cash flow we have on share repurchases. And as everyone knows, our ability to generate excess free cash flow is significant and that's what drives our share repurchase appetite.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And how is that programming expense growth expectation? Is it impacted by the success of the ratings as the year progresses or is it pretty set whether the show's work or not?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "We're always investing in new shows for the new hits that are going to impact the next years and the years beyond, and that really drives the incremental growth and you can never be -- you can never sit on your hands and assume the hits you have today are the hits that are going to carry you into the future.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "The other thing I would like to point out as far as the programming spending is that there are now incremental revenue opportunities on the affiliate side. So investing in programming is just not driving the ratings, it's also an opportunity into the future as you have new launches around the world to monetize what gets added to the library in a way we are unable to do in past years, where there really wasn't for us an incremental monetization opportunity. So we get it -- we get back some of that increased spending on programming through licensing and other revenue opportunities.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tuna Amobi of S&P Capital IQ.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "Tom, is there any reason that we shouldn't expect the same kind of improvement in the ETR that you saw this year, especially with your international ramp up is still ongoing?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "In programming what, Tuna?", "Wade C. Davis", "Effective tax rate.", "Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research", "The effective tax rate.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Well, yes. I think it really depends a lot on how certain movies, one, large movie in particular that we expect to do very well internationally, that would be Transformers 4. The extent to which that has foreign -- overseas profits, revenues and profit, that could impact the tax rate and bring it down a little if it does better than we currently have in the budget.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our March quarter. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.

Redstone", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was another successful quarter for Viacom. Our leading Media Networks and Paramount Pictures continued to attract large audiences all around the world. We have an outstanding management team [indiscernible] every single day.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to the leader of that team, my good friend, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the second quarter of our 2014 fiscal year.", "Viacom had a strong quarter. The company achieved steady growth in quarterly revenues, earnings and operating income. Our media networks delivered strong top and bottom line growth even as we grew our investment in original programming. Ratings were up for the majority of our networks and we saw the successful run of Paramount Pictures' The Wolf of Wall Street, and the #1 debut of Noah, a bona fide global hit.", "Let's take a quick look at our financial performance for the quarter. Tom and Wade will go into greater detail in a moment.", "Revenues increased to $3.17 billion, reflecting both higher affiliate fees of advertising revenues in our Media Networks. Operating income rose 3% to $872 million. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased to $482 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $1.08.", "Viacom's balance sheet is strong. We remain committed to returning significant value to our shareholders while investing in great content and the growth of our business worldwide. In the March quarter, we repurchased $850 million in stock under our ongoing stock repurchase program. This quarter, we also plan to repurchase $850 million in stock, and expect our buyback for the September ending fiscal year to exceed $3.25 billion.", "We are very pleased to announce this morning that we have agreed to acquire the United Kingdom's Channel 5 broadcasting for GBP 450 million to be funded by our international cash on hand. After we close, we expect the transaction will be accretive to Viacom on an operating income basis in the first year. Channel 5's diverse programming slate will complement Viacom's popular pay-TV networks. We believe that we will be able to invest in more programming for Channel 5 that will make the channel even more vibrant and utilize some of that programming on our UK pay channels and even more importantly, on our existing and future networks around the world. We look forward to welcoming Channel 5's accomplished executives and employees into the Viacom family for the very exciting future ahead.", "As I mentioned, our Media Networks had a great quarter. Ratings were up on a year-over-year basis at many of our networks, including Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, VH1, CMT, SPIKE and TV Land. Our Media Networks segment grew total advertising by 3% and domestic advertising by 2% in the March quarter. In the current quarter, we expect domestic advertising to grow mid-single-digits.", "On the distribution side, total affiliate revenue increased by 10% in the quarter, and we concluded with the successful completion of our deal with the NCTC, the National Cable Television Cooperative. We also continue to drive value for distributors by launching new branded apps for our channels, including the recent Comedy Central and BET NOW apps. Across Viacom, our apps were downloaded at a rate of more than 1 million times per month in the March quarter.", "For the second straight quarter, Nickelodeon was the #1 network for kids 2 to 11. Ratings grew 4%, while its 2 biggest competitors saw significant declines. Nickelodeon's ratings have now increased year-on-year for 15 consecutive months. Nickelodeon can lay claim to 8 out of the top 10 shows for kids in the current broadcast season. The network's continued dominance in preschool is a big part of this success. Wallykazam! debuted in the quarter as Nick's highest-rated preschool series and strengthens a formidable lineup which includes PAW Patrol, Dora the Explorer and Bubble Guppies. Nickelodeon also had the top 5 animated series in the March quarter, including the newly launched Breadwinners and of course, SpongeBob SquarePants, which is as strong as ever approaching its 15th birthday. Live action is strong for Nick, too. Sam and Cat gave the network the top-rated show with kids 2 to 11 and The Thundermans and The Haunted Hathaways followed closely on its heels.", "The content pipeline in Nickelodeon is rich. At its recent upfront presentation, the network introduced 10 new series, along with a tent-pole, the Kid's Choice Sports 2014 to be hosted and executive produced by Michael Strahan.", "MTV, more than any network, has an imperative for reinvention. The network must anticipate changing tastes and trends among its young audience. A bold period of reinvention is at hand at MTV. Even as the network continues to launch unscripted hits like Catfish, it is doubling down on scripted fare with a trio of smart, complex new series coming to air this year. Each explores the universally relatable youth theme of self-discovery through a different lens.", "Faking It just debuted as MTV's highest-rated new scripted premiere in 2 years. The show gives a humorous high school take on evolving social attitudes towards sexual orientation. Happyland is a mother-daughter comedy that touches on the Latino experience in America. And Finding Carter is a mystery drama with an absolutely gripping plot that we believe can connect with a very broad audience. These shows will appeal not only to our younger audience, but to their older siblings and young parents as well. Of course, this reinvention also extends to how fans interact and connect with the brand. MTV is undertaking an exciting new initiative to transform the viewer experience. The network is building a new team to focus on real-time interstitial coverage of cultural and social media events each day. Think the quick hit video pieces invented by MTV but produced on-the-fly throughout the day to reflect trending topics, extending the network's always-on dialogue with its audience. MTV is hiring top editorial and design staff, including Richard Turley, the award-winning former creative director of Bloomberg Businessweek, and investing in upgrades to its tech infrastructure to get this concept up and running. It's a fresh new approach, and from a sales perspective, it will shorten commercial pause for our advertisers and allow us to give A positions to multiple clients. It will also enable marketers to buy into trending cultural conversations at the scale that only television can offer.", "Coming off 6 consecutive months of primetime ratings growth, VH1 is working to build consistent strength in Thursday primetime and establish another solid night on Wednesdays to extend the success of its powerhouse Monday night lineup. The network is seeking loud, fun shows with a high celebrity quotient. It has increased its stable of production partners, resulting in 10 new series coming to air through the beginning of 2015. Additionally, VH1 is building on its music movie franchise, successfully launched with CrazySexyCool; with Drumline 2, starring Nick Cannon. Like Being Mary Jane on BET, we think Drumline can pave the way for an ongoing series if it connects with audiences.", "CMT is building on major growth. Ratings were up 26% in the March quarter, with more and more original programming, including 20 hours of programming from its new CMT docks [ph] unit and a new CMT Crossroads with Katy Perry and Kacey Musgraves.", "Without a doubt, Comedy Central is the place right now for young comedic talent. Thanks to its successful investment in new original series, anchored by fresh voices like Key & Peele, Broad City and Inside Amy Schumer; and Chris Hardwick of @midnight, a rethinking of the late night talk show that is growing its audience every month and attracting double the social media traffic of The Tonight Show. Much of this talent, including Amy, came up through what Comedy Central refers to as its farm team system, a roster of young comics and nurtures through sponsored tours, records, home video and Sirius radio channel. New originals have powered Comedy Central to its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year ratings growth. That success is fueling demand on all platforms from the new Comedy Central app to the newly relaunched sites for Daily Show and Colbert.", "Speaking of Colbert, Comedy Central looks forward to sending him off in style in these next 8 months, and we're excited about the opportunity to reinvent late-night television again in the 11:30 slot beginning in 2015.", "SPIKE also continues to see strength from its originals, including its 2 biggest series Bar Rescue and Ink Master. Two new extensions of the Bar Rescue franchise, Hungry Investors and Frankenfoods are coming to Spike in the current quarter.", "At BET Networks, the team is hard at work planning the second annual BET Experience, set for this June in Los Angeles. BET has created a number of new sponsorship opportunities around the festival, which will again serve as a strong promotional platform for the BET Awards. In the current broadcast season, BET has the top 3 sitcoms on cable among adults 18 to 49 with The Game, Real Husbands of Hollywood and Let's Stay Together.", "And CENTRIC, coming off its most-watched quarter ever, recently announced plans to develop a lineup of new original programming for African-American women in partnership with Queen Latifah.", "Internationally, we're reaping benefits from our decision to move MTV Brazil, Italy and Russia to owned and operated models last year. All 3 have grown ratings, revenue and reach in the interim. Overall, our international ad sales grew double digits this past quarter. In the 6 months since its relaunch, MTV Brazil has risen from the 30th to the 16th ranked network in its core demo in a very crowded marketplace. Ratings for MTV Italy grew 31% year-over-year in the March quarter. The March quarter also saw MTV launch in the Philippines, as well as the launch of the Paramount channel in Russia and Hungary. And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, we are truly excited by the potential Channel 5 will bring to us, not just in the U.K., but in our operations around the world.", "Beyond our screens, we are aggressively executing a low-risk licensing strategy for stores and recreation to extend our brand presence globally and continuing to expand our consumer products business to drive our bottom line.", "Moving over to Filmed Entertainment, Paramount Pictures achieved success in the March quarter with the extended run of Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street and the #1 debut of Darren Aronofsky's Noah. Noah continues to be a big hit with international theatergoers as well. The success of these films demonstrates not only their outstanding quality, but also the continued ability of Paramount to connect broad audiences with challenging, creatively ambitious filmmaking.", "Paramount also successfully launched Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, yet another very profitable film from its in-surge label. As we head into the summer tent-pole season, Paramount's exciting release slate includes Transformers: Age of Extinction, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hercules.", "There's great momentum at Paramount Television as well. The unit recently announced its new leadership team with production and development executives who've worked on a wide range of hits from Walking Dead to South Park. And just this week, Paramount Television announced its first major network production, a 3-hour live broadcast of the hit musical Grease for FOX. This gives you an idea of the kind of ambitious and diverse projects the new unit intends to pursue. It also pulled back the curtain on a number of additional projects in development. We have projects inspired by Paramount hits, including The Truman Show and Narc, as well as the Terminator franchise. We are also developing a series based on the best-selling mystery novel The Alienist with the executive producers of True Detective, and a limited run series based on A. Scott Berg's Pulitzer Prize winning biography, Lindbergh. We see a sellers' market for these types of rich, character-driven shows, and we're excited to get them into production.", "To close, Viacom is in great shape. We are positioned for an era of growth for our company. We continue to invest in programming and films that resonate with audiences worldwide and drive the businesses of our marketing and distribution partners. We remain focused on mining the many growth opportunities at hand for content creators, both at home and abroad and on new devices. As a result, we see sustainable, high-single to low double-digit growth at affiliate revenues, an improving environment for ad sales in the U.S. and abroad, great potential for significant growth in our international business, consumer products revenue and new initiatives at Paramount and throughout our company. As all these initiatives bear fruit, we will continue to deliver results, create value and return substantial capital to our shareholders.", "Thank you, and with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade C. Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 6% compared with the prior year, principally driven by increases in affiliate and advertising revenues. Domestic revenues were up 6%, while international revenues grew 10%. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "In terms of advertising, domestic revenues were up 2% in the quarter and international revenues increased 14%. The growth in international advertising reflects the impact of new channels, as well as continued improvement in the European marketplace. In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues increased 11% in the quarter, while international revenues were up 7%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew high-single-digits in the quarter. Growth in the international revenues was due to increases in subscribers, new channel launches, as well as higher rates. Expenses increased 5% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 5%. SG&A expense increased 6%, reflecting advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of original series and specials, as well as the impact of new channels in international markets.", "Media Networks' adjusted operating income was up 9%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 40%, an increase of approximately 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The margin increase was driven by top line growth of 6%, partially offset by 5% growth in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 12% in the quarter, principally due to declines in home entertainment and theatrical revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues decreased 17%, reflecting lower carryover revenues from prior quarter releases. Home entertainment revenues declined 30%, principally due to fewer releases in the quarter, as well as lower carryover revenues. Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $11 million in the quarter, as compared to $65 million last year. The decrease principally reflects the number and mix of current year releases.", "In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 33%, reflecting a 150-basis-point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of domestic versus international profitability.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Wade. Good morning, everyone. Let me talk about our cash flow and debt profile, as well as the return of capital to shareholders. I'll also cover the seasonal factors that impact the remainder of our 2014 fiscal year.", "For the quarter, we generated $524 million in operating free cash flow compared to $700 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in operating free cash flow for the quarter was principally due to higher cash taxes and cash interest. The increase in cash taxes was primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments during the year. As for our debt, it is principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%.", "During the March quarter, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to maintain our leverage ratio at our target level by issuing a total of $1.5 billion of senior notes and debentures in a combination of 5-, 10- and 30-year maturities. On April 3, a portion of the new issuance proceeds was used to redeem the $600 million of outstanding 4.375% senior notes that were due September of 2014. The new debt was issued at an average rate commensurate with our overall cost of debt, and taken together with the redemption, allowed us to extend our weighted average maturity.", "In terms of short-term funding needs, to the extent, we have incremental borrowings. We are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 20 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end. As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.4 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1x. But taking into consideration the April 3 redemption of the $600 million of senior notes, our leverage ratio was 2.9x, and of course, our cash balance decreased to $2 billion. At March 31, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "Our commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the March quarter. During the quarter, we returned a total of $850 million of capital back to our shareholders, and we ended the quarter with 432 million shares outstanding. For the June quarter, we are on a pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock, which means that for the first 9 months of the year, we will have returned a total of approximately $3 billion to our shareholders.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continue to see long-term annual growth in the high-single-digit and low-double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the June quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will be flat compared to the prior year. However, we expect that affiliate revenue will grow double-digits in the September quarter. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid- to high-single-digits. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.", "For 2014, we are now forecasting a book tax rate of 33%, reflecting the mix of domestic versus international profitability. At Filmed Entertainment, we are very excited about our upcoming summer tent-pole releases including Transformers: Age of Extinction, Hercules and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.", "Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline, we are currently in production on the hybrid, live-action and CGI animated film, Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge and is scheduled for release in May of 2014. We have started production on a Terminator reboot, which is in coproduction and partnership with Skydance and we recently wrapped production on The Gambler, which stars Mark Wahlberg in the lead role.", "The studio is also currently in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including Mission: Impossible, Star Trek, G.I. Joe and World War Z.", "In summary, we continue to invest in our brands and franchises, developing new revenue streams and diversifying existing ones.", "At Media Networks, we continue to grow our global footprint, launching new channels and apps in the international marketplace. Nickelodeon continues to grow its consumer product and licensing businesses, having developed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into the #1 live-action figure in the United States. And the launch of the new animated series Dora and Friends this summer and Paramount's release of the SpongeBob Movie early next year will create new merchandise and licensing opportunities for these enduring franchises.", "At Filmed Entertainment, we will release the first titles from our in-house animation division in 2015 and in conjunction with this, the studio will be developing merchandising opportunities tied to these films. Paramount's also getting back into the television production business, seeking to capitalize on increasing demand for original content from broadcast, cable and pay TV networks. These initiatives will enhance both our top and bottom line growth, and combined with our focus on managing cost and returning capital, we will drive additional value for our shareholders.", "With that, I'm going to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.", "Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So Philippe, a couple of questions. First, can you talk a little bit more about the conversations you're having with advertisers around the upfront process and what your expectations might be for price per volume this year? And I was at The Cable Show, there was a lot of discussion around putting Netflix and the other SVOD providers as a channel in the cable box. And as you approach your conversations and your modeling around -- since you guys are the arms suppliers, the likes of Amazon, the licensees that you are charging, did you consider the fact or are you worried at all about the fact that there could be increased viewership competition as those guys start to get integrated in the cable box over time?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Doug. As far as our heading into the upfront, we've had some very successful presentations to advertisers. I mentioned in my remarks all the new series and events that we have planned across our networks, including our major ones, like Nickelodeon, MTV, where we had blockbuster presentations, but also some of our other networks that people generally don't think much about like CMT. So we are very well positioned based on the strength of the programming across the board. We see an improving environment as we go forward, so we anticipate very successful upfront market for us. And many of the categories that are showing strength are the categories that are squarely in our wheelhouse, like electronics, wireless, the kids' marketplace, the movies, the way they're skewed for the rest of the year and into next year, the kind of franchise that are out there. So we see a lot of opportunity as we look forward. As far as the SVOD distributors, we always face competition. We live in a world where we are suppliers of programming, as you so aptly put it. We are, to some degree, the arms merchants. We can be selective in what we provide, what we make available when, how, the content that we put on the SVOD operators serve to promote new episodes, new seasons, new shows, drive our consumer products business. There are a lot of aspects to how we distribute our programming on different windows. And as far as competition goes, we live in a competitive world. It is our core strength to build brands and great programming, and we are just continuing to step up the pace on that, and the results show. We see a lot of opportunity. You focus on the set-top box, we see opportunities beyond that in the mobile environment; not just in the U.S. but around the world. And we have geared our whole organization to play successfully in that world.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. The first one is on the acceleration of domestic advertising growth that you're seeing in the fiscal third quarter. I guess, what specifically is driving that? Is it the healthier marketplace? Is it better movie slate in that quarter? Is it Easter to a certain degree? And will that continue for the rest of the year?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you, Alexia. Well, many of the factors that you mentioned, we did see some movie releases move out of the March quarter into the next couple of quarters. So certainly, that will help us, given what a strong category that is. You're quite right that Easter is in this quarter and certainly, in particular, for the Nickelodeon business, that makes a difference as we had in this quarter. And as I mentioned in answer to Doug's question, some of our key categories are strengthening categories. When you look at the competitive environment that exists in mobile, wireless, in electronics, in quick service restaurants, the breakfast meal wars and all these competitive categories, these provide strength for us. And of course, the strength of our networks, as well as the integrated marketing capabilities that we are providing to our advertisers. We are the leaders in that, and that is exactly what advertisers are looking for. And we are going to them with those offerings. We are getting more deeply embedded with social media and providing entire packages. So that's serving us well currently and will serve us well as we look into the next broadcast year in the upfronts.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just to follow up, if I can, on the acquisition. You guys have been really very aggressive in your buybacks historically, at least the last few years. And I guess, given this acquisition, I guess, can you update us on your priorities for use of cash going forward? I know you mentioned the buybacks for this year. Do you still expect to be that aggressive going forward? And I guess, maybe any commentary if we should expect further acquisitions or how the pipeline looks.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, let me emphasize, we have a strong commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. Now as I've always said, we don't see any big, transformative transactions in our future, but we do look for targeted opportunities and intellectual property and in the international environment. This Channel 5 opportunity, in a very strong market in general, and for us, in particular, just really fit the bill. It will be accretive right away and it's done well. We think we can take Channel 5 and its family of networks to the next level, utilizing some of the programming and capabilities that we have on our pay channels in the U.K., taking advantage of the vibrant U.K. production marketplace. We are going to step up, as we are doing around the world, in our production activities, increase the mix of original programming. That will allow us to grow the U.K. business and will provide us with another bucket of programming that we can distribute across Continental Europe and around the world, including the U.S., given what a fount of creativity there is in Britain. So we're excited by the fact that this increases our potential. And as a global company, we have the ability to take what has heretofore been a local business into a much bigger place. So we're very excited. This will add to our operating income, add to our growth, and...", "Wade C. Davis", "Alexia, let me just add to Philippe's remark, I mean, it's a great strategic transaction, but it's also very elegantly structured from a financial point of view. And that will have -- the cash being used here is not cash that would've been available for the share buyback program. These are international proceeds that are pretty much kept offshore, and as a result, they were invested at rates that are sub-1%, very conservative investment return. So this investment will yield a very high incremental return of -- in terms of what it offers shareholders and the company. And it's kind of unique in that regard in terms of its characteristics, and it also comes with about GBP 125 million of net losses that we can apply to future income here. So it's a very attractive transaction from a financial point of view, and Philippe outlined all the strategic attractive elements of it, but it will not impact the buyback program at all.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I have a couple on Channel 5, and can I just ask one to Tom quickly? When you guys say it's accretive, are you assuming something for amortization within that accretion? Or is it accretive on cash EPS and cash earnings?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Michael, we think about half of the purchase price is goodwill. We have to actually go through a valuation exercise to get exactly the right numbers. But for modeling purposes, you could take about half of the purchase price, allocate it to goodwill and the balance of the purchase price would be amortized somewhere between 10 and 15 years.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. And then I have 2 for Philippe on Channel 5. One is, I believe in the U.K, Viacom uses BSkyB as their sales agent versus Channel 5 sells directly to the market. How do you think you guys will integrate Channel 5 sales team into your network business, and that's one?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Michael, our current intention is to continue with business as usual in the ad sales house. They have operated very successfully. Of course, we just signed the agreement yesterday. We are moving forward. Our real focus in making this acquisition was the combined programming opportunities, distribution opportunities, the cross-marketing opportunities that we see here. For example, there's a very successful children's block on Channel 5 called Milkshake! It has some Nickelodeon programming on it now. We think by marrying Milkshake! with some of the Nickelodeon capabilities and programming, there is opportunity to grow both sides of the house once we are able to close this transaction. So that's really been our focus. And again, it's a broadcasting asset that can work well with our pay channels, but it has its own characteristics.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay, and then the other question would be, you mentioned the original programming, is there any history or any financial history of them selling their content overseas either to other networks or SVOD? Or is that simply untapped financial opportunity?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I think to some limited degree, thus far, I think it's an untapped opportunity. So as you look forward, we will, as we do, we tell you consistently that Viacom's overall programming investment is growing at mid-single to high-single-digits every year. I think that's a good prospect in the U.K. for us to do that. And as we increase our investment across our networks in the U.K., we will also probably shift the mix toward more original programming. And that will allow us to enrich the programming experience in the U.K, but also allow for greater monetization given that this will be more programming that we own. And I believe we'll be able to use and re-purpose some of that programming in our U.S. channels. And another exciting thing to me, as you know, we are planning to launch more brands internationally, and the programming that we develop in the U.K., when added to the programming we develop in the U.S. and the local programming we produce in other geographies, will accelerate our ability to launch new brands, targeted at new demographics around the world.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Richard Greenfield of BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First off, when you look at calendar Q1, you mentioned that the movie schedule was light or things got pushed out. But are there anything kind of uniquely when you look at calendar Q1, that seems to make it one of your slower quarters advertising-wise versus other quarters throughout the year? And then just a big picture conceptual question. Sports programming seems to be something that all of your peers seem to be focusing more of their time and attention on. You've obviously done a little bit for SPIKE. But just wondering your appetite for increasing your overall exposure to sports programming to ensure or accelerate your subscriber fees.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you. Thank you, Rich. Yes, there were some movies that did move out of calendar Q1 or fiscal Q2. But also, if you look back on last year and the year before, you do see in the general marketplace, this time of year end of first calendar quarter, beginning of second calendar quarter, you see a pattern of what the demand is in the marketplace for a variety of reasons, and then it builds as the calendar second quarter continues. And we are seeing that, particularly in categories that we have particular relative strength in. As far as sports-related programming, one, yes, as you point out, we have some participation in that. But as you look at some of the programming that we have, for example, the new event that we're going to have on Nickelodeon, hosted by Michael Strahan, The Kids' Choice Sports 2014, that takes advantage of the vibrancy of sports. If you look at MTV2, we have programming tied in with Major League Baseball that -- they are very interested in working with us. So we are looking at opportunities where we can. There may be some opportunities internationally as well, and that was one of the rationales behind our getting involved with Bellator here in the U.S. We see that as potential programming as we roll out the SPIKE brand, if we roll that out internationally, that would be a natural there. So we look at those opportunities, but we're very focused on having a broad range of programming that has that live event -- that eventized appeal like sports does. So that could be the [indiscernible], but it could also mean fresh series that animate social conversation. So it's really not so much of sports, it's really having fresh, current vibrant content of all kinds, including sports-related content, that counts.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "It seems like the last couple of years, there has been generally lower volumes of scatter budgets available if advertisers try to lock in higher [ph] budgets and share in advance. I was wondering if that's what you're seeing, that there's still just a lower volume of budget share up for grabs in scatter in general? Separately, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about TV license fees. There's growth there for the first quarter in a while and so I'd love to hear what you think is what's driving that.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "What was the second question? I didn't quite hear it.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I apologize for the background noise here. I was wondering about TV license fees. We saw growth there for the first quarter in a while, so I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what's driving that?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "The license fees in the -- in which part of our business?", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I'm sorry, in the studio.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "The studio. Okay, thank you. Well, as far as the scatter market, it really depends on what categories you're looking at, and there's not a constant theme there. It really depends on what categories become competitive, what the plans year-to-year are of different major advertisers. There have been some years where major advertisers have decided to make a large commitment in the upfront; in other years, they decided they were just going to play the scatter market. So there's no particular rule to follow there in the broader market, and of course, we have different areas of strength in that market. As far as the TV license fees' strength, when you look at the opportunities for content and new networks being created around the world, including our own, that presents new opportunities for Paramount. And a lot of it also depends on the cycle of existing deals.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Product availability.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes. Product availability with licenses when they get -- they're up for renewal, particularly on different packages in movies as we go ahead in the pay license cycle. So there are a number of opportunities, and this year, Paramount has, as the year progresses, a number of opportunities in play.", "Operator", "Our next question will come Vijay Jayant from International Strategy Investment Group.", "David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "This is David Joyce for Vijay. I was just wondering if you can provide some more color on Channel 5. What their revenue stream mix is like there compared to the other European assets? When the carriage agreements might be coming due? And then separately, in the U.S., there's been an increase in uptake of skinny packages probably capturing some of the people who may be cord cutters or cord narrowers. I'm just wondering if there's been any impact on your subscriber base there?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, so as far as Channel 5, the very large majority of revenues there, just to size it for you, the revenues of Channel 5 is approximately, in U.S. dollar terms, about $600 million as of this past year. It's largely advertising. This is a broadcast family of channels, and it's public sector broadcasting channel in the U.K. So think of it in that way as compared to our pay networks, where we also have affiliate revenues. This is largely driven by that, as well as some other revenues relating to programming and consumer products, where by the way, we see some opportunities to enhance our consumer products business by promotion on Channel 5. As far as your question relating to the so-called cord cutters. Look, we live in an environment where we are seeing our affiliate revenues grow. We are very encouraged by the fact that distributors are providing more robust TV Everywhere capabilities, meaning that users in general, and in particular the young viewers, which support many of our networks, will be able to access programming in the way they want and we believe that will entice people who are starting out without these broader subscriptions to subscribe as they get older. We've always seen some delay in young people getting out into the workplace and signing up for subscriptions, so that's not in and of itself a new phenomenon. But we are also providing content and we will be providing more content directly on mobile devices. But I think you will see more reinforcement of the subscription model as more functionality is implemented by the distribution community.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I just wondered if you could talk about -- in your last call, you had said you expected acceleration in the quarter in domestic ad growth, and just what changed -- you mentioned some movies moving out of the quarter, maybe that was it, but if there's anything else that affected the ad growth in fiscal Q2?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Doug, that was really the difference for us in terms of having improved ad sales growth domestically in this quarter compared to last quarter. So that was -- there were a lot of ins and outs. But if you can pinpoint one thing for us, that would be it, given how important the movie category is to us. Now the converse of that is that the date changes on these movies pushed them into the latter half of our year. So on a full year basis, we will benefit from the marketing relating to those movies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vasily Karasyov of Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Tom, I have a 2 part question for you about consumer product licensing. In your prepared remarks, you highlighted all those opportunities coming up in the next several quarters. So looking at your ancillary revenue in the networks for the past couple of years, that -- it looks pretty flattish. So are those new opportunities, are they a result of some renewed focus on this revenue stream for you? And then after that, can you tell us what competition is like in the market, because I'm sure you know every peer of yours is hoping for growth in the consumer product license category, Frozen and the Marvel characters and Star Wars at Disney, DreamWorks Animation with Dragon 2 and so on and so on. How do you see the market? Is there -- is competition benign enough for you to count on substantial success there?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "That's a good question, Vasily. Thank you for it. We do see this category, both from a revenue and a bottom line contribution, increasing both throughout the rest of this year and certainly, into the future years. And it is competitive, but that's why it's important to have something -- a franchise like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where you're #1. And I think that will continue to be our focus. And as you noted in my remarks and I noted in my remarks, we continue to focus on franchises that have very much a toyetic appeal that will put us as a very competitive player in that marketplace. Until those shows, movies get made and get up and on the air, it'll be hard to predict the outcomes, but we're in this business for the long run. We see the tremendous success others have had in it. We put in place in the organizations to take advantage of it, and we have great content and IP to drive that business into the future.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "But you don't feel like that ship has sailed and you're late to the game and the market is taken over by competitors and there's just no room for your properties there?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "I mean, it's not a question of room. It's a question of which properties resonate with the kids. And our goal and given our franchises and, certainly, having a very strong franchise in terms of being able to platform that product with children in general, so like Nickelodeon, that is a big opportunity for us. In the rest of ancillary revenue though, some of the growth that consumer products will drive will be offset by some of the declines in home entertainment and the ability to sell product in that marketplace as DVD sales related to the Media Networks side of the house continue to decline.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I guess I would add on that is as you see some stabilization strengthening in European consumer markets and growth of retail in emerging markets, that creates a bigger pie in consumer products as we look forward in the years ahead.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I guess, on Channel 5, can you guys give us a sense for what the margins of that business looks like today, or how it might compare to your core international portfolio today? And I think Philippe, you've talked about a 30% OICAGR before your international portfolio pre-Channel 5 over the several years. Can you just talk about how this asset may or may not lift that growth outlook if you see sort of retransmission fee [indiscernible] trajectory we've seen in the U.S. taking place in the U.K. And then, Tom, I don't know if you'd be willing to give this to us on the advertising side, but can just remind us of the Easter shift in dollars? I'm trying to get a sense for what -- from the March to June quarter trend is if we normalize for Easter on the domestic ad front.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Ben, let me pick up, and then Tom will follow-up on the Channel 5 and international in general. So what I've said on our international business is that we expect to see that grow strong double-digits looking forward. And as reflected in the Channel 5 investment, we are committed to growing our international business primarily organically, but where we see opportunities that are very additive like Channel 5, and these opportunities do not present themselves often, we will take advantage of that, and that will certainly accelerate our growth. We just signed the agreement to buy Channel 5. We have some ideas on how we can grow and invest in that business. And certainly, our good executives on both sides of the house have some good ideas, but in the months to come, as we move toward closing the transaction, we will gel a plan to see how we can grow that U.K.-based business. And let me just repeat how committed we are to growing and investing in our U.K. business and what exciting opportunities there are ahead. And we think that Channel 5 will be a very complementary part of our global content and branded distribution business. Tom?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Specifically, Ben, the margin on Channel 5 is consistent with the margin of our total international business, and that's low- to mid-teen type margins. And we do believe that, as Philippe said, that we can have expansion in both the margin of our entire international business and the margin of Channel 5 as we move forward in growing international marketplaces.", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then on the domestic ad question?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Sorry, what was it again?", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just as you normalize Easter, can you just remind us how much dollars that usually is...", "Andrew Borst - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's about 1.5 points of growth, 1.5 points of growth that shifts.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So much of the content on Channel 5 seems to be stuff that they're licensing from others. I know you've talked about the opportunity to tap more into kind of local U.K. production. I was just wondering if you could highlight for us what are kind of the key shows that they're making over there that might make sense to think about taking back to the U.S. or moving to other markets? What are the key content franchises you're getting?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Barton, yes, as you pointed out, there are a lot of acquired programming there. I mean, for example, the Big Brother franchise is very popular there. They got CSI and other acquired U.S. programming, as well as in U.K. There is some original production taking place. It's been just a very recent investment on their part in that regard, so we're going to continue that direction. And as we look for programming and commission programming from the very diverse creative community there, we will look for shows that will work, obviously, first and foremost, on Channel 5, but we will have an eye to the kind of shows that will also live well in different windows in the U.K., but on our other networks around the world. We think there's a lot of possible cooperation between our U.S., for certain of our networks, between the U.S. and the U.K. in both directions for Channel 5. So we have the opportunity to just take -- not give up what there is there now, but evolve it. And again, with our orientation toward original programming, we'll be able to accelerate what they've already been doing there.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Barton, it's also important to distinguish while some of them are acquisitions, they are format acquisitions. As in the case of Big Brother, where it's the format of the show, and then they produce that show on their own air, so it becomes their own show with the -- in the version of a Big Brother format. So that's an important distinction. It's not like they just acquire the show that's made here and put it over there.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And that will come from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.", "Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just not to belabor the questions on Channel 5, but I'm just trying to reconcile. So it sounds like you said that you expect margin expansion at Channel 5, but that you also expect to increase the production investment in the U.K. So am I just -- is this just the difference between maybe like year 1 step-up in production expenses, but then you'll get a revenue follow through in successive years to kind of expand margins over the CAGR? Or do you just really expect the revenue acceleration in year 1 to offset the increased production expenses you mentioned? Just trying to kind of reconcile that.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, well, so there is -- as we go forward across all of our channels, we look to grow the revenue pie. And the way to do that is to increase our programming investment. That is the lifeblood of our company. And as we make more programming, we then have the opportunity to find ways to monetize it in various windows, whether it's SVOD, whether it's licensing in other territories and the like. So there's already a programming development taking place. We can look at it, modify, evolve it as we go forward. It's within our existing business plan as well as Channel 5's existing business plan to increase programming investment year after year. That's how you build the business. That's how they built the business to get to this point, and we're not going to interrupt that trajectory. We are going to enhance it.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our earnings call for our June quarter. Joining me for today's discussion are Sumner Redstone, our Chairman; Philippe Dauman, our President and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our CFO. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.", "I want to refer you to Page #2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Sumner.", "Sumner M. Redstone", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Viacom continues to build its leading brand and build outstanding value for its shareholders. As our industry continues to evolve, our management team is keeping right on position for even greater success.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Viacom's CEO, my great, great friend, the wisest man I have ever known, Philippe Dauman.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Thank you very much, Sumner, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter of Viacom's 2014 fiscal year. Viacom is in great shape. Audiences are enjoying our programming in more ways than ever across screens and around the world. Paramount Pictures delivered the global mega hit of the summer in Transformers: Age of Extinction, the highest-grossing film of all time in China, and we continue to return significant capital to our shareholders.", "Let's look at a snapshot of our financial performance for the quarter. Tom and Wade will go into greater depth in a moment. Revenues decreased 7% to $3.42 billion, reflecting revenue declines in Filmed Entertainment, partially offset by increases in Media Networks. Operating income rose slightly to $1.09 billion. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations decreased to $618 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were up 10% to $1.42.", "As always, we maintain a strong balance sheet, allowing us to invest consistently in content across platforms and capture growth opportunities worldwide. And as I mentioned, we remain steadfast in our commitment to returning substantial capital to our shareholders. In the June quarter, we repurchased $850 million in stock under our ongoing stock repurchase program. In the current quarter, we plan to repurchase another $850 million in stock, and expect our buyback for the September-ending fiscal year to total $3.4 billion. Including dividends, we will have returned nearly $4 billion in capital to our shareholders by the close of fiscal 2014.", "Speaking of growth opportunities, a quick update on our acquisition of Channel 5 in the U.K. We're well along in the regulatory process, and we expect the transaction to close by the end of this quarter. In the meantime, we continue to identify content and marketing synergies between Channel 5 and our current network portfolio. As we've said, this acquisition is a fantastic opportunity for us to grow our business in the strong U.K. market with a great free-to-air asset. We're looking forward to our bright future with Channel 5.", "Returning to our results. At our Media Networks, domestic advertising revenue increased 1%, and worldwide advertising increased 2% in the June quarter. In the current quarter, which has a difficult comp against double-digit growth last fiscal Q4, we expect domestic advertising to grow low-single digits.", "It's been widely reported that this year's Upfront selling season was relatively soft, with most networks seeing decreases in volume as a few major advertisers held back dollars. While the market generally was indeed challenging, our Media Networks outperformed, and we grew volume in the low to mid-single digits over last year. This positions us very well for next year. This is a credit to the strength and vibrancy of our brands and our ability to create value for our marketing partners in new, innovative ways. Our new Viacom Velocity Integrated Marketing unit has driven tremendous business for us this year as it develops more and more custom campaigns and content for advertisers and connects advertisers to our huge social media footprint and wealth of data and insights on our audiences. These programs will only grow in importance.", "The recent BET Experience is another great example of how we're creating new opportunities to work with advertisers. In its second year, BET nearly tripled the number of sponsors for the LA-based festival and substantially grew advertising revenue.", "On the distribution side, total affiliate revenue was flat in the quarter, largely due to the lapping of our Amazon Prime deal in the comparable quarter fiscal 2013. Domestic affiliate revenue for traditional distribution grew in the low-double digits. With a strong fourth fiscal quarter, we continue to expect affiliate revenue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits for the full fiscal year.", "In the quarter, we struck a number of distribution deals reflecting the breadth of opportunities at hand for us to serve audiences and monetize content. As we've mentioned, we opened the quarter with a successful renewal of our agreement with the National Cable Television Cooperative, extending our partnership with nearly 800 cable operators and 4.8 million subscribers nationwide. We also struck an agreement with Google Play, covering a wide swath of library content from across our brands. We completed a great agreement with Hulu, renewing our existing deal and bringing the entire library of South Park to the streaming service. Finally, in the current quarter, we secured distribution for EPIX on AT&T U-verse, growing the footprint of the network to nearly 50 million homes nationwide.", "In the June quarter, many networks across television experienced rating softness, including a number of our own. Even in this landscape and amidst heavy competition from sports programming, we did have 2 of the strongest stories in cable in the quarter.", "SPIKE marked its fourth straight quarter of year-over-year ratings growth with Adults 18-49 with increases in every key daypart. In fact, SPIKE achieved the largest year-over-year net ratings gains of any non-sports cable network in the demo. Bar Rescue led the way for the network. Remarkably, the show recorded its highest-rated cycle yet in this, its third season, establishing itself as appointment viewing even among a very crowded Sunday night field. Ink Master also continued to perform well, along with newcomers Catch A Contractor and Hungry Investors.", "VH1 had the second-largest year-over-year net ratings gain of any non-sports cable network in the demo, right behind SPIKE. The network's hit series Hit The Floor and Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta were key drivers of that growth. More recently, VH1 successfully launched a new Thursday primetime lineup, highlighted by the solid performance of Candidly Nicole and the network's complex meditation on romance, vulnerability and human connection in the modern age, Dating Naked.", "As we move forward, we're consistently investing in original content, and bringing more and more new programming to air. Nickelodeon has a torrent of new programming for us coming, including 9 new shows launching from the current quarter through the first quarter of calendar 2015, including the premiere of Dora and Friends this month and new live action series Henry Danger and Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn in September.", "In the period through the critical back-to-school and Hard Eight selling seasons, Nickelodeon has 12 straight weeks of premieres, many of which are returning hit series that powered the network to substantial gains last fall, including Sanjay and Craig, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.", "Nickelodeon also launched a new tentpole in the current quarter with the solid debut of the Kids' Choice Sports awards, which delivered on our expectations and BBSP's in total viewership. Advertisers loved it, too, with a number of the inaugural, as well as new sponsors, already committing to next year's show.", "MTV just debuted its highly anticipated, scripted drama, Finding Carter, which is currently cable's #1 new series of the year with teens and the network's best scripted launch in more than 2 years. Carter is one of the many MTV shows that benefit remarkably from nonlinear viewing. Last week, the show saw a 104% lift in live-plus-3 playback.", "Finding Carter joins the recently renewed Faking It in MTV's lineup of new scripted originals this year, along with the forthcoming Happyland. In addition, MTV has new episodes of hit series, including Teen Wolf, Teen Mom 2 and Ridiculousness this quarter. And of course, the 2014 Video Music Awards air live on August 24. The VMAs have confirmed fantastic performers like Usher and Ariana Grande and already booked greater ad revenue than last year's show.", "In the current quarter, Comedy Central has hit an all-time high in volume of original programming, which now accounts for more than 50% of its schedule. In fact, Comedy is hitting its peak in terms of quantity and quality. It recently earned 21 Emmy nominations, a new best for Comedy Central, which also had more shows nominated than ever before. Remarkably, 4 out of the 6 nominees in the Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series category are Comedy Central shows. One of those series, Key & Peele, returns in the fall, as does the enduring hit, South Park. The sheer volume of original programming we're producing now and the ever-multiplying ways in which we're delivering it to audiences underscore the ongoing transformation of the viewing landscape.", "When we look at video consumption across the many screens we program -- Linear TV, DVR playback, VOD, apps and streaming services -- we see overall viewership outside traditional measurement is growing strongly. This aggregated growth speaks to the continuing demand for high-quality content and the vitality of our brands. It also points to the yet untapped potential we see as new measurement tools are introduced, some as early as next quarter.", "Across Viacom's networks, total video consumption of our full episode programming has grown year-over-year, with a number of our series seeing dramatic lift when you factor in time-shifted and on-demand viewing. Take MTV's Teen Wolf for example, a show with a very tech-savvy audience, an entire online and social media culture onto itself. Live-plus-same-day ratings for the just-completed cycle of Teen Wolf were up 18% among all viewers over the show's debut season in 2011. But when you factor in all measured screens, the total audience of the show is up 38% over the same time frame.", "Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer is another great example. The show grew ratings in its recent second season over its first, but it doubled its total video consumption on nonlinear platforms, VOD, SVOD, and of course, the Comedy Central app. This show does particularly well in the day-4-plus window on VOD, which represents a great opportunity for us as dynamic ad insertion increasingly comes into play.", "Moving on to international. We continue to expand and diversify our brand portfolio across the world. The June quarter saw the launch of a number of new networks, including the Paramount Channel in Romania. We've now launched 28 channels internationally since the beginning of 2013, and we will continue a steady pace of channel launches as we go forward and establish a platform for a much bigger international business.", "We've also benefited significantly from the improved ad market abroad and the strategic moves we made during the economic downturn. International ad revenue increased 20% in the June quarter. MTV Italy continues to be a great story for us, with ratings up 20% since we acquired full ownership of the channel last fall. We launched the Paramount Channel in Spain 2 years ago and it has since grown to become the most-watched network in our international portfolio, with ratings up 50% in June. Currently available in 5 international markets, the Paramount Channel will take another big step forward when it launches in Latin America in November.", "In Filmed Entertainment, the big story at Paramount Pictures is the biggest movie of the year thus far, Transformers: Age of Extinction, which recently surpassed $1 billion at the worldwide box office. The film now stands as the highest-grossing theatrical release of all time in China, a crowning achievement in its phenomenal international run.", "Paramount announced last week that it has extended its first-look deal with film maker, Michael Bay, the visionary behind the multibillion-dollar Transformers franchise and many of the most popular films of the last quarter century. Hercules is also off to a strong start, with a solid debut domestically and internationally. The film will continue to roll out internationally over the next few months.", "And this weekend, Paramount's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hits theaters, which marks another milestone in our revitalization of the franchise since acquiring it in 2009. Following on the heels of the film, Nickelodeon is rolling out 26 new episodes of the animated series, and continues to grow and build out new categories of the very successful Turtles consumer products lines.", "Speaking of Nickelodeon, we announced earlier this week that Paramount Television will produce a live-action TV series based on Paramount Pictures' 2003 musical comedy, School of Rock, for the network. The series, which debuts in the spring of 2015, marks Paramount TV's first foray into children's programming and its first straight-to-series order. This announcement is the latest in a flurry of activity at Paramount's new television unit. We also recently announced that Oscar-winning screenwriter, Dustin Lance Black, will script his forthcoming Lindbergh limited-series event. Additionally, Paramount TV announced a first-look deal with Oscar-winning director, Robert Zemeckis, who has a long and storied history with the studio from Forrest Gump to Flight.", "To close, we see a lot of opportunity at Viacom. We continue to invest more than $3 billion a year in content and connect with audiences that are consuming entertainment in more ways, across more platforms than ever. We're investing to capture growth opportunities, both at home and abroad, whether it's distributing and monetizing our content on new platforms, building or acquiring new networks internationally, or building robust television production, film animation and consumer products businesses. As ever, our focus is to continue to deliver results, create value and return substantial capital to our shareholders.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade C. Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up 1% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues were up 1%, while international revenues grew 2%. Page 10 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were up 2% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were up 1% and international revenues increased 20%. The growth in international advertising reflects the impact of new channels, including MTV and other -- MTV Italy and other channels, as well as continued improvement in the European marketplace.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, domestic revenues were flat year-over-year, while international revenues were down 5%. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic affiliate revenues grew low-double digits in the quarter. The decrease in international revenues was due to the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, partially offset by new channel launches, increases in subscribers and higher subscriber rates.", "Expenses increased 4% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 8%, while distribution and other expenses declined 17% year-over-year. SG&A expenses increased 3%. The decline in distribution and other expenses primarily reflects lower participations related to the timing of product available under certain affiliate distribution agreements.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 3%, and the adjusted operating income margin was 43%, a margin decrease of approximately 180 basis points compared to the prior year. The decline in adjusted operating income primarily reflects lower revenues from certain distribution arrangements and the increase in programming expense during the quarter. The margin decrease was driven by top line growth of 1%, which was more than offset by the 4% overall growth in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were down 26% in the quarter, principally due to the declines in theatrical and home entertainment revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased 43%, reflecting the number and timing of titles in the quarter. We released Transformers: Age of Extinction at the end of the June quarter, while we released Star Trek Into Darkness, World War Z and Pain & Gain in last year's June quarter. Home entertainment revenues declined 24%, primarily due to lower revenue from carryover titles, as well as the current quarter's releases. The decrease in TV license fees of 21% primarily reflects the number and mix of titles available in syndication.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $55 million in the quarter as compared to $17 million last quarter -- last year. The increase principally reflects the number of current quarter releases.", "Moving to taxes. The year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32%, reflecting a 180-basis-point improvement as compared to the prior year. The reduction in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by the mix of domestic and international profitability. In terms of noncontrolling interest, the $43 million principally reflect -- represents the minority interest share of income associated with the renewal of a content distribution agreement.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Thanks, Wade. I'm going to talk about our cash flow and debt profile, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. I'll also cover factors impacting our September quarter.", "For the quarter, we generated $571 million in operating free cash flow compared to $728 million last year. Page 5 of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. Decline in operating free cash flow in the quarter was due to higher cash taxes, which was primarily due to the sunsetting of provisions allowing for accelerated deductions related to domestic film and TV production expense.", "As for our debt, it is principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end of 4.6%. In April, we completed the redemption of the $600 million outstanding of our 4.375% senior notes that were due in September.", "In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. We had no variable rate borrowings at quarter end.", "As for our leverage, we ended the quarter with $12.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.9x. At June 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "Our long-term commitment to return capital to shareholders continued in the June quarter. During the quarter, we returned a total of $980 million of capital back to our shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs, and we ended the quarter with 424 million shares outstanding. For the September quarter, we are on pace to purchase approximately $850 million of our stock, which means that for the fiscal year 2014, we will have returned a total of nearly $4 billion to our shareholders.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the September quarter. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continued to see long-term annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. Accordingly, for the September quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow double digits as compared to the prior year.", "For the full year, we continue to expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the mid- to high-single digits. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins. For 2014, we are now forecasting a booked tax rate of 32%, reflecting the mix of domestic and international profitability.", "Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline, we are in production on the hybrid live-action and CGI-animated film, Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge. We are also in production on a reboot of Terminator, which is a coproduction in partnership with Sky Dance and is scheduled for release in July of 2015. And later this month, we will be going into production on Mission: Impossible V. The studio is also in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises including Star Trek, World War Z and Beverly Hills Cop.", "In summary, we remain committed to investing in our brands, increasing the level of original programming on our networks, and strengthening the connection with our audiences on every screen. Our industry is evolving and consumers have an ever-increasing array of choices and ways to consume our content. Our continued investment in our organization, in our infrastructure, as well as advancements in technology, is enabling us to monetize our audiences as the industry evolves.", "As we partner with distributors, we are increasingly able to deliver targeted ads to our viewers, both in our apps and on VOD through the use of dynamic ad insertion and first-party data. Advertisers are increasingly looking for new and innovative ways to reach their consumers. Our investment in specialized products within our ad sales offering, like Viacom's Velocity and Viacom's Echo, is enabling us to develop unique integrated marketing opportunities that create additional value for our advertisers. As Philippe mentioned, these were instrumental in helping us drive the increased volume in this year's Upfront. These investments and initiatives, combined with our continued focus on driving operating efficiency and on returning capital, will drive value for our shareholders.", "As a matter of fact, if you go back to when we restarted our share buyback program in 2010, through the end of this fiscal year, we will have returned a total of $15.7 billion of capital to shareholders over the full year period. Our market cap, when we restarted the current program, was approximately $22 billion. So this represents a 70% return of capital as compared to our market cap at the start of the program. Our leverage ratio has gone from 1.9x during that period to 2.9x now within -- and it stays within our target range of 2.75 to 3.", "With that, I want to turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first one from John Janedis from Jefferies.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Philippe, you spoke to the soft domestic ad market. On the Upfront, were there particular categories where you gained share? And on the international side, can you speak to profitability and channel launches going forward? Does the Paramount Channel launch plan slow given penetration?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Sorry, what was the last thing about the Paramount Channel brand?", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Does it -- does the Paramount Channel launch plan slow given the penetration increases?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Okay, so in terms of the demand on -- in the advertising marketplace, there were certain advertisers in the consumer goods sector and the automotive sector who chose to either defer or withhold dollars from the upfront marketplace. And at the same time, there was some softness in some of the same sectors in demand in the scatter market. We have strength with many of our traditional advertisers, whether it's the movie category, new -- all the many new devices that are coming out, fast food areas, things like gums and other categories that we are strong in. And as both Tom and I mentioned in our remarks, we were greatly helped by the -- the targeting, the integrated marketing solutions that we were able to offer as part of this Upfront, and we were able to capture dollars and, we believe, gain market share in the Upfront. As far as our international launches, we are benefiting from an upturn in the advertising market, primarily in Europe. We're also benefiting from the channel launches we have done thus far, Paramount Channel being a new brand that we are rolling out. Obviously, as we achieve improving results in international, we are also absorbing the launch cost of Paramount Channels across our international footprint, but that will set a base for -- really enhance the growth as we go forward. So this is a good situation that we're in, in international because we're able to grow our aggregate profitability, while at the same time, investing a lot in our future growth. So we're going to have -- once we establish this brand, we're planning to launch another brand shortly. I've talked before about the SPIKE brand. We will have a much bigger platform, which we'll be able to monetize, both in distribution and advertising, consumer products in the case of our many Nickelodeon brands.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Philippe, I have 2 for you, particularly on the advertising theme, first domestic. This is your third straight quarter of ad growth that's come in weaker than we first expected into the quarter. So what do you think is driving that weakness in scatter? And what do you think improves that scatter in terms over the back half of this calendar year?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, in the case of this quarter where we had, at the beginning of the quarter, we were looking to mid-single digit growth and ended up at 1%. I would say about half of the difference related to the soft demand that we talked about before and half were some ratings issues at individual networks, in our particular case. And that the latter part, we expect to improve as programming rolls out. In terms of the back half, we see an improving economy. We do believe that some of the dollars that were withheld in the general Upfront market will be coming back in the scatter market. Some advertisers made the calculation that, either because of their individual situation or their perception of the general marketplace, that they would not be greatly disadvantaged by waiting for the scatter market and they would gain flexibility by waiting for the scatter market. Some of those advertisers who tried that in some prior years ended up costing themselves more money. We'll see what the future brings, but we do see a continued improvement in the economy. We do see a more competitive sector so we do expect, in that kind of environment, that the scatter market will pick up steam as the year progresses.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay, let me ask you a quick one on international. You mentioned MTV Italy as a helping network. I know you spent a lot of time redoing your MTV Brazil partnership. So are you seeing any benefit now in the ad numbers from Brazil or is that to come?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Yes, MTV Brazil is really -- we've been expanding our distribution there. Our -- the ratings position has improved significantly in Brazil. We are currently in discussions in Brazil to further expand distribution of MTV and other brands.", "In Latin America, in general, we see great opportunity. We have a great focus on that. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are launching the Paramount brand in November throughout many territories in Latin America, which will give us more heft on the distribution side and advertising side. So this is an opportunity that we had not monetized very strongly to date. And we -- for ourselves, we have a lot of catching up to do, and we are devoting a lot of effort to doing so.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions, I guess. The first one is, if you could you can give us an update on the sort of TV production-side initiatives at Paramount, both from a, maybe, kind of projects in the works and when we might expect to see some -- the first kind of slate of shows and financial impact from that. And the second is kind of more big picture on the advertising side, forgetting maybe fiscal 3Q or 4Q. But you guys have been more forward thinking, at least from the outside, it looks like in terms of integrated digital, as well as traditional, linear advertising. And a lot of what you read in the press about the softness of the Upfront seem to suggest that some advertisers were moving money from traditional into digital advertising. Did you see any of that across your platforms as you sort of observed where money was being spent? And I guess, in a related sense, do you think that there's been a shift in the intermediate-term trajectory, kind of sustainable rate of cable advertising? [indiscernible] of growth?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "On the, David, on the TV production initiative, Paramount is making announcements as shows are gelling and getting distribution, so you will see a steady stream of announcements. The most recent one, of course, was the School of Rock with our very own Nickelodeon. The nice thing about our production activity in the current environment, which is a very good one for production activity, is we're able to build up this entirely new business with a very low overhead and a very low cost and, also, very little capital employed. So it will not have a major financial impact right away, but I think, as we continue to build it out over the next fiscal year, it will produce meaningful results to Paramount after that and it will be a steady build from there. So this is an exciting new business that will create strong long-term value for us. In terms of the big picture on the advertising side, in this Upfront, I think a major factor was really certain [indiscernible] -- particularly large advertisers who withheld dollars from the Upfront and every indication and it certainly seems to have been confirmed by remarks from some of our peers out there, every indication is that some of those dollars will come back in the scatter. And some of the other dollars may not come back, but it's more because of some difficult circumstances that an individual company or 2 are at in their general business where they're trying to save some dollars in the short term. At the same time, there are trends out there, which we are trying to and succeeding in participating in. There are a lot of dollars to capture by making use of data and putting our content out there on new platforms and getting monetization. And monetization is, of course, facilitated once you get measurement and that is improving. We're getting it on our own apps, because we have the data ourselves. Nielsen is rolling out a new measurement of mobile devices next quarter. That will help. So all the trend lines are such as to favor monetization on other platforms. And we are moving in that direction because our audiences are adopters of these other platforms. Our content is already being viewed by them. We're not getting the full monetization today because of some lag in the measurement and that will catch up over time.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "David, just to add to that, our -- Viacom's Echo product is a product where we joint venture with a company called Mass Relevance to measure Viacom's earned media across the social spectrum. So as dollars do move to digital, we're able to follow those dollars because a lot of the digital movement -- a lot of the activity in the digital space is consumption of our content and other big media companies' content. And we're now able to work with advertisers to measure that earned media, provide them with accurate statistics as to how their brand and their message travel across all those social platforms. And as Philippe said, the better we're able to measure that, the better we'll be able to -- and sooner we'll be able to, monetize that brand message being echoed across many platforms.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just jumping back to your commentary on the international business. I guess, what inning do you think you are in international expansion and your efforts to improve profitability there? I guess, any way you can give us some more color on the size of that opportunity?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "I think it's a huge opportunity. It's an opportunity that will not stop, so we are very early. I think the potential is -- so for many, many years of continued growth. I see double-digit annual growth in operating income from here on in, and I see our international business having the potential to become very big. This acquisition we're going to -- we expect to close this quarter of Channel 5, will build our business in a country that is very strong for us and where the economy is doing reasonably well, and it will be good for us in the U.K. But also, it's part of our ability to produce a lot more international content, which we will be able to distribute, not just in U.K, but around the world as we build existing brands and launch new brands. So this is a very, very big opportunity. In addition, on the distribution side internationally, there's some places where there are obstacles to traditional distribution, and we are benefiting and we see that growing from distribution on -- whether it's an SVOD platform, whether it's a distribution of certain content on mobile. So we just see a lot of opportunity across the board in many parts of the world.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up on your -- I think, your commentary earlier about seeing -- expecting low single-digit growth in domestic advertising in the September quarter despite very challenging comps. Is that just from your -- is that from your expectations of the scatter lifting, like you had mentioned? Or are you actually seeing, I guess, little bit of a pickup as you're entering that quarter?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, again, another way -- everybody's pretty much closed out their Upfront season. You're seeing the market normalize a little bit in the scatter market, the pricing is strengthening a bit in the scatter market and, yes, we'll see how it unfolds. We do have a -- last year's quarter is a very strong quarter for us, so we're lapping that. And we're still early in the quarter. We'll see how it plays out.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Securities.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. One, just back to the advertising potential from the distribution of your shows on multiple platforms. Can you talk about sort of the competitive environment there? You sound very bullish on the potential to see growth as the measurement improves. And I guess, my question is, do you feel that you are in a stronger position relative to your peers? Does the data that you have show that you can actually be share takers across platforms as that measurement improves? And then my second question is on the slate at MTV. I think Susanne Daniels has been with Viacom for about 1.5 years at this point. And I'm curious as you look at the slate of programs and the mix of sort of scripted versus non-scripted and the amount of new programming on MTV, do you feel like you've sort of achieved the mix that you want to be at? Or is this something that's still evolving? And anything that you can point to for how that mix would evolve from here would be helpful.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Okay, Michael. Yes, there's evidence that our content performs very well in new platforms. Just take VOD, our content really outperforms our peers' content on video-on-demand. Our viewers, who are young -- remember, we are very young-skewing -- if you look at demos, we are the leading family of networks when it comes to teens in 2 to 34s. We have 30%-type market share in cable in those categories, and those are heavy users of new technologies. Those are -- they look at VOD. They use devices. So to the extent that we can monetize that, we will disproportionately benefit as compared to producers of content geared toward older audiences. We also happen to have a greater mix of original programming compared to other programmers. And again, original programming is what will play the best in these new platforms. As far as the programming on MTV, Susanne has done a great job in developing compelling scripted shows, which really drive our audiences. We also have a good slate of reality programming on the boards. We're also looking at some individual animated possibilities. So this is a continuing building effort as part of our overall Viacom plan to increase the level of compelling original programming that will play well on all platforms. This is a big initiative of ours. At the same time, we're also looking at creating much shorter-form content directly using these new platforms -- non-television content. That's also a separate opportunity that we're devoting new resources within our company to participate in.", "Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If I could follow up on that, how -- what would be the plan for capitalizing on a different form of content? I mean, would that go on to linear networks or through your existing web properties? Or would you look to invest in different web properties to monetize that?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Michael, as you know, we're launching a lot of apps. We think that the apps should have not just the television content that we have, but it should have a lot of complementary content and social media connections. We have, on MTV, we have a very successful budding effort to provide topical information of what's happening in the culture on our websites and our apps. And more broadly, we see mobile operators, the big ones like AT&T and Verizon and others, really looking as we go into the future to enhance their mobile and make case for small devices, mobile video content. And so we think there will be new opportunities on both distribution and advertising side to monetize \"made for those platform\" short-form content, and we're already working on that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Just following up on your comments on the strength of viewing on other platforms. I was wondering if you can give us any updated thoughts on how you think the inclusion of mobile-device-viewing data will impact reported viewership or ad revenues on Nick and kids' channels in the year ahead. And secondly, I was curious about your thoughts about selling traditional TV inventory programmatically? Or otherwise, driving more data automation into the process of buying and selling.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, as far -- if I understood your question on Nickelodeon, the opportunity to monetize content appearing in apps, we've launched the Nick apps very successfully. We are able to add some advertising elements there. We're looking at other -- for some of our other Nick brands and other opportunities we might have to really mine additional advertising revenues, either directly on those or in connection with our television offerings. So that is showing an opportunity for Nick. As far as programmatic advertising for -- in terms of the television product, we don't see much appeal for that right now. It is useful for certain digital product, what I'd call more commoditized inventory. And what we offer, we provide a unique offering, for which we get high CPMs, of premium inventory, integrated marketing opportunities, as Tom referred to, marrying that with social media. None of that is captured in programmatic buying, which really does not provide the value to advertisers that we're able to provide with our premium video content.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "I guess, on the mobile question, I guess, partially I was wondering about the consequences of OCR, in particular, and just given the issues around measuring younger audiences. But on the programmatic issue, I guess, I was also thinking more on the -- your longer-tail inventory. If there -- if you see any opportunity for the Saturday, 10:00 a.m. on your lowest rated network, for example, if you see any opportunity? Or if again, it just doesn't make sense in the context of how you sell?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Brian, as you know, we still run a schedule across many of our networks, with some exceptions, some notable exceptions. For the most part that inventory, therefore, is not subject or applicable to the programmatic world. Where we do have some -- what I would label as remnant inventory, very little of it, and the amounts we have there, we do participate in the programmatic marketplace. But I don't think it's a significant factor in our business, as we continue to emphasize, as Philippe said, how to work with advertisers to come up with integrated marketing solutions to turbocharge their brand region consumer focus.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.", "Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I have 2. The first, Tom, you said affiliate revenue in September is going to be up double digits. Is that low double-digits? Teens? Any range you could give would be great. And then, Philippe, you talked about the Upfront. The volume was up to low- to mid-single digits. What about CPM increases for your portfolio?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "So as far -- I'll take -- on the affiliate side. Yes, as we indicated, we expect the full year to be high-single digit to low-double digit. So I think you can -- knowing the results of our first 9 months, you can figure out the range we expect for affiliate revenue in this quarter. So in short, it will be not low-double digits. As far as the Upfront CPM...", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Upfront CPM, we're -- very adeptly managed by our ad sales force. The folks that gave us significant volume increases, paid CPM increases in the low to mid-single-digit range. The people that did not give us significant volume increases paid in the high single-digit range.", "Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Philippe, can I just ask you one more question on what's driving the variability in the September quarter for affiliates used?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, again, within our affiliate revenue base, if you look at it on an annualized basis, and as Tom mentioned in his remarks, we have quarterly fluctuation that is really caused by product availability under deals with companies like Amazon, like Hulu, like some of the others that we deal with. And their -- we have the revenue recognition ties into product availability. So you get some variations when you look at last year's third -- third fiscal quarter, we had a big Amazon Prime deal that hit, which resulted in the flat affiliate fees we had in that quarter. This quarter, we have some different dynamics, where we have a combination of our continued steady, very strong traditional affiliate revenues, supplemented by, in this case, some better comps on the revenue recognition relating to product availability, and it's as simple as that. So on a full year basis, it all washes out, and when you get back to our consistent guidance year after year of high single-digit to low double-digit growth in affiliate revenues.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "So given how the advertising revenue growth is panning out this year, I was wondering at what point investors should worry that the Viacom story, which is modest sub2 [ph] rating and earnings growth and a lot of buyback, is in danger? Is low double -- low single-digit advertising revenue growth in the U.S. enough for you to keep doing what you are doing, and what drove the stock price up?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Well, Vasily, we have a lot of confidence in our growth opportunities as we go forward. We've been able to invest in growth. We have many opportunities for growth as we go forward. We think there are advertising opportunities that, in addition to the traditional ones, as we've been talking a lot about during this call, that relate to all these new platforms. We have the ability, thanks to the strength of our brands, our #1 position in all the important demos in our peers set, we're able to drive affiliate revenues at a consistent high single-digit to low double-digit rate. We are growing our international business very significantly. We are growing new revenues, whether it's television production, or animation efforts, consumer products, as we create content that is susceptible to ancillary revenues, including consumer products. So we see a lot of opportunity. We are disciplined in maintaining cost -- our cost structure, evolving our cost structure, while investing for the future, generating cash flow and really being focused on organic growth. Very targeted occasional acquisitions in the international arena, which will -- which we are very disciplined looking at as being accretive, and we believe we create a lot of value for our shareholders by returning capital to them. And that formula we've been consistently pursuing now for close to 8 years, Tom and I, and we will continue to do so.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so it sounds like the buyback is not in danger.", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Not at all.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant from ISI Group.", "David Carl Joyce - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's David Joyce. Question on dynamic ad insertion again, if I could. I think you've got a -- the trial out there now with Time Warner Cable. I don't know what you can talk about there. I was just wondering how widely -- when that would be widely distributed? When do you think it moves the needle? Does it seem like it's more of a product beyond the C plus 7? Or is it more for closer in-viewing for on-demand? And is it more from incremental advertisers or your current advertising base, such as those that you were selling to in the Upfronts?", "Thomas E. Dooley", "David, the dynamic insertion is a great new opportunity for us. The Time Warner experiment has been a terrific one. However, the volumes have been very small. The demand on the advertising side with this kind of product is great. And the sooner we escalate it, I think the more advertisers that will participate with us, because it allows a lot of data to come into play and a lot more targeting capabilities associated with that advertiser, which draws very, very nice EPMs relative to a regularly distributed commercial insertion. We are working with the other distribution partners and anticipate dynamic ad insertion agreements pretty much on a national level over the next couple of quarters. And when that happens, then we'll be able to produce this kind of inventory upscale somewhere into the second half of 2015. And I think it will benefit significantly, our ability to grow advertising and be much more precise in terms of the delivery of audience. We're working with a lot of partners who are just trying to figure out how to define that audience delivery. There's a lot of revolution on the advertising side to define who that specific audience target is. But as we get better at that and they get better at that, I think this will be a very fast-growing piece of the equation. As far as when we're going to start dynamic ad insertion, we've been doing it after the third day in 4-plus, and that has been very successful for us. And we haven't moved to the C7 currency, as you've heard out there, and dynamic ad insertion is more of an emphasis for us than C7.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Barton Crockett from FBR Capital Markets.", "Barton E. Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I thought I'd ask a question about consolidation since it really hasn't come up yet on this call. The waves of interest in consolidation have kind of, obviously, crested and fallen here. But you guys have some experience here, at least on the other side. You used to be one with CBS. And I was just wondering -- obviously, it was a different world back then. But did you feel, when you were part of one company with a lot of networks that you would would've had more leverage than you do today? And do you see any viable argument that makes sense for a company like Viacom to merge to get bigger in the U.S. to combat the consolidation of cable?", "Philippe P. Dauman", "Barton, we are focused on creating shareholder value and fortunately, because of the consolidation that we participated in much earlier than this era, we have built up a portfolio of networks that is #1. We have the strategic scale today. We don't have to buy it to be there. So we're #1 in 2 plus, so age 2 to 102, we have the #1 market share in our network family for all viewers; it's over 17%. If you take 2 to 49, we have over 23% market share, #1; 2 to 34, 27.5%, this is all according to Nielsen, #1; teens, we're #1. I could go on, but we have the leading positions in all that, and that's why we are able to do well as we drive affiliate revenues. We provide good value at the same time. We are still a low-priced family of networks. We provide a lot of functionality. Our audiences are using our distributors' VOD platform very heavily. They are using a different device and services that our distributors are offering their own customers. So we are in good shape. We're focusing on creating value in all issues. That's our singular focus, how can we create more value in Viacom, and we've done well in that regard, and by the way, since the split from CBS. So, yes, we were together. We've both done well on our own as we've gone forward, and as we've talked throughout about this call, Viacom has a lot of opportunities to grow as we go forward. And it's strategically well positioned to do so.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

Tom and Wade we'll go into greater detail on the results in a moment.", "In the fourth quarter revenues increased 9% to $3.99 billion, adjusted operating income was $1.21 billion effectively unchanged from a year ago and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were down 1% to $729 million.

In the current quarter, we plan to purchase $750 million in stock. For the 2015 fiscal year, we plan to purchase at least $2.5 billion of our stock.", "At our Media Networks, we invested well over $3 billion in content in the fiscal year. We remain committed to creating more original programming to grow our business and serve audiences who are consuming entertainment on more screens and in more ways than ever.", "With growth in domestic and international programming investment and the addition of Channel 5 in the UK, our overall content investment in fiscal 2015 will be in the neighborhood of $3.8 billion.", "Of course, the entire domestic television industry endured ratings challenges in the latter of fiscal 2014, due in part to the addition of the broadband only homes to the Nielsen sample, but also due to increased consumption on digital platforms that is not yet adequately measured.", "Our young audiences remain on the leading edge of this trend and we are working toward two broad strategic objectives, implementing an industry standard that appropriately reflects our valuable and rapidly growing multi-platform viewer ship and aggressively moving towards non- Nielsen dependent advertising monetization.", "Worldwide advertising revenue fell 2% in the September quarter, reflecting a 5% decrease in domestic advertising revenue in the quarter as a result of ratings declines. For the full fiscal year worldwide ad revenue was up 2% and domestic ad revenue was flat.", "As we continue to work with the industry to accelerate the evolution of measurement systems, we are also being aggressive in creating new ways to monetize within the current evolving framework. The opportunity is significant.", "A consumer products company's Director of Data Content and Media was recently quoted in AdAge as saying that more than three quarters of the digital impressions offered to advertisers to be rejected either because the impressions are fraudulent, unsafe, not viewable, don\u2019t meet brand requirements or are unknown. She is said \u201cThink about what this means for us as an industry when we are rejecting 75% to 85%of the impressions available, that\u2019s a problem\u201d.", "We at Viacom have the solutions to this problem, premium, safe, professionally produced video content in a reliable branded environment, animated by our unparallel marketing capabilities. Across all platforms beginning with television, our Viacom Velocity integrated marketing and branded content unit continues to expand its capabilities, grow its client roster, and earn a greater share of marketing budgets.", "Its pioneering work to measure, analyze and monetize our huge social media rich through Viacom Echo has been a big hit with advertisers. We're capitalizing on our robust data program, going beyond just selling against demos. Today, we help our advertisers target highly specific market segments across our brands and platforms, driven by unparallel research and data. We are increasing the amount of digital advertising inventory in our dotcoms, our apps and new mobile products we will be launching in 2015.", "Dynamic ad insertion is a rapidly growing opportunity for us. As we completed agreements with more MVPDs, most recently Verizon and better monetized our substantial share of the cable, video-on-demand market.", "In fiscal 2014, 30% of our domestic ad sales were non-Nielsen dependent. As we increased first party data driven advertising on our digital and mobile platform, sponsorships and Viacom Velocity integrated marketing solutions, dynamic ad insertion and other high value advertising opportunities, our objective over the next three years is to drive an increase in the percentage of non- Nielsen dependent domestic ad sales to 50%.", "At the same time, we hope and expect that the Nielsen measurement related to the other 50% will significantly improve in its reliability and capacity to capture so called TV everywhere viewing. These initiatives will result in more predictable advertising growth for Viacom in the years to come.", "On the distributions side, the landscape continues to evolve and we are benefiting from this change. Some of our strongest distribution partners were barely on the radar five years ago, and we expect new players to emerge in the next five years as well.", "Just as we were the first to partner with Satellite Services, Telco Distributors, and SVOD services and most recently Sony's forthcoming PlayStation Vue TV service, we will continue to maintain our strength on existing platforms and be early adopters of new platforms, mirroring the behavior of our audiences and capturing great value for our brands.", "In addition to the new deal with Sony, we recently renewed our agreements with Hulu and Amazon. As part of our Verizon renewal, we will provide content for a new Verizon Wireless mobile product. And we are looking forward to the expansion of Google Fiber into new markets, including Austin in December, and the opportunity it will give audiences to access our programming in yet another new way.", "In the past 12 months, we have concluded favorable multi year renewals covering about 25% of our total domestic subscribers, including Time Warner Cable, Verizon, more than 800 NCTC member distributors totaling more than 4.8 million subscribers and most recently Frontier Communications which has approximately 260,000 subscribers.", "We now have 70% of our subscribers covered by affiliate agreements that won't expire for at least three years and go out for as long as eight years. These renewals were completed on terms that can confirm our long-term guidance for high single to low double-digit growth in year-over-year affiliate revenue.", "Meanwhile, two small distributors that elected not to renew their carriage agreements with us are continuing to lose video subscribers since that decision. And this shrinkage is likely to continue. In contrast, we are continuing to welcome back their former subscribers who have switched to other providers in order to enjoy our popular family of brands, which include an industry leading seven out of the top 30 and eleven of the top 50 ad supported cable networks in people two plus and an industry leading eight out of the top 30 at a 11 of the top 50 in people 18 to 49.", "In the September quarter, worldwide affiliate revenue was up 22% and domestic affiliate revenue was up 21%. For the full fiscal 2014 both worldwide and domestic affiliate revenue increased 10%. Looking ahead, we are fueling our brands in all platforms with strong sustained investment in content.", "MTVs fans are among the most voracious consumers of content and the brand is formidable with youth. It was once again the number one global used media brand in 2014 according to Interbrand, and it dominates social media with more than 200 million followers.", "But MTVs audience has also rapidly embraced non-linear viewing and the brand is aggressively reinventing its user experience to match, going beyond television and reasserting its standing as the cultural home at millennial generation on every screen.", "MTVs Always On initiative has enhanced its role as a cultural catalyst and its powerful connectivity to social media and digital platforms. Worldwide traffic to MTV digital has jumped 84% since the launch of Always On in April and MTV is more deeply building Always On into the on air viewing experience with even more original short form content and real time programming stunts. MTV is at its best and it looks nothing like any other network on television and this is increasingly true with Always On.", "As it connects with its audience in new ways, MTVs bring more programs to air testing a wide net across scripted and reality to build a robust rounded programming lineup. In the current quarter MTV returns several hit scripted series, including Awkward, and Faking It. Looking into next quarter MTV will debut Eye Candy, its first ever scripted crime drama, starring Victoria Justice, a homegrown talent at Viacom.", "On the reality front, the current quarter will see new, reinvented versions of Catfish and The Real World the latter of which was rejuvenated last season thanks to a radical format shift. We'll also bring back Ridiculousness, which continues to be a stalwart high margin series for the network.", "Later in 2015, MTV will widen its creative aperture even further with the scripted fantasy series Shannara, which starts production in February in New Zealand. The newly green-lit series Scream, based on the popular film franchise will also make its debut next year.", "Comedy Central is also reinventing its brand experience to meet changing consumer behavior. The network had its biggest year ever in overall video delivery. Its more than 1.8 billion video views across non linear platforms in fiscal 2014. On the Comedy Central App, users are spending an average of 22 minutes per visit.", "Comedy Central is driving its cross platform consumption with the biggest original content push in its history from Key and Peele which is currently in its fourth hit season to the forthcoming The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore from John Stewart's Busboy Productions which will surely extend the network's run of success in late night.", "Nickelodeon is also launching more new programming than ever before. The network has launched six new series since August and will launch five more through the end of the March quarter. One of these series 100 Things To Do Before High School, premiered as a TV movie earlier this week and ranked number one in its time period across all television with key kid and tween demos. Nickelodeon's increased volume is feeding linear television and also the networks expensive digital presence and strong consumer products business.", "Following the tremendous success of the Emmy Award Winning Nick App, which already has 11 million downloads globally, Nickelodeon will soon launch a Nick Jr App which will be populated by Nick Jr power house content and characters and also include authentic on demand episodes and live streaming of the Nick Jr channel. We're certain that our pre-school content will thrive in the app environment.", "In consumer products, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remains the number one boy\u2019s action property. In fact, the toy line captured 29% of the boy\u2019s action market in August following the successful release of the Paramount film. Nickelodeon is currently the number one rating network with kids 2 to 11 and has a branded ecosystem that is delivering more original content across platforms, powering great consumer products.", "VH1 launched two new hits in the September quarter, Dating Naked and Candidly Nicole, both of which connected with audiences and will return for the second season. In the current quarter, the network extended its VH1 original movie franchise with Drumline, A New Beat, which drew in 2.4 million of viewers in its premier making it a number one non-sports telecast on cable for the night.", "And in early 2015, VH1 will debut Hindsight, a new scripted series with broad appeal. VH1 continues to strengthen the competitive foothold it has in scripted programming over competitors like E and Bravo.", "SPIKE is also bolstering its offering for renewal programming. The current quarter is the first in which the network has five nights of original programming and it continues develop exciting deeply engaging non-scripted series with great talent. Bar Rescue and Ink Master continue to anchor the network and perform well.", "Early next we'll see the debut of Coaching Bad, hosted Ray Lewis, and Framework, hosted by actor and musician Common. These series gives SPIKE a great platform to venture into scripted programming next year with the ambitious event series Tut, starring Sir Ben Kingsley and several other exciting projects in development with production partners, including Pierce Brosnan and Gary Oldman.", "We also launched the SPIKE App in September, and announced recently that SPIKE is going international launching in the UK in 2015.

We significantly broadened our presence in Africa in the September quarter both gaining increased distribution for MTV and launching Nick Jr, Nicktoons, and BET International in South Africa. Viacom now delivers more television channels than any other international programmer on the continent and we are well positioned to capitalize on the progress of the African market.", "More recently, we expanded distribution for Comedy Central Asia in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Pacific Islands and this week we'll launch the Paramount channel in Latin America. And in India, the worlds second largest country with a population growing at rate 50% higher than the US, our Viacom 18 joint venture, including our leading broadcast network Colors continues to add new networks and to thrive and grow.

Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 8%, while distribution and other expenses increased 42% year-over-year. SG&A expenses increased 9%.

The SG&A expense was driven by higher advertising and promotion expenses related to original programming, as well expenses related to new international channels and Channel5.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income was up 5%, while the adjusted operating income margin was 41%. The increase in adjusted operating income reflects higher affiliate revenues. The margin decline was driven by the 11% growth in expenses, partially offset by top line growth of 8%.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment. Revenues were up 12% in the quarter, due to an increase in theatrical revenues. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.

The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.4%, reflecting a 150 basis-point improvement as compared to the prior year.

Dooley", "", "Thanks, Wade. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on our full year results, as well as talk about our cash flow, our debt profile, and return of capital to our shareholders.

As we restarted our buyback program four years ago, we have repurchased a total of 229 million of shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $13.8 billion or at an average cost of $60 per share.", "Now moving on to our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. In terms of our short-term funding, to the extent we had incremental borrowings, we are funding this in the commercial paper marketplace at an annual rate of approximately 25 basis points. The quarter end we had no variable rate borrowings.", "In terms of our leverage, we ended the year with $12.8 billion of debt and capital leases outstanding. We had $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which reflects the payment for Channel 5 in September using offshore cash. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was slightly under 3 times. At September 30, our $2.5 billion bank revolver was undrawn.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2015. In terms of advertising, for the full year the addition of channels for [inaudible] will increase worldwide Media Networks ad sales by approximately 10%. In terms of our affiliate revenue, we continued to see long-term annual growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range.", "However, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For the December quarter, we anticipate that affiliate revenues will grow high single digits as compared to the prior year.", "For the full year, we expect that organic growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the high-single digits. However, the reported programming expense will grow in this high teens factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5. In terms of non-programming expense, we will continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization in order to preserve and enhance our margins.", "At Filmed Entertainment, we are excited about the upcoming slate, which includes SpongeBob and Monster Trucks, the first three leases from our animation label. We expect growth and profits to be weighted to the back half of the fiscal year as the studio benefits from their summer theatrical releases, as well as the availability of title ATV and Home Entertainment marketplaces.", "For 2015 we are forecasting a book tax rate of 33%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix. As for our stock buyback program, we expect to repurchase at lest $2.5 billion for fiscal 2015.", "Looking ahead at Paramount's production and development pipeline, the studio is currently in production on Mission Impossible 5, Terminator Genesis, SpongeBob and a recently started production on Daddy's Home, which stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. They will soon begin production on Ben Hur, which is co-production with MGM and the studio is in development on sequels to Star Trek, G.I. Joe, World War Z, Zoolander, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.", "In terms of TV production, Paramount has made great progress in a short period of time having already sold six projects through a combination of broadcast cable and Pay TV Networks. They currently have an additional six projects in development.", "Wrapping up, our industry is evolving and consumers have more choices in ways to consume video content than ever before. As the industry continues to evolve, we are moving quicker to develop ways to monetize viewer ship where measurement is currently unavailable or does not adequately capture consumption.", "Specialized products within our ad sales offering, like Viacom Velocity and Viacom Echo, as well as partnering with distributors to deliver targeted ads using dynamic ad insertion and first party data are some of the ways we are doing this.", "In addition, new services and models for distribution are developing in the over the top end mobile areas that looked to leverage premium video content. We will adapt our existing content and create new content for these services. With these developments we see increasing ways to reach our audiences and new revenue streams which will enhance our long-term growth in subscription revenues.", "In addition to these strategic initiatives, a core part of our philosophy has been to return excess capital to our shareholders. If you look at our buyback and dividend programs, as a percentage of market cap we continue to lead the industry in terms of capital returns.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll go to Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "I have two for Philippe on distribution questions. So Philippe, given the dropping by Southern Link [ph] and Cable 1, and the fact that you've also signed new affiliate deals, some people are still worried that the actions of those two small providers are harbingers of things to come when you face off with some bigger distributors in the years ahead.", "So how you respond to the fact that to drop you put three assigned and why is that \u2013 why are the dropping of sign of things to come?", "", "Philippe P. Dauman", "", "Thank you, Michael. The situations were isolated situations, such as, we by the way have renewed over the course last 12 months well over 800 distributors, not three or four, over 800 and most recently we announced yesterday the renewal Frontier Communications as I mentioned which has about 260,000 subscribers.", "We have renewed virtually all of the small distributors other than those two, and we are quite confident that as we have renewals over the next many years with distributors who want to maintain and grow their business, they will continue their relationships with us, enhance relationship with us as the leading purveyor of networks in the television industry.", "So we are very confident, we have renewed all the important renewals consistently over many, many years. We have delivered consistently on our long-term guidance of high single digit to low double-digit affiliate revenue growth. We will continue to do so for many years to come.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Philippe. Second question is philosophically there is also been controversies about these mini bundles, like where Dish is rolling out. Given that you have a wide suite of channels as you said, seven of top, large amount of top 30 channels. How do you think philosophically you're networks will respond or deal with some of these small bundle ideas that you see being proposed at this point?", "Philippe Dauman", "Look, we engage with all distributors existing new and future as demonstrated by our early commitment to Sony platform, as well as Google Fiber and others out there. We're not up to renewal in the near term with Dish and when we get there in the future we'll I am sure will have a discussion, and we'll see where it all comes up.", "Wade Davis", "", "In terms of mini bundles Michael, also our channels aggregate the highest concentration of ratings deliveries. So many of them are targeted giving consumers the most popular programs and channels, and our channels do that day in day out and have led the industry for use.", "Philippe Dauman", "Just to reiterate, we have aired top 30 channels, 11 are top 50 channels and 18 to 49 and I can go through every demo there is end demos where we are really core services at any one who wants to reach consumers and grow their business over the long-term as opposed looking at short term considerations.", "And everyone wants our channels and that\u2019s why we are the first stop for any new distributor out there and the first stop for existing distributors who want to launch new services and we will help all of our partners grow their businesses over the long-term as we grow.", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to John Janedis with Jefferies.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Hi, thank you. Philippe, as you know and the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty and the ratings are creating a lot of it in terms of how the impact part to your business like, fewer negotiations, advertising demand and maybe relevant to distributors. And so I was hoping you can help us understand the impact across the Viacom platform and maybe why those ratings concerns our being over played?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, again, when you talk about \u2013 I've just addressed the affiliate situation with Michael, but when you look at the ratings, we're talking about currently measured ratings, as discussed in our remarks, we have a lot of viewing on other platforms. There is lot of viewing to come as we launch new apps, as we launch new mobile products, as our distributors launch more services available on other devices in a more effective and efficient way.", "As those \u2013 as that viewing which continues to increase and all the fonts [ph] of viewing for our brands are growing each of them at double-digit rates, as that gets measured and monetized increasingly, we will have more reliable advertising growth.", "We are in a transitional moment where the existing measurement services have not caught up to the marketplace. They are trying to catch up, I am sure they will eventually catch up. In the mean time, we are not waiting for that.", "We are moving forward and as I mentioned in my remarks, we are going to aggressively by rolling out more video in more places to more people and using first party data and other marketing capabilities, we are going increase significantly, the amount of our advertising sales are non- Nielsen dependent and in the mean time Nielsen and others will catch up.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Thanks. And then maybe on a separate topic then, you know, there is been move as you know from some of the premium cable networks to look at the optionality around going direct to consumer, from Epix perspective, is there any interest of either increasing your stake and you're going direct?", "Philippe Dauman", "Our Epix is in growth mode on distribution. We just recently launched it very successfully with Time Warner Cable and AT&T, the rate of adoption is better than projected in these early stages. So we are really focusing on expanding the distribution.", "Was close watch with HBO and others might do, but right now we are focusing and growing distribution. We are doing very successfully; we're growing the operating income of Epix at a nice clip going forward. We're getting it to original series production which will appear on Epix again next year, creating new opportunities. And as time goes forward, we'll look at the pay television marketplace and decide to what to do.", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "All right. Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Welcome.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Vasily Karasyov with Sterne Agee.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Thank you. Good morning. Philippe about rating, my question is about ratings, I think in the past two, three years ago when Nickelodeon had a step down in ratings, you guys were willing to quantify what your thought was the impact of the Nielsen sample and different kinds of Nielsen measurement impact on that, partially through set top box data and some data from our distributors. I do know some of you distributors publicly did say that that data does not support the Nielsen ratings trajectory. Then I have a quick one on margins?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, look, as far, where we're focused on at Nickelodeon is to continue to rollout new series. We've got \u2013 we're going to be rolling out three new live action series that this week we launched TV movie so one of them very successfully, 100 Things To Do Before High School and there are couple of others we're excited about.", "So, we're just going to put our new programming, which by the way gets monetized in many, many ways besides advertising driven by the Nielsen ratings and we will continue to maintain our leading position in two to eleven. We will see improvement as we go forward and we're very confident that Nickelodeon continue last year in the US and above its going very nicely all over the world and is a real growth business for us for the very long time.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Thank you. And on the margin front, on the networks, I think before the Channel5 acquisition the rule of thumb was that one could kind of done like 30 to 50 basis points margin expansion every fiscal year. So and this time fiscal time 2015 is a transition year once we left Channel 5, but can you give us a feeling as to what the margin trajectory will look like 2016 and beyond, can we still count on expansion? Thank you.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "", "Yes, we still believe that we will be able to get the margins that continue to grow in the range decided and we believe in that because we continue to have opportunities to operate the core businesses as more efficiently driven principally by technology and the application of that to both our programming to capture and our programming distribution.", "Vasily Karasyov - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "All right. Thank you, Tom.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, thanks. I need to ask about something so mundane, but I am going to ask about you know, Philippe, can you talk a little bit about the sort of current ad environment and what you're seeing sequentially off of the fiscal fourth quarter as we go into the first quarter, do you think the market sort of picked up and what does it mean for your ad revenues.", "And then second, on the capital returns, last year at this time you guided to buybacks, I think about at least $3 billion and was up sort of over delivering a $3.4 billion this year, you know, at least $2.5 billion. Has anything changed in terms of capital allocation and target leverage? Thanks very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you for your question. So David, the ad environment we're seeing this quarter a pick up in demand in the marketplace, our issue is not being demand for what we have, our issue at the end of the last year and at the beginning of this quarter, has been the Nielsen ratings on that portion of our ad revenue and that\u2019s been our challenge.", "The demand is good out there, the scatter pricing that we are seeing is up in the high single digits compared to the upfront. But it\u2019s hard to obviously to prognosticate the full quarter, but based on the first half of the quarter where the ratings are which is our current and which was temporary issue, we expect our \u2013 the ratings domestically to be \u2013 the ad revenues rather domestically to be comparable to the Q4 of 2014. And we would expect to see improvement from there as the year progresses.", "As far as the buyback, yes, we expect purchase at least $2.5 billion, we're going to buy $750 million in this quarter and then as the quarters roll forward we'll see how much more we can consider on buying a lot of factors out there I believe our cash flow, our investments, taxes and so forth. And as you correctly point out, historically we've ended up buying more than we projected at the beginning of the year, yes, that may or may not be the case this year, but we\u2026", "Thomas E. Dooley", "", "There is still range in our capital return philosophy, our leverage ratio remains the target that we've established and we will continue to pay or excess cash flows within that leverage ratio constraint back to shareholders.", "David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Thank you. I've a question on the measurement comment that you made, I guess given the short come into measurements and your comments on some of the new initiatives, I guess underway, can you give us a sense I guess to timeline or what data points we look to as evidence of progress there and when we could see maybe a more material impact on advertising?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, Alexia, as far as timeline, there is one final weekend control and that\u2019s the non- Nielsen measure part of our ad domestic advertising business and as I said in 2014 it\u2019s about 30% of that business, that is a growth part of our advertising business for us.", "Our target over the next three year periods to give you the guidance is to have that cost you about 50% of our domestic ad sales and we have unique products and none of our competitors have to help us accomplish that. Viacom Velocity, Viacom Echo and capabilities directed at audiences that none of our competitors today have.", "And the hilarious mobile and everything we're doing will drive that dynamic and seasonal drive that. As far as the other part of our business, yes, we always remain hopeful that measurement of viewing on game devices for example which are increasing part of what is not measured by nelson, on also some other devices that are being, that are seeing distribution of video content through our various distributors, we hope that will start showing up as we get into 2015 and beyond.", "There will be some kicks along the way, it takes a while for the incumbent measurers to catch up with the market place and that probably can't control but we do expect it will get better and that will be a big benefit to us and as I've said before we will disproportionately benefit from it, given that our audiences are consuming a lot of content in those un measured places.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "Well, excuse me, the milestones to look towards are the \u2013 we increased distribution of our apps, our apps distributed more aggressively. It makes our product available, of course, multiple devices which makes it more convenient for consumers to consume that programming as we reach or extend our agreements with cable operators and they deploy TV everywhere.", "That is a real catalyst to driving significant growth as our content becomes available in that format that provides us with opportunities to deliver specific ads to specific consumers. That is the \u2013 what the future of the business looks like in terms of the dynamic growth equation. Probably assume through apps and our websites and on the platforms that our distribution partners are putting in place.", "Philippe Dauman", "The way I look at it, we're just in it, we're transitioned, we're going through a transitional period over the front frame as a year to two, to three years, during which we really merge from that in a much stronger position and we are investing to that end, we are innovating to that end. And we look at this as a great opportunity for us, technology will be our friend in this arena.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just a quick follow up on the new relationship with Sony, any color you can give us in terms of how you get paid from that is it on a per stop basis or just some \u2013 component? Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we don\u2019t generally disclose terms of our third relationships, but as their distribution grows, you know, begins and grows, we will grow propornately. We are very pleased with the economic and on economic terms of our relationship with Sony and obviously much of our audience is using play station devices and we think we will acquire a lot of new viewers who may not currently have cable subscriptions and those may switch over and as was the case of past emerging distribution partners, like the Telco\u2019s, we'll see this is a great opportunity to expand distribution and grow revenues.", "Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Thanks for taking the question. You comment about ad demands suggest to me that advertisers are essentially taking the savings that you\u2019re getting if your ratings are off \u2013 I think they are getting the same delivery, it will take what Nielsen says and essentially pocketing it. Do you think \u2013 give a sense about what's happening or they looking for other places to spend the money?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, I mean, you're point out another area that relates to monetization where there is a lot of excess viewer ship of programs that are \u2013 that basically are not part of the currency that advertiser are paying for us, so to that extent is free viewer ship, that is again another opportunity as Tom referenced, where you have the ability to target advertising on a more one to one basis you can actually monetize all that viewer ship that is not currently being monetized through the way advertising is being sold right now. So again the currency of advertising transaction will evolve during this same timeframe that we'll see an evolution a rapid evolution of measurement techniques.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "But maybe relatively do you think Nielsen specifically or is it about building consensus with them and advertisers, maybe relatively, you'll be characterized how long your contract with nelson runs?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, there lot of things we are doing at the same time and as we \u2013 I won't repeat them and improving measurement, engaging in self help if you will with a non- Nielsen measurement part and we are also in communication with our advertisers, so we have a high concentration of nature branded advertisers who value very much of Viacom Velocity, Viacom Echo and other marketing opportunities we offer them.", "So we are working with them to deliver a better marketing impressions on their customers and as part of that we have an opportunity with them with the advertising agencies to discuss how we should be compensated for the unique services we provide. And that will be an important driver for us as we transition through this period.", "Brian W. Wieser - Pivotal Research Group LLC", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "You're welcome, Brian.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG", "Hi. Couple of questions. First on Epix, if any one of the three partners merged with the competing pay TV channel, what is mechanics, meaning the numbers of years to reclaim, I think 50% of the movie output that\u2019s currently given Apex, just curios how that works.", "And then just, Philippe I think you mentioned that 70% of your distribution deals are at least 3 years from today before they expire. But I was just wondering just given all of the focus of the market right now has on distribution and the importance of your distribution revenue stream, could you give us some sense of the percentage of the subs that you have that are up during calendar \u2013 sorry during your fiscal 2015? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Yes, that\u2019s right, I think we have a great partnership with both Lionsgate and MGM, it has long-term output deals and obviously that\u2019s going to lay out the terms of those deals, but we contemplate different scenarios so to ensure that we have the pipeline of content that Epix need. And by the way our Epix in the movie arena has as good or better content then any other paid service out there and it is very reasonably priced for our distributors. So that accounts for the rapid growth we are seeing in Epix. We're very excited about that trajectory.", "As far as the 30% of the \u2013 or so of the subs that are for renewal over the next three years, its roughly equally distributed, you know, some variations over those three years. So there is nothing around that 10% or so a year over the next three years and then as I said over the following five years because the other 70% some start expiring over three years form now, and some go as far as eight years from now, they are spread out.", "We have followed a philosophy in our renewals of really having a spread out in a way where we do not have too much risk in any given year. And it also allows us to provide very predictable guidance in our affiliate revenues and of course what I am not referencing and talking about those subscribers are all the new subscribers, probably is new distributions services, which as they continue to grow, again we'll kick in during the same period additional revenues.", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG", "And if I could just follow up, as you made a comment the very beginning that you thought that your ratings issues were in part due to viewing on platforms that you weren\u2019t capturing ratings on, but you sold content to platforms like Amazon where obviously ratings don\u2019t matter because there is no advertising. I am just curious what percentage of the ratings dropped do you think is occurring from licensing to platforms where there is no advertising to capture?", "Philippe Dauman", "If you look at the number of minutes consumes on the existing SVOD platforms as compared to the minutes consumed on power vision this is an industry statistics, yes, we're still talking about some thing like 2% to 3% of all minutes viewed as on all of these services put together.", "So it\u2019s still small. We are \u2013 we of course monetize our library content it\u2019s a form of syndication for us that did not exist before largely on content no longer airing on our networks and in some cases more recent releases where we feel having \u2013 and content on some of the distributors like Hulu, in addition to the monetization we get directly from them has some promotional value to us. So very prejudious [PH] and how and what we licensed to the SVOD these services but we value them as customers and as a way for us to monetize the content and we increased.", "If you look at the content spend that we have, you can look at our having a very large proportion of the growth and programming spend go to new original content and that\u2019s good for our networks but also creates an increasingly library of original content which has value in SVOD deal or more traditional syndication avenues particularly when you get into scripted series and as I talked about for several of our networks, this thing is produced more and more scripted series, including some very high end series like Tut which are valuable in the aftermarket.", "Thomas E. Dooley", "", "Which consumers really love the functionality, the technological functionality that some of the S5 providers deliver the ability to binge view, the ability to you know, get search and recommendation. Our cable distribution partners and Telco distribution partners are now beginning to implement those kinds of technology and that functionality that is resulted in a very significant increase in the consumption of our content in particular some of our younger skewing content in terms of VOD off the cable library that they provide in store, we're beginning to be able to track that, we're beginning to be able to monetize against that with digital commercial insertion.", "So those are the real opportunities but we believe that that accelerates and that functionality becomes more broadly available across the ecosystem that will be a big driver of our growth into the future and something that consumers really like and really want to use.", "Philippe Dauman", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi", "", "Just had a quick question on that 30% of your ads today that are non- Nielsen based, would you be willing to give just sort of any rough parameters in terms of the mix, how much is apps versus web versus ad insertion and how do you think that mix will change as you glide towards your 50%?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, I prefer to look at it as a \u2013 as how we can grow that going forward, so we're going to grow that 30% through a combination app, so again new mobile products that were going to be some exciting innovative products we're going to be launching in 2015. Dynamic ad insertion will start becoming significant from what is now a very small base as we go forward.", "We are going to increase the amount of sponsorship revenue with a lot of our marketing partners. We are going to have a lot more integrated marketing opportunities for which we'll get paid directly.", "So all of those will take where we are today to over the next three years to a more balanced mix with Nielsen, and by the way going forward from there, we expect that growth to continue. And by then the Nielsen and others will pass this caught up where the world is today and then we'll see how \u2013 whether they can continue to steep up with how the marketplace evolves from that point.", "Jason Bazinet \u2013 Citi", "Very good.

I am honored to be the new Executive Chairman of Viacom and I will do my at most to continue to drive Viacom\u2019s operations forward and restore stock to its proper valuation.

Adjusted operating income was $839 million and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $470 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined 9% with $1.18 per diluted share.", "2015 was a challenging year for Viacom as it was for many in the industry. However, it was a watershed year in which we took many important steps to position Viacom for the future. We reorganized and refocused our organization increasing both our Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment production pipelines. We also stepped up our investment in data measurement and marketing expertise and fuels our growth in the most attractive overseas markets. And we did all of this while delivering record earnings per share in 2015 and the highest Media Networks revenue in our history.", "As we turn the corner into 2016, the hard work and investment is bearing fruit. Let me give you few of the highlights. We have dynamic new leadership in our business units and several of our major networks including MTV and VH1.", "Viacom\u2019s creative culture is stronger than ever. Our focus on original programming and rapid deployment is paying off. Existing hits such as Lip Sync Battle, Paw Patrol, Love & Hip Hop and exciting new programming like Game Shakers, Younger, Teaches and I love Kellie Pickler are continuing to attract valuable and devoted audiences.", "In fact Viacom had seven of the top 20 cable series in the quarter. Most major networks have seen year-over-year rains improvement and that raining strength is driving advertising improvement. There will be more to come as the changes underway with Comedy Central and MTV kick in and the ad market continues to strengthen.", "An enhance distribution ecosystem is coming together with strong upside for content providers. We are experimenting and reaping the benefits of increased consumer choice.", "Our international business is a strong performer with great upside but remains underappreciated. We are expanding distribution, creating differentiated and popular content building on Channel 5 substantial success, launching the high margin Paramount channel its ever more territories and building our success in India\u2019s high growth market.", "And Paramount is into its rebuilding process with the movie pipeline improving and TV operations off to a strong start.

As I said that\u2019s a one off item and that\u2019s a factor in there. So as we turn into next year, I think we\u2019ll get to a more normal growth rate in affiliate revenue.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay, and then Philippe, follow-up on the news of your appointment as Executive Chairman, we wonder if there will any change to strategies now that you\u2019ve combined CEO and Chairman, any change of strategies or leadership of the company or any asset mixes that may change with the change to you as Chairman?", "Philippe Dauman", "Look, yeah Sumner and I have been in harmony and how we pursue our strategy going forward, obviously as we all kwon, the world is changing, our specific industry is changing. We have taken a significant number of steps which I outlined in my remarks, I won\u2019t repeat it, to move into the future, to build the existing ecosystem, we finalize our brands grow internationally, grow on multiple platforms the Snapchat deal that we announced this morning is an indication. You will see more deals to come. As I said in my remarks, I will leave no stone unturned, I never have and I never will.", "And our objective is to build value. We are building value for the long term. We are building value with a few to getting our - a better valuation of our stock in the short term.

We will get by come back to the growth that we all want to stay.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to our next question, sir, from John Janedis of Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Thank you. Philippe, in the past you\u2019ve talked about the line of site to flat ad growth, I just wanted to ask, based on what you are seeing today, has your confidence level changed and have you see a change in the matter of tone in the marketplace given the recent macro headlines?", "Philippe Dauman", "We\u2019re seeing strong demand in the scatter market and strong pricing. We are seeing pricing in the scatter market over the last upfront in the neighborhood of 20%. So that builds very well for the upcoming upfront with builds particularly well for us as the great progress that we\u2019re making across most of our networks which I believe will turn into virtually all of our networks in short order. We are seeing a great appetite for our leading Viacom Vantage, Viacom Echo and Viacom Velocity products. We are determined to get back to ad growth. We\u2019ve also looked at having a healthy environment for our marketing partners. As you know, we have taken down our ad load in several key time periods across several of our networks and that to some extend might have suppressed some of the short term advertising growth but it is healthy for us and will lead to very healthy return to ad growth as we improve over the back half of the year and into next year.", "John Janedis", "You talked about this on your prepared remarks, I mean in the under measured platforms, where is the industry in capturing rating in this platforms and are you still on target for the non-Neilson based advertising at 50%?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well that will be a particular driver on getting shall we say supplemental or differentiated currency for us. We\u2019ll be as we go into the upfront, we have a lot of as I said before, we have a lot of advertiser clambering to get involved with these products and we\u2019ll be able to engage with them more deeply. As you know in this year, we had ramped up to an 11 major advertisers, I said in the last earnings call, we expect that number to triple thereby representing a large portion of our advertising revenues as we go into next year as a result of the upfront discussions we\u2019re having. We\u2019re able to offer reach into other platform like Snapchat which we announced this morning. And we\u2019re also seeing some moves by Neilson to improve its measurements. We are seeing some competition coming up with the comScore and track combination, so all of these together will move toward better capturing the actual reach that our networks have.", "John Janedis", "Thank you very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome John.", "Operator", "And now we\u2019ll go to our next question from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Hi thank you. Just my first question just following-up on your comments just now on the advertising market given the strength of the scatter you just stated in the fact that I believe you have more inventory available in the March quarter versus the December quarter I guess, any color of how we should think about sequential, further sequential improvement in domestic ad revenues in March?", "And then my follow-up question is just on any update on the buyback given upcoming maturities, how should we think about use of cash?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Alexia. Yeah as far as the ad market again we\u2019re looking at the general health of our networks. You\u2019re quite right, we\u2019re seeing improvement. We do have some work to do in our Comedy Central and MTV networks, MTV in particular will take a little more time because the new managements programming will be kicking in later and that\u2019s going to be significant. It\u2019s still early in the quarter, we expect this quarter to be in the vicinity of where we are going to see some meaningful progress in the back half of the year with our objective by the end of there to be poised for growth and sustainable which is what we are looking for sustainable growth in advertising revenues.", "As far as the buyback is concerned, you\u2019re right, now we\u2019re focused on strengthening our operations, we\u2019re paying down debt as Tom mentioned, we are not refinancing where we\u2019re paying off an upcoming maturity. We are committed to our investment grade rating. And in due course, as we have availability within that framework, we will move forward at the appropriate time in the future to utilize the capacity that we have in our buyback program.", "Wade Davis", "Like, just from that point of view, it\u2019s important to note that as we\u2019ve reduced unit loads at certain networks, the full benefit of the ratings up with that we\u2019ve realized gets offset by some of that unit load reduction. As soon as we get to a more comparable period, the benefit of the ratings increasing will start to flow through. And I think as we said, bring into positive ad sales growth.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Doug Mitchelson of UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks so much. I think one for Philippe, one for Tom. And Philippe, you mentioned a short term extension with this, so maybe short term hiccups and I wasn\u2019t sure to how to take that comment, so whether in Viacom or close or far part in perception of value of the networks, any further commentary there would be appreciated.", "And Tom, just sort of following-up on the comments of the balance sheet and maybe would Philippe would jump on this. But give sort of the back and forth with some of the debt ratings, the environment the debt markets right now and the trends for the business, you start to rethink you know what a good target leverage for the company should be, as we thought to figure out when the company can go back on often, so share purchases, do we use sort of the prior guidance for balance sheet goals or should we think about it more conservative in the future sort of given the events for the couple of years? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Doug, if you could appreciate, I want to address in remarks that this issues given that\u2019s been so much in the public domain and I wanted to bring all of your up to date where we are. But beyond that I don\u2019t want to go beyond that because what\u2019s important is for us to negotiate constructively and productively and price it until we get to a deal. And there is always give and take and the negotiations and so I wouldn\u2019t take anything more than that for what I said in my prepared remarks.", "Doug Mitchelson", "When we think about you know trying to figure out what our own affiliate revenue estimates should be, should we look at your updated guidance for affiliate revenue as including something you sort of different for this or if you know once the Dish deal happens then maybe it will be feel sort of a further update on affiliate revenue?", "Philippe Dauman", "We are comfortable with the update that we - that Tom mentioned.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Okay.", "Thomas Dooley", "Doug, on our leverage target you know look, we want to be solidly investment grade as a company. As you remember back in 2008, 2009, we delivered the balance sheet relatively quickly that\u2019s due to the company\u2019s very strong free cash flow generation capability. We think we can get down into the ranges that leverage some of the rating agencies are looking for companies like ours operate within. And we\u2019ve had a stated target of 2.75 to 3.0 and we\u2019re going to operate within that metric and perhaps at the lower end of that metric and then we\u2019ll look from there where the operations are and the opportunities to buy back shares at that point.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Alright, thank you both very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome Doug.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Richard Greenfield of BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ve got two. The first one for Philippe, I just wanted to follow-up on what you said at the end of your prepared remarks, you know given the exceedingly poor performance of Viacom over the past several years on an absolute basis and even looking relative to your peers and what appears to be some significant management turnover. Just wondering if you could give us color on why that you are the Board\u2019s choice to be both Chairman and CEO, like what was it trade wise that the Board looked in you and said that was why, that was the right decision for Viacom?", "And then two, looking at Comcast, they shifted several of your channels to a tier. You said I think publically that that was a violation of the contracts they had with Viacom, have you sued Comcast and is that a risk that other distributors could try to tier some of your channels? Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Rich, first of all as far as the performance of Viacom, let me just challenge what you indicated. Viacom\u2019s performance was at the top, in fact we have five consecutive years of begin significantly beating the S&P and our stock performance. Clearly we have from that a lot in the last two and especially last year. Some of the decline was extenuated in the recent pass by a lot of noise that existed around us. And I think some people who have been buying the stock in that period are have the fore site to see through a noise. And I think we have outlined the steps we are taking, the forward looking steps we are taking and the progress we are making in several aspects of our operations.", "And then I level it to the Board, I am gratify that the Board overwhelmingly supported me for the position. They know me, they know what our plans are strategic plans, they know what our operational plans, they endorse them, they have confidence and I will repay that confidence by producing the results without sharking our obligation to make the changes that are necessary to make Viacom the leading content company of the future. That is our objective.", "As far your question relying to Comcast, yes, they have violated our agreements and we are going to not sit back, we have not filed a lawsuit against Comcast but we will preserve our rights as we go forward.", "Richard Greenfield", "And Philippe, could I just follow-up. I really appreciate your answers for those questions. What was the noise that you specifically are point out that obscures the underlying results, what are the key noise elements that we should all be focused on?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, if you haven\u2019t been listening, you don\u2019t know what the noise is. I think it\u2019s obvious to everybody what the noise is.", "We\u2019ll go to our next question operator.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Vasily Karasyov with CLSA.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Thank you. Philippe, you were talking about MTV and Comedy Central returning back to growth and I understood that was advertising revenue growth. So I was wondering from the rating standpoint, do we just need for the comps to get easiest on when the May, June time period or do you expect recovery before that and what were the tag, do you have enough programming to do that?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Vasily. Look, we are - let me take them in two parts. As far as Comedy Central goes, clearly we have a great creative output there, that\u2019s resonating with our audiences. We have a number of returning series that are coming on stream to add to what\u2019s already there. So I think we have a healthy pipeline of Comedy Central and I think overtime that will take care of itself. And it\u2019s very attractive programming that reaches young audiences attractive to advertisers.", "As far as MTV goes, MTV is in more of a rebuilding mode. We have a new Head of MTV that started just a very few months ago, who has rehabbed his team, has as I mentioned in our remarks, Green let new series. We needed and need more programming on MTV. That will start kicking in overtime. We are accelerating the hearing of the shows that are already in production so that we can fill the schedule better. We are going to add new shows and that will just build on itself over the next several months and quarters. So it\u2019s a little bit of different exercise but I think the energy that\u2019s being applied to it, the new enthusiasm for it, the reaching out to more programming sources and more relevant programming sources is very encouraging and I feel very good about the future there.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Thanks so it sounds like Comedy Central is this fiscal year event and MTV probably just go \u201817?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, I expect to see some improvement in MTV before we get to fiscal \u201817, but we can see the full impact of the changes into fiscal \u201817.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "You\u2019re welcome Vasily.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Barton Crockett of FBR Capital Markets.", "Barton Crockett", "Okay, great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to, focusing on one of the assets you said was undervalued and that is the film studio. You know if you look at the independent kind of smaller film studios that are publically traded, kind of premium multiples I think impart based on people\u2019s view of the value for library and you get some good disclosures there from people like Lionsgate run by a former colleague of yours which takes about $500 million of library revenues, nearly $200 million of library EBITDA, could you guys give us a sense of the library revenues in cash flow at Paramount presumably it\u2019s bigger and could you give us any way to kind of get a handle on the value and the cash flows from that?", "Philippe Dauman", "We don\u2019t breakout that kind of information, we haven\u2019t in our history also we have a different level of materiality for Viacom that it is for a Lionsgate. I think it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of value there and as I\u2019ve indicated before, we\u2019ve also used a library to build assets in our case using our channel distribution capability. I mentioned epics in the U.S. And the Paramount channels are really adding scale a new demographic reach for us in many, many countries around the world and still growing as the race performance is really strong. And it is really helping to accelerate the growth on our international business which is a really underappreciated story as I mentioned.", "We are building very significant value there and you can even breakdown components of our international business notable India and see the important value creating that\u2019s taking place.", "So Paramount as other studios have at various stages has had a little slumping in output on current production, but I have confidence in the team there. I like what I see in terms of development. And that will improve the overall results and of course add to the impressive library that Paramount has as we mentioned.", "Barton Crockett", "Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.", "Operator", "And then we\u2019ll to our next question from Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research.", "Brian Wieser", "Thanks to taking the question. I actually wanted to dive in a bit into the Snapchat relationship. I was curious if you could providing more details around how you are thinking about using the relationship, we\u2019d be selling Snapchat independent sales of TV of relate inventory as well or is it meant to be a more of a value add sales and how long do you expect this relationship to continue with them?", "Philippe Dauman", "As we discussed a multiyear relationship, we believe we are great fit and they believe they are great fit for us. We will be flexible and how we use the inventory either selling it direct, whatever it generates better value for both partners in this relationship is what we will do.", "I don\u2019t want to tutor on horn but I think they saw in us by the most forward looking at sales organization out there, one with the kind of reach live events and other attributes of that marry well with what they are trying to do. And we look forward to being a very fruitful relationship for both of us.", "Wade Davis", "I just add to that Brian, it\u2019s a great deal for Snapchat, it\u2019s a great for Viacom but most importantly it\u2019s a great deal for the advertisers that we deal with because it provides them with a suite of products that will reach a very hard to reach audience and we\u2019re able to help Snapchat bundle together with our inventory to reach that audience and help advertisers reach that audience. I think it\u2019s a win, win, win for all three parties in the ecosystem.", "Brian Wieser", "Thank you very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And we will go to [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. So going back to Michael Nathanson\u2019s question earlier about through the affiliate sort of compensation, do you expect S5 in the fiscal year to be up, down, flat, maybe some magnitude you can give us?", "Philippe Dauman", "Now, I won\u2019t give guidance on that, but overall that S5 is a better growing part of our distribution ecosystem with of course radicchios and what we license, what the windows are in licensing. As you know we have content that moves around, has moved on historically among the various S5 providers, there are other that are immerging, we are talking to new potential entrance into the field and that\u2019s both domestically and internationally. So mange it all in a holistic way and we see that as one of the factors in driving our affiliate growth revenue going forward.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "Welcome. We want to thank everybody for joining us for the call.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Philippe Dauman, our Executive Chairman, President, and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements, and involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Philippe.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Viacom's results for 2016 second quarter. As we move forward, we have several notable areas of strength, including ratings improvement in key network, solid visibility on long-term affiliate revenue growth, increasing value generated from the growing use of technology and data, and continued growth in our international business. We made solid progress in the quarter, driving significant change across our brands to increase the value of our content and better position us for the future.", "There are four major strategic objectives driving change and future growth at Viacom. First and foremost, we continue to make substantial investments in content, specifically original content, long-term imperative that is generating clear results and building long-term value. This includes steadily escalating content investments in television and film, as well as short-form mobile content.", "Second, we are upgrading and expanding our already substantial data capabilities to deliver more accurate metrics for advertisers and greater monetization potential. We are out in the lead in this area and are beginning to reap the benefit which will accelerate as we go forward.", "Third, we are maximizing our opportunities for revenue growth with traditional distributors while moving forward with new forms of distribution. Our content ownership and the popularity of our content on new platforms and social media are providing new options as the ecosystem evolves.", "And fourth, we continue to look at strategic options to enhance our competitive position and unlock the value of our businesses. Our exploration of a strategic minority investor in Paramount is an excellent example, as is our continued international expansion.", "Looking at the numbers, in the second quarter, revenues declined 3% to $3 billion. Adjusted operating income was $586 million, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations were $303 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to $0.76 per diluted share.", "Turning to Media Networks, revenues declined 3% to $2.38 billion in the quarter. Ad sales revenues were down 5% in the U.S. While it is early in the quarter, we hope to improve the rate of change in ad sales revenue, even as we reduce unit load at several of our networks, which bodes well for brand health and future financial performance. This year, we expect a strong upfront, a tripling of Viacom Vantage client, and additional interest in kids, where Viacom has some of its greatest strength. The movie studios are coming to this upfront with an increased number of kids and family oriented theatrical releases, and as a dominant kids' network, this is very positive for Nickelodeon. In addition, we have recently launched Viacom Vantage Studio Edition, the first data driven ad product specifically for the studio category, where we see significant opportunities for overall growth.", "Domestic affiliate revenues in the current quarter decreased 2%, impacted as we had previously discussed by the rate realignment with a major distributor and slight declines in distribution in line with industry trend. SVOD revenues are expected to be more significant in the second half of our fiscal year. Based on the long-term deals we've recently closed, we expect to grow affiliate revenues with traditional distributors and overall, at mid-single-digit rates in 2017 \u2013 when the rate realignment will be behind us \u2013 and beyond.", "Our recent renewal with DISH on favorable terms was an important moment for Viacom. In the past year, we have successfully renewed distribution deals with several major distributors representing over 44 million subscribers. We now have long term deals in place with all of the major distributors and an extended runway for steady affiliate revenue growth.", "We have a real opportunity to build on that momentum. Our networks are highly valued by our cable, satellite and Telco partners because they drive substantial live and video-on-demand viewership. In fact, the reach of our networks is vastly underappreciated. We continue to own the largest share of viewership in multiple key demographics on a highly monetizable cable television platform. Viacom networks combined represents the largest share of cable viewing of any cable family for all viewers 2+ according to Nielsen. And we gained more share compared to a year ago than any other family of cable networks among viewers 2 to 49, where we have 21% of viewership. We also have the largest share of viewers 18 to 34, also 21%, and 18 to 49 at over 17%. The significance of this share shift will become even more evident as new more robust measurement tools take hold in the market.", "In addition, our networks and the demos they attract are much desired for OTT streaming services from new entrants in the industry, as well as those developed by the traditional distributors such as Sling. While cable penetration continues to decline across the industry, the penetration of connected devices is growing at a double-digit clip. In fact, 34% of broadband households subscribe to two or more paid Internet video services. The Viacom network portfolio is a leader in the U.S. among broadband-only homes, and drives significant viewership on long-form platforms like Amazon, Hulu, and Roku, as well as on short-form platforms like YouTube and Snapchat.", "Viacom's strong position as a valued content provider in both traditional cable and the fast-growing broadband and mobile universe will continue to work in our favor as we lead the content providers into this new world. It gives us great confidence that our brand's connections with valuable audiences are as strong as ever. We will maintain our focus on improving traditional ratings, and also work to increase monetization in broadband-powered distribution by collaborating with our partners on subscription models and advertising features that will make these platforms more economically attractive.", "One of the ways we're meeting these challenges is by continuing to expand our data and ad technology capabilities, exemplified by today's announcement with Roku. Among connected device owners, Roku homes have the highest reach, average days used and hours used per day. In fact, Roku usage is greater than Xbox, Chromecast, and Apple TV combined, and that lead is accelerating. This first of its kind partnership will allow us to leverage aggregate data from Roku, enabling sophisticated ad targeting at an unprecedented scale in the TV environment. Through this partnership, we can offer better, more targeted ad product. We also have a financial investment in Roku.", "Combined with partnerships with comScore, TiVo, Symphony, Snapchat, and several others, a continuing relationship with Nielsen and our expanding internal expertise, we're building a platform that's second to none. There is no question that Internet delivery is here to stay, and we continue to grow quickly through new and bigger OTT and SVOD services, as well as an improving TV Everywhere experience.", "Now turning to a brief update on our media networks. We are rejuvenating and repositioning several of our networks and seeing positive results. Viacom had eight of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks in the 2-plus demo and nine of the top 30 in the 18 to 49 demo, one more than last year in each. We also had the highest number of top 20 cable series among core demos.", "Nickelodeon continues its leading performance, taking the number one spot in 2 to 11 for 37 consecutive weeks, and pulling away from its competitors on a total day and head-to-head basis. Blaze and The Monster Machines was the number one program across all television with young kids for the second consecutive quarter. Among kids 2 to 11, Nickelodeon owned the top two animated shows, SpongeBob SquarePants and Alvin, and four of the top five programs throughout the quarter.", "On the consumer products side, Paw Patrol is the number one preschool property with every mass retailer. The property is a success in nearly every licensed product category, including preschool toys where it is number one, apparel, home goods, and accessory.", "VH1's ratings were the best in six years, with strong double-digit gains across the board. At Spike, Lip Sync Battle remains the most watched original series in the channel's history and in season two continues to deliver a big and a broad audience. It's also a global hit, now in more than 120 countries.", "Bellator, which Spike acquired in 2011, is another global success story. Currently the fastest growing combat sports franchise worldwide, Bellator is averaging 1.2 million viewers this year, a 45% increase over 2015. Bellator held its first European event in Torino, Italy this month, with two additional international events planned this year, the first in London and airing on Viacom's channel 5, and the second in Israel. We expect Bellator to grow into a significant Viacom asset in its own right.", "At MTV, overall ratings remain soft, but MTV's programming continues to capture substantial audience share with five of the top 25 programs on cable among viewers 12 to 34. Under new overall and programming leadership, MTV is committed to bringing more live music and music inspired programming to the network. Last week, MTV put on a reimagined upfront event that was very warmly received by the ad community. The upcoming slate features 14 new series and specials fueled by top tier producing talent like Mark Burnett and, including Wonderland, the network's first weekly live music performance series in nearly 20 years, that debuts this fall.", "At Comedy Central, changing viewing patterns continue to impact ratings, but declines narrowed significantly versus the prior quarter. Comedy Central continues to develop hit new programming, including this quarter's Not Safe with Nikki Glaser, and is returning popular multi-platform shows such as Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City, Tosh.0 and Another Period. The turnaround of MTV and Comedy Central will be a driver of our advertising revenue recovery as we head into our next fiscal year.", "Viacom's International Media Networks performance continues to be strong, with even more growth on horizon. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, advertising revenues increased 6% in the quarter and affiliate revenues rose 11% in the quarter. This is an important and underappreciated part of our portfolio that has grown significantly and now includes the Paramount Channel, Channel 5, Viacom18, Spike, Comedy, as well as even better, more localized MTV and Nickelodeon networks. Ratings are strong in our international brands, particularly MTV.", "In India, Viacom and our JV partner have 16 networks and a country-leading position. We are showing strong growth in regional markets and have recently launched Voot, an advertising-supported VOD platform that will house COLORS, MTV and Nick content, as well as original long and short-form content.", "In the UK, our brands continue to show solid growth. Channel 5 reached its highest share ever in the 16 to 34 demo in the quarter, and MTV, Nick, and Comedy all posted double-digit share increases. Nickelodeon remains the number one kids' channel group in paid television.", "International markets also give us a valuable opportunity to experiment with new digital platforms and monetization strategies. For example, Play Plex, a flexible app-based distribution platform for all of Viacom's global brands, can help our paid TV operator partners create a great TV Everywhere experience for consumers, or be distributed as an over-the-top service. We are particularly excited about Play Plex as an authenticated or direct-to-consumer mobile product in markets without cable and pay TV infrastructure.", "Paramount results were disappointing this quarter, largely due to two titles that performed below expectations. We look forward to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the current quarter and Star Trek Beyond, Ben-Hur, Jack Reacher 2, Rings, and several other promising titles later in the year. Paramount Television continues to make rapid progress, with 15 shows ordered to production and an additional 10 set up at networks, including Maniac, a comedy starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill for Netflix.", "Turning to EPIX, we are looking forward to the introduction of its first two original scripted series in the fall, including Paramount's Berlin Station. EPIX has the youngest audience of all of the major premium services, and was the fastest growing premium network in the U.S., growing more than 35% year-over-year in 2015. The process of identifying a strategic minority investor in Paramount is continuing and on track to securing an agreement by the end of June. The strategic and valuation possibilities are compelling. Like the entire media industry, the motion picture business is evolving. A strong strategic partner for Paramount, particularly one that provides international and/or technological clout and expertise will provide important benefits to both Paramount and Viacom.", "In summary, we are creating more and more original programming under revitalized network leadership, and that is bearing fruit both in the U.S. and abroad. We have secured renewals with all of our major U.S. distribution affiliates. We are entering into partnerships with a number of new market entrants, including Snapchat, Roku, comScore, and more. Our international expansion will provide opportunities to drive significant value and growth for Viacom for the foreseeable future, and Paramount is poised for renewed success, driven by a full slate and a vibrant television business.", "Our entire management team is completely focused on putting the building blocks for growth in place this year. We have a smart strategy and are investing in our properties in the U.S. and around the world, setting us up to become a growth story in fiscal 2017 and beyond.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you to our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our March quarter are available on our website. Now, let's take a look at our segment results.", "At our Media Networks segment revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 4% and international revenues were substantially flat. Excluding a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 7%, reflecting growth in advertising and affiliate revenues. Page nine of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 4% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 5% and international revenues were down 1%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6%, driven by growth in Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 1%, domestic revenues declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting a modest decline in subscribers and a previously disclosed rate adjustment with a major distributor, partially offset by rate increases across the remaining subscriber base. Excluding a 7 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 11%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, and rate increases.", "Expenses increased 2% in the quarter. In operating expenses, programming expenses were up 6%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 10%. SG&A expense decreased 2% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our ongoing investment in original content. The decrease in SG&A cost was principally due to lower advertising and promotional expenses.", "Within Media Networks, adjusted operating income was down 11% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 33.8%. Decline in operating income was driven by the 3 percentage point decrease in revenue and the 2% increase in expense.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 1% in the quarter principally due to a decrease in home entertainment revenue, partially offset by an increase in license fees. Foreign exchange had a 2 percentage point unfavorable impact on Filmed Entertainment revenue growth. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues increased 6% due to higher carryover revenues from Daddy's Home and The Big Short, which were both released late in the December quarter, partially offset by lower revenues from the current quarter releases. Home entertainment revenues decline 21%, reflecting lower revenue from catalog and third-party distribution titles. Revenue from license fees increased 17%, primarily driven by the licensing of certain titles in subscription video-on-demand.", "Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $136 million in the quarter, as compared to income of $1 million last year. The loss in the quarter primarily reflects the performance of Zoolander 2 and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.", "In terms of taxes, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thank you, Wade. I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt, as well as the seasonal factors impacting our 2016 fiscal year that haven't already been discussed. In the quarter, we generated $382 million in free cash flow, which compares to $598 million of free cash flow in the March quarter of last year. Page five of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow. The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year, principally due to lower adjusted operating income.", "Moving on to our debt. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. We ended the quarter with $12.5 billion total debt and $480 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.3 times. We have $368 million remaining of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes which mature on April 30. We plan on paying these notes off.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenues, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transaction and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For the fiscal 2016 year, we continue to expect growth in affiliate revenues to be in the low/mid-single-digit range.", "For the full year, we continue to expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid-single-digits. Given the timing of shows coming on air in the back half of the year, we expect programming expense growth to be weighted to the June quarter. Additionally, we expect marketing expense to be higher in the June quarter related to the launch of these shows. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%.", "At Paramount, while it has been a difficult first half of the year, we are looking forward to our summer releases, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek 3. Given the first half performance, we expect the studio to generate a loss in fiscal 2016.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you. Could you provide a bit more color on the domestic ad revenue in the quarter? There seems to be a lot of moving pieces here. On the one hand, you've got improving ratings from your key networks, a healthy scatter market. On the flip side, you've got to make good for previous shortfalls, reduction in ad loads, and still some softness in some of your networks like Comedy Central, MTV. I guess to the extent you can help us maybe piece together some of these different factors, how much they influence the numbers, and really, what is the delta that we should look for ahead to see improvement?", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Alexia. Well, as we mentioned, we are reducing ad load on several of our networks, and we believe that will improve our brand health overall and help us as we go into the upfront where we'd like to be very strong. There is a strong demand in the scatter market, and pricing is very strong in the scatter market. But as you point out, we have limited inventory available to take advantage of that right now. And what will drive improvement, in addition to several of the networks that I mentioned improving, will be the continuing improvement at Comedy Central and MTV, which are obviously big networks for us, and where we have both have stepped up our level of programming. We have revitalized the leadership at MTV, and a new direction that advertisers welcome, and we will be able to benefit from as we head into the upfront.", "Additionally, again relating to the upfront, we now have much enhanced capabilities, driven by our Viacom Vantage and other products, which will help us drive pricing as we go into the upfront and beyond. So we think this is a period where we can, as I mentioned in my remarks, we hope to see -it is very early in the quarter, but we hope to see some improvement this quarter. And we are very focused on improving the overall brand health and going advertisers who really view us as the leading way to reach the key demos they want to reach. So we certainly feel very optimistic about not just the upfront but what that bodes for the broadcast year ahead as we continue to seek improvement as the rest of this year unfolds.", "Thomas Dooley", "And Alexia, I mean, the unit load reduction is an important step, as Philippe mentioned. If we didn't adjust for the unit loads, we would have been down around 3%.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Okay. That's helpful. And just a clarification, if I can, on one of the comments in the opening remarks. I think you said on the domestic affiliate side that you hope to get sort of a mid-single-digit range from both traditional and sort of overall. I guess is that correct? Can you get to the single just traditional load, and overall also for maybe at the high end of mid-singles? And can you still see incremental growth \u2013 I guess it's implied you can \u2013 from over-the-top or SVOD, given you've already benefited so much from those revenue streams?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yeah, so, I talked about the mid-single-digit for 2017 and beyond. Having now reached agreements with all the major distributors, we have a lot of visibility on rate increases on these long-term agreements, which give us strong visibility. There is, by the way, and you've seen some of the earnings reports by major distributors in the last few days, there does appear to be some stabilization in subscriber count on the part of the distribution community, which is encouraging. And by the way, I think that's a byproduct of more work being done in areas like TV Everywhere, customer service, and the like.", "So we certainly now have, especially with the last big major behind us, in DISH, good visibility on traditional, which is why I singled that out. And then overall, we have many opportunities to grow other forms of affiliate revenue, whether it's SVOD platforms, whether it's other over-the-top products, or even Sling, as part of our recent DISH agreement. So, we have some visibility that allows us to project the mid-single-digit. Of course, where we land on that depends a lot on what in fact happens when we go forward on subscriber counts and the like, but I'm encouraged by the stabilization that appears to be taking hold in the marketplace.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "You're welcome, Alexia.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Janedis with Jeffries.", "John Janedis", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Two quick questions. First, just back to Paramount. Assuming the transaction gets done, can you talk about the use of proceeds and how that may affect the potential to restart the buyback?", "And separately, maybe as a back up to Alexia's question, there's been nervousness in the market around the kids' advertising and money shifting to digital platforms. Philippe, you highlighted movies, but what are you seeing from the kids' vertical more broadly, and to what extent are you recapturing the revenue with some of your partnerships?", "Philippe Dauman", "So, as far as the Paramount transaction, where it's boring, obviously the use of proceeds for that and cash in general for Viacom will be used to obviously bring our leverage ratio back to where we have talked we want to be in for investment-grade purposes. We use our cash as we always have to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves, either grow our business or strategic acquisitions, like Channel 5, which of course I mentioned in our prior earnings call, turned out to be a home run. And then excess capital will be available to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, as we find availability in our buyback program. But we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. Right now, we're working to get a deal done and get those proceeds and deploy them as we do all cash that we've generated [indiscernible].", "Thomas Dooley", "This advertising market is very, very strong right now. We see no weakness. No shift, actually. Dollars are shifting back from digital into the linear format both in kids and adult.", "John Janedis", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Doug Mitchelson from UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Oh, thanks so much. Good morning. Philippe, can you talk about how your channels are positioned in Sling TV and if we should think of that as a template for any future virtual MVPD deals the company might do? And any sort of updated thoughts or comments on Comcast re-tiering Sling and CMT, if there's any sort of negotiations taking place or what your thoughts are about that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as Sling, I'm going to let DISH make its consumer announcement. But I will say that we have a broad array of networks. We did choose to withhold the Nickelodeon network for now from the Sling platform, and we will evaluate that as it goes forward.", "And as far as other virtual MVPDs, what we have learned from discussions with various players is that there are different points of view on what the consumer offerings ought to be. So, we're still in an experimental stage in that domain, so I don't expect that you will see commonalty in offerings in the marketplace. It's still early stage and we'll see how it unfolds. And in many cases, particularly for the MVPDs, to the extent they're exploring these, they're looking at it as a gateway to the broader offering of networks that you might view as more traditional, even though the delivery is getting less traditional in that they're using digital delivery and TV Everywhere kind of offerings to consumers.", "As far as the Comcast issue relating to re-tiering, we continue to deal with that privately with Comcast at this point rather than make any further comment on that, which we continue to contest.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks, Philippe, but if I could maybe \u2013 maybe I should ask a little more directly on Sling. I think there's some concern because there was a belief in the marketplace that DISH had a lot of leverage in these negotiations that you might have had given up economics at Sling to get a traditional deal done. Any clarification around that would be helpful.", "Philippe Dauman", "Nothing could be further from the truth. We are very pleased with the terms as I've mentioned in the past. And I've \u2013 I know people have been talking about this \u2013 had been talking about it for a year and a half, I said all along we have had a long and strong relationship with DISH. I had indicated that we were going to \u2013 we were confident that the deal was going to be renewed. And I'm proud to say that we were able to renew it on good terms without our networks being taken away from consumers, unlike about 20 situations involving other programmers at that distributor over the last few years. And we are set up with DISH in a very constructive relationship, with growth in rates over term on both the traditional platform and Sling.", "And we have also provided in our DISH deal a lot of new functionality that relates to TV Everywhere and video-on-demand as we, of course, brought the agreement up to date. And I think that will benefit DISH's consumers and again reinforce the ecosystem with this important distributor. And we will continue to look for new ways to work together as we go forward, as we do with all of our affiliates. And we deliver particularly valuable audiences, given our strength in the demos that I talked about in the earnings remarks. You cannot reach millennials in the way that we do. We have the leading family, so if one wants to drive services that appeal to millennials, and some of these new over-the-top products are entry points into media for millennials, we provide core services as demonstrated by the deal that we did.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Right. Thank you very much.", "Philippe Dauman", "Welcome, Doug.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research.", "Brian Wieser", "Thanks for taking my question. First, I was curious if you could give some context to the TV studio details you provided with 10 shows and 15 respectively, if you could provide year-ago equivalents or just some context in terms of the traction there.", "And separately, any updates in terms of contribution revenue that Vantage might have had in the quarter, or further expectations into the year?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, as far as the television operation, it's a start-up. We started Paramount Television less than two years ago from scratch. So the vast majority of the shows were basically picked up over the last \u2013 certainly over the last year with a lot of them over the last several months. And as shows have been green lit, they've been making a number of announcements.", "Some of them are for our own networks, like School of Rock, which has been ordered for a second season on Nickelodeon, as it's off to a great start. We're looking at an original series for TV Land coming from Paramount Television. We have an original series slated for Spike from Paramount. And this fall, we have Berlin Station on EPIX. That's just our own network. I mentioned Maniac on Netflix. We have other series for SVOD services. We have series on HBO. We have series on Fox. We had Grease: Live out very successful on Fox. We have series on Turner Networks.", "We really have series across the board. Some of it original concepts and some of them based on titles in the Paramount library. So there are many, many opportunities to create new series just starting with our own library of great film titles that can be turned into a television series. It, of course, allows us also to sell in the global marketplace. So we're very happy with the rapid lift off. And we think as series get on air, get into multiple seasons, it will be a great leg for Paramount and an important driver of long-term performance for Paramount. And it's certainly an interesting aspect of this as we explore a strategic transaction.", "Vantage \u2013 I'll let Tom supplement what I have to say on Vantage \u2013 but it's been certainly a key part of the conversation with our major branded advertisers. And remember that as I have said previously, over three-quarters of our advertising comes from our top 100 advertisers, and we are in this upfront, expecting to triple the number of Vantage participants to approximately 33 players; take the 33 against the top 100 and think of the 33 as being concentrated in the top 50, so, it's a substantial part of our upfront discussions. And we talk about Vantage and we have all sorts of other services that come with it under the Velocity and Echo capabilities \u2013 integrated marketing, social media connectivity, et cetera \u2013 and that will grow from there next year. We built up the capability to be able to ramp up to this level and we'll continue to ramp up our capability. Tom, you want to add something?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yeah, the only thing I would say is that it's not possible to break out the incremental revenue associated with it because it's part of, as Philippe said, the overall relationship we have with those advertisers. Whenever a Vantage product is introduced, it does certainly introduce this part of an expanded economic relationship with the advertiser.", "Philippe Dauman", "And it's been very, very strict.", "Thomas Dooley", "And in high demand.", "Brian Wieser", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Thank you very much. I think, Tom, you said that MTV and Comedy Central ratings need to improve for you to see advertising revenue growth. How much should they improve? Do you need them to grow year on year in 2017 to see ad revenue positive in the U.S. or just not be down 25%, 30%?", "Thomas Dooley", "Yeah, I think if they were down in the low teens, high single-digits, I think we'd be able to be in a positive position, given the growth that we have at the other network. So, we hope to be able to move into that type of situation, as Philippe indicated, as we move into 2017. The adjustment of our unit loads that we're putting in place this year will position us well to be able to do that, and we believe the programming that Comedy and MTV are putting on will position us to do that as we roll into next year.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Okay. And then one quick question. You mentioned that you see ad dollars coming from digital platforms back to pay TV. What kinds of digital are losing money? And what are your advertisers saying about the reason for that shift?", "Thomas Dooley", "Obviously, the Facebooks and the YouTubes of the world are doing very, very well in terms of growing dollars and that stays sound. It's the rest of the marketplace where there's been a lot of concern around fraudulent traffic delivery in the form of bot traffic. That has certainly fatigued advertisers' interest in those platforms. And money has come back in. And I believe that advertisers, as they look at the economic results of some of that digital advertising, have been less impressed and find television to be the platform it always has been, a very strong way to reach consumers.", "Vasily Karasyov", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next comes from Ben Mogil with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Benjamin Mogil", "Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Wanted to talk a little bit about SVOD. So, when you look at the trends in SVOD, sort of parsing out domestic and international sort of separately, do you expect domestic to sort of be up or down for the year? And then when you look at international and some of the trends you're seeing, maybe talk a little bit about where you're seeing growth, either by geographies or by types of new services on the SVOD side that are coming in.", "And when you look at some of the lessons that you sort of learned domestically about the impact on ratings, maybe talk a little bit about how, internationally, you're structuring things a little bit differently to reflect some of the things that you learned sort of in the domestic market. Thank you.", "Philippe Dauman", "So, as far as the domestic market, we have the three major distributors in Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, and then we have some others emerging or in discussions, all of whom are looking for new compelling content as it is an increasingly competitive environment among them. So we continue to see that as a growing opportunity.", "We are being selective in what programming we make available and what the windows are. And as I've talked about in prior earnings calls, we are differentiating among types of programming based on the performance that we see. And in many cases, we see a presence of our shows on SVOD, prior seasons, for example, as being an important marketing driver for a new season, a good vehicle for catch-up and other things of that nature.", "In the international marketplace, clearly, it is a fast-growing opportunity. It is a significant opportunity in many countries where there's not a robust traditional delivery market. And importantly, we are seeing a lot of these SVOD services are local \u2013 not the ones that we talk about here in the U.S \u2013 there's a lot of local competition in the marketplace. The last time I looked at it, for example, in a country like China, there are seven major \u2013 and I'm sure several others beyond the seven majors that I was looking at \u2013 SVOD players that are local. But that's not just China, in many other places, you have local MVPDs that are setting up robust services. They watched what happened in the U.S., and so they got ahead of some of the U.S. players that have now expanded globally.", "So in many countries, we're seeing the opportunity for us to be greater with local players than the U.S.-based services that are \"exporting abroad.\" At the same time, we're doing a fair amount of business with the U.S.-based ones as they look for international growth. So overall, it's a good opportunity for us. And since you bring up international, the opportunity to distribute content on various mobile services, particularly in countries where there's not a real good established paid television infrastructure, is also a significant area of growth as we look in the future.", "Benjamin Mogil", "And in some of that selectivity around windowing of programming that you're doing domestically, are you employing a sort of similar tactic abroad?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, every market is different. And in some markets, it's pretty close to [indiscernible] In a new developing market, it could be our primary form of distribution. So those markets obviously, we're happy to have our brands present in some way. That would be true at some markets in a place like Africa or certain countries in Southeast Asia, as one example. And China, of course, is a very difficult market for traditional non-Chinese players, so SVOD is, in China, a big primary opportunity for us to expose our brands and our shows for the day, hopefully, in the future where we will be able to have a greater presence in traditional forms of distribution.", "Benjamin Mogil", "That's great. Thank you very much for the color.", "Philippe Dauman", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Omar Sheikh with Credit Suisse.", "Omar Sheikh", "Morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions on Media Networks. First on affiliate revenues, could you give us the underlying domestic affiliate revenue growth in the quarter, excluding content licensing? I don't think you gave that in your prepared remarks. And could you perhaps remind us when we should expect the step down from AT&T to cycle out this year?", "And secondly, on Media Networks expenses, you gave \u2013 I think, Tom, you gave guidance on programming costs growth for this year. I wonder if you could also give us guidance on total expense growth this year. And then longer term, Philippe, maybe if you could \u2013 now that you have some stability on domestic distribution, perhaps you could sort of update us on your thoughts on how you think about investing in the core network brands from next year and beyond. Thanks.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, as far as I mentioned my remarks on the affiliate revenue, the adjustment for the AT&T direct renewal plays itself out through our fiscal year. That's why I referenced it being behind us as we head into 2017. And we don't break out specifically the categories with tighter revenue growth. And as Tom mentioned in his remark, there's a certain choppiness to the revenue recognition based on product availability in the SVOD space.", "And before Tom responds to your questions as it relates to the expense items that you talked about, we always have \u2013 I just want to make an overall comment \u2013 as far as our programming expense and investment, we always have invested in programming and grown our investment in programming. It is the source of opportunity for us to monetize in different platforms around the world. And by the way, as our international business grows, they also are generating original programming, some of which is finding its way directly into the U.S. or formats. We have formats originating here or originating in our international networks. That will be a growing opportunity. And we are -- we have been shifting dollars from acquired programming to original programming, which will benefit us in all these new forms of distribution. Tom, you want to address the...", "Thomas Dooley", "Yeah. I'm going to invite Wade to address that, I think.", "Wade Davis", "Yeah, aggregate expense costs for the year should be in the mid-single-digits.", "Omar Sheikh", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from [ph] Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Thank you very much. First on measurement. I believe Viacom worked with comScore in the creation of their new cross-platform measurement service, but of course, you're also a customer of Nielsen. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the merit of each measurement service and how long you'll be customers of both.", "My follow-up is on programming. With the rebuild at MTV and the new creation output at Comedy Central, as that is added to the schedule, is it possible that you might see less value in the prior programming that might cause some kind of write-down? Thanks.", "Thomas Dooley", "I'll take that measurement. We think Nielsen and comScore are both vital parts of the robust environment that's growing. In addition to other data suppliers that we append to the aggregate amount of information, we provide our advertisers with about the consumers that are consuming our programming that makes it more valuable to advertisers and helps them better refine the target audiences that they're trying to reach. Both services are doing very well, becoming very innovative and doing the best they can, given the samples they have to deal with. One is a very, very large sample. One is a sample of about 20,000 to 40,000 households. We think both have their attributes and we use them both to the fullest extent possible to provide our advertisers with the best possible information our audience delivers.", "Philippe Dauman", "As far as the programming, really, MTV we're adding programming. We have a lot of very successful shows on MTV, as I mentioned. We have a lot of the top shows in the 12 to 34 demographic. And whether it's the continued success of shows like Teen Mom or Shannara, which we have renewed, and Scream and so forth. But we're adding on a lot of programming, we're focusing on the M in MTV.", "And Comedy Central also has a really strong line-up, and I mention a lot of the shows. And again, I think the imperative, as we go forward, is to add to the volume of compelling millennial-oriented original programming and events. I'll just mention the \u2013 going back to MTV \u2013 the great success of the reinvented MTV Movie Awards this year, where we improved overall viewership in what was a multicast show by over 50%. And I think it was a great representation of the brand done in a new way and you'll see a lot more of that as we go forward under new leadership.", "James Bombassei", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Certainly. We'll take our final question from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.", "Daniel Salmon", "Hey, good morning, everyone. Philippe, as we've been discussing here this morning, Comcast has officially announced a deal to acquire DreamWorks for $41 a share. Just curious how you think that deal may or may not impact your discussions around the minority investment in Paramount.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, I think it shows the value. Here you have DreamWorks Animation, a studio that puts out two movies a year. So I think if you take that and look at the incredible, rich history that resides in the Paramount library, which is huge in quantity and quality, you look at the number of franchises we have, you look at the 15 movies a year, major movies that we'll be putting out year after year, you look at the growing international potential. You look at the fact that we are in the animation business, as we have animated family-oriented titles going forward, or the franchises that we are growing out of Nickelodeon, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob and others. So we have a very vital process.", "Let me give you a few more details on the process. Obviously, we won't talk about specifics until we announce a result, but we have winnowed down from over 40 companies that expressed interest. We are in the final stages of winnowing that down to a handful of strong players. They will be receiving management presentations from this period until mid-May, after which we will get into detailed negotiation, discussion, diligence, all with a view to entering into an agreement, as I mentioned in my remarks, by the end of June.", "There is strong interest from around the world and we think at this stage based on the conversations that I have had, that we will have a compelling result that will be both a strategic driver, reflect the significant value of Paramount, which, after all, is one of the greatest studios in Hollywood, with a 100-plus year history. So I think today's announcement is just a validation of the value of the highest form of content, which is motion picture content. And as I mentioned earlier, at Paramount, we have the great growth opportunity created by a new television production operation that in and of itself is a growth business for the future or Paramount.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Philippe Dauman, our Executive Chairman, President, and CEO; Tom Dooley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Philippe.", "Philippe Dauman", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Viacom's third quarter earnings call. As you know, since our last call, we have been subject to controversy relating to governance which has obviously created an overhang for our company. Last week, courts in Massachusetts and Delaware rejected motions to dismiss allowed discovery to proceed and scheduled trials to take place in October. We view these favorable court rulings as positive steps that move us ahead to a resolution. In light of the litigation, we won't be able to comment further on this topic during today's call.", "Meanwhile, Viacom continues to focus on making progress against our strategic plans. We are increasing our investments in more and more original content across multiple platforms, extending our lead in sophisticated data products, building engaging new consumer experiences through innovative, thoughtful distribution partnerships, as well as new consumer products, recreation and hospitality initiatives, expanding our formidable international presence; and forging new strategic paths, including a potential partnership to unlock the value of Paramount and provide competitive advantages for the studio and Viacom overall.", "These initiatives are the most recent manifestation of a careful, comprehensive and consistent vision for Viacom that we've pursued since I became CEO in 2006 to focus on original content, enhance our distribution revenues and build a robust international business while adapting to change. That job is never done, nor is it easy.", "There are disruptive challenges in our industry, particularly for those companies like Viacom that focus on younger demographics. But we are having increasing success at several of our brands and we are leveraging those learnings to accelerate that success at other properties. Wade and Tom will go into the numbers in a moment. First, let me review some of the drivers of our results for the quarter and what lies ahead.", "In ad sales, we concluded a strong upfront. More advertisers committed early instead of waiting for the scatter market later when inventory is scarce. This movement and ratings progress at core networks, as well as our new advertising products resulted in mid to high-single digit price and volume increases. Our end-to-end data-driven marketing solutions continue to help us lead the way in advanced advertising and our proprietary predictive engine, Vantage, is even more demand by sophisticated marketing partners. We expected to triple the number of Vantage deals from last year to this year and we exceeded that goal. In this upfront, we will secure 35 to 40 Vantage deals with our partners. Significantly, more than half are based on comScore metrics, signaling a welcome market shift to alternative currencies.", "In addition, we held the industry's first-ever datafront where we showcased our data capabilities and announced Vantage intent powered by longtime partner American Express. This exclusive, unprecedented collaboration resulted in the first product to tap American Express' unique data using predictive analytics to help marketers reach consumers even earlier in their purchase consideration process.", "These are all powerful examples of how we have transformed our company over the last several years. On the affiliate side, in the third quarter, we saw long-term deals with both DISH and Cox, both with solid annual rate increases. The decline in affiliate revenues was impacted by several factors, including the lapping of a large SVOD deal last year. As we disclosed in June, we expected to complete a significant SVOD agreement in the third quarter of this year, but recent uncertainty, coupled with our evaluation of various new distribution opportunities, have led to a slowdown of these discussions.", "As we have discussed, despite the continuing impact of changing audience behaviors and preferences, I am pleased to say that in the June quarter we've stabilized our ratings and several of our networks are leading the industry in their categories. Viacom holds six of the top 30 ad-supported cable networks; and our family of networks captures the most share in nearly every demo, 2-plus, 2-11, 2-49 and most importantly, 18-49 and 18-34; and through the five weeks of the fourth quarter, our revenue weighted ratings are up.", "Among viewers 2-plus, in the third quarter, VH1 delivered the biggest ratings gain of any of the 30 largest non-news cable networks; and Nick Jr. had the largest year-over-year ratings increase of any rated network. And we're also seeing strong traction across platforms. Viewership on our mobile apps is up 26% over the third quarter of last year.", "Nickelodeon's story is a highlight and a perfect example of our strategy across the company to broaden our revenue base and drive audience engagement. Nickelodeon's ratings increased 6% in the quarter and it extended its number one ranking among kids 2 to 11 to 52 straight weeks, increasing an already substantial lead to over 20% over our biggest competitor in the quarter in that demo.", "And the best news is that much of Nickelodeon's success is driven by a broad lineup of popular programming that is new and fresh from a variety of genres, including animation, live action and preschool. Leading the way is Henry Danger, which is the quarter's number one show among kids 2 to 11 and 6 to 11 averaging 2.4 million total viewers per episode.", "Nick's newest animated series, The Loud House, has become a runaway hit and is averaging almost 2 million viewers per episode. In the current quarter, Kids' Choice Sports outpaced last year's strong performance, up double-digits; and like all of Nickelodeon's tentpole events continues to be an extremely attractive opportunity for advertisers. On digital platforms, Nick continues to see strong year-over-year growth in video viewing, up almost 20% for the quarter across Nick and Nick Jr. sites and apps.", "Moving to the consumer products world, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Blaze and The Monster Machines, Paw Patrol and Shimmer and Shine are all strong consumer success stories with outstanding growth potential. Additionally, our recreation and hospitality efforts continue to come online. Finally, the SpongeBob musical has opened in Chicago to very positive critical buzz. We're looking forward to bringing it to New York next fiscal year.", "This is the new Nickelodeon that Cyma Zarghami and her talented creative team have been building; and we couldn't be more excited or proud of the great turnaround they've engineered fueled by strategic insight, continued investment and unwavering faith in their capabilities. There is no kids' brand with more magic than Nickelodeon right now; and we believe that their broad portfolio of legitimate hits will drive significant diversified growth for years to come.", "VH1 is also a great story and a blueprint of how investing in great content, acceleration of the development process and smart use of data can drive improved performance. VH1 expanded its ratings gain in Q3 finishing up 33%. That's right, 33%; the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.", "VH1 is making aggressive investments in distinctive programming and drilling in on what VH1 fans want. Love & Hip Hop Atlanta continues to be a juggernaut and ranked as the number one reality show in cable. In fact, VH1 has two of the top five reality cable shows. Hip Hop Honors, which aired in July, was the highest rated VH1 tentpole in 15 years, with over three million viewers. We're building on these proven properties in the current quarter with Love & Hip Hop Hollywood and the new Amber Rose Show, which we took straight to air and are developing in real-time using sophisticated applications of audience science.", "In addition, our marketing and scheduling teams at VH1 are applying proprietary learnings from Viacom's data insight capabilities to drive additional viewership and engagement, helping our hit shows gain even more audience traction. VH1 is leading the charge and we are exploring ways that these strategies can be applied seamlessly to our other adult networks.", "Comedy Central's ratings improved significantly towards the end of the third quarter, and the network is up year-over-year in the fourth quarter so far. New leadership is reinvigorating the brand; and we are looking forward to a new season of Drunk History, the premier of a new stand-up series produced by and starring Kevin Hart, and the Comedy Central roast of Rob Lowe.", "And, of course, Kyle, Cartman and the South Park gang are back for an historic 20th season premiering next month. Their anniversary celebration was the hit of Comic-Con. Their extraordinary longevity is a true testament to the creative excellence of Trey and Matt, the deep devotion of the show's fans, and the outstanding team at Comedy Central.", "The BET Awards also continued its strong run, ranking as the number one cable awards show among audiences 18 to 49 for the 2015/2016 broadcast season, claiming the top spot for the second consecutive year. Among African-American viewers, the program has ranked as television's number one awards show for the last 15 years.", "Moving on to our international Media Networks, we continue to see a strong performance by Bob Bakish and his team with both advertising and affiliate revenues increasing at double-digit levels, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.", "Looking ahead, we remain intently focused on expanding and leveraging our diverse set of assets. We continue to diversify and strengthen our brand portfolio, reflecting demographic and market specific opportunities. Ten years ago when I became CEO, our international portfolio was singularly focused on youth. Today, our portfolio is radically different with more breadth and depth with a focus on the global six: Nick, Nick Jr., MTV, Comedy Central, the Paramount Channel and Spike. In fact, the Paramount Channel, the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world, is now in 93 million homes outside the U.S.", "Our first major push beyond MTV was the Nickelodeon portfolio, which now reaches 283 million homes internationally. And we're now a major player in the adult demographic, which is significantly larger than our kids or youth segments. Comedy Central, our third global brand, is in 180 million homes outside the U.S. We now have 11 Paramount Channels, the largest ad-supported international film channel in the world, built from scratch in just four short years. And we've begun the rollout of Spike, which is doing very well for us in the three markets we've launched.", "In just the past fiscal year alone, Viacom international Media Networks launched 15 new channels, with particular focus on the Middle East and Africa this past quarter. Of course, we also have two flagship local brands in the general entertainment space, Channel 5 in the UK and COLORS in India; and both are operating extremely well. Again, two significant and highly promising businesses that did not exist at Viacom 10 years ago.", "In total, our channels now reach 3.8 billion aggregate subscribers, more than any other family of networks in the world; and looking ahead, there is very significant opportunity. The second priority is evolving from being simply an exporter of U.S. content to becoming a global content producer. We still bring a lot of high-performing domestic Viacom content to overseas markets, particularly on the kids' side, but we are also increasing production at Viacom international Media Networks for our networks around the world. In fact, there are seven in-house productions currently underway for Nickelodeon's global channels.", "Third, and perhaps most exciting for its obvious significance to our entire portfolio, we are redefining what it means to be a TV network. Across our international footprint, pay TV penetration is approximately 40%, presenting us with attractive opportunities to exploit our digital products, including the Viacom Play Plex platform.", "Viacom Play Plex provides TV everywhere functionality to cable customers, subscription services for mobile operators, as well as direct-to-consumer opportunities. We've got the infrastructure, the brands, the content and the products to quickly scale the way we get content to consumers across 180 countries.", "Finally, Viacom international Media Networks is already generating significant revenues through consumer products; and we see a lot of potential recreation, particularly retail, hotels and live experiences. These opportunities exist throughout our portfolio, but we're putting particular focus on Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.", "Now let's talk about Paramount. There is no question that studios had a rough go at the box office recently. But as they always do, we expect fortunes to turn. As you know, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows did not meet our expectations, but there are significant bright spots at the studio.", "In particular, Paramount Television continues to grow rapidly, delivering new titles in the quarter including Berlin Station for EPIX. Paramount Television will be a continuing source of growth, augmenting the revitalization of Paramount's theatrical slate. Again, it is worth noting that Paramount's television production is a business that also did not exist a few years ago. We made it a priority to return Paramount to the television production business and we made it happen.", "In the current quarter, we had the critically acclaimed Star Trek Beyond, which is still opening across territories around the world in the next several weeks. Later in the quarter, Paramount will open Florence Foster Jenkins with Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant and Ben Hur; and coming in the first quarter of 2017, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back starring Tom Cruise.", "Regarding our exploration of the sale of a 49% interest in Paramount to a strategic buyer, as we previously disclosed, we have narrowed the process down to a handful of prospects. The process has slowed down in recent weeks, but we have reason to believe that favorable court developments last week will create a better environment that will allow us to progress with several parties toward a highly beneficial transaction to present to our board.", "To conclude, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives and are confident that they will bear significant fruit as we prepare for our next fiscal year. The ratings at our domestic Media Networks are improving. Our successful upfront and continued leadership in data-driven products will allow us to take advantage of continued ratings improvements at key networks.", "Our distribution landscape will improve as we lapped the fiscal 2016 consolidation impacts and SVOD comps and we continue to grow and monetize new platforms. Our international networks group will continue to expand in scope and value and Paramount will see better days ahead through improved film site performance, television production and we hope a groundbreaking strategic alliance.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Philippe. Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and web presentation summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website.", "From a total company perspective, revenues grew 2% to $3.1 billion. Adjusted operating income was $769 million and adjusted net earnings were $419 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined to $1.05 in the quarter.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were down 3% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 7% and international revenues were up 13%. Excluding a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 18%, reflecting double-digit growth in advertising affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page nine of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues declined 1% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 4% and international revenues were up 13%. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 6 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 19%, driven by growth in Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were down 8%. Domestic revenues declined 10% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison with product made available under certain distribution agreements in the June quarter of last year. Excluding a 3 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues increased 12%, driven by the completion of certain distribution agreements.", "Expenses increased 11% in the quarter. Within operating expenses, programming expenses were up 12%, while distribution and other expenses decreased 8%. SG&A expense increased 13% in the quarter. The increase in programming costs was due to our continuing investment in original content. The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to higher advertising and promotional expense.", "Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 22% for the quarter and the adjusted operating income margin was 34.7%. The decline in operating income was driven by the 3% decrease in revenues and the 11% increase in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were up 30% in the quarter principally due to increases in theatrical revenue and license fees. Page 12 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues increased to $91 million due to the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows in the quarter. License fees increased 39%, principally driven by the licensing of certain titles and subscription video on-demand, as well as contributions from our television production business.", "Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $26 million in the quarter as compared to income of $48 million last year. The loss in the quarter reflects the underperformance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 32.8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase as compared to the prior year.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Tom.", "Thomas Dooley", "Thanks, Wade. I'm going to cover our cash flow, our debt, as well as factors impacting our September quarter of fiscal 2016 that haven't already been discussed. For the quarter, we generated $90 million of free cash flow, which compares to $300 million of free cash flow in the June quarter of last year. Page five of the web deck presentation provides the components of free cash flow.", "The decline in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower operating income and higher working capital utilization, which was due to net investment in film product. This was partially offset by lower cash taxes.", "In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. During the quarter, we repaid $368 million of our outstanding 6.25% senior notes that came due in April. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $192 million of cash and cash equivalents. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 3.6 times.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the remainder of fiscal 2016. In terms of affiliate revenue, quarterly affiliate revenue will fluctuate according to the timing of transactions and the recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements, which are tied to product availability. For fiscal year 2016, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at low to mid-single digit rate. However, due to continuing uncertainty around the timing of completion of an SVOD distribution agreement, affiliate revenues could decline at mid to high-single digit rates.", "For the full year, we expect that Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the low to mid-single digits. And at Paramount, given the underperformance of certain films in the current year slate, we expect to generate an operating loss for the September quarter as well as for the full fiscal year. In terms of taxes, for 2016, we are forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32.8%.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "John Janedis", "Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, Philippe, to what extent is the public nature of the turmoil impacting the day-to-day running of the business and negotiations with partners?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, obviously, it's somewhat of a distraction, but we're not deterred from pursuing the strategic initiatives that I described. Our brands are what drive our business. So to some extent, and probably the biggest impact has been on the ability to move forward rapidly on the Paramount transaction, which had initially been targeted to result in an agreement about a month ago. So that's certainly been slowed down. But as I indicated in my prepared remarks, they continue. And I hope that we will reach a conclusion on that that will be beneficial to the company in due course.", "So that's really the principal impact apart from the general distraction naturally, but it does not deter us from pursuing our international growth; does not deter us from getting affiliate agreements concluded; does not deter us from producing great new programming; does not deter our management teams across our networks to be really focused on building our ratings; did not deter us in getting a successful upfront; did not deter us in developing continued industry-leading marketing products; did not deter us from finding new ways to distribute our content to our audiences everywhere they are on every device they utilize; and does not deter us from continually entering into new partnerships with companies like Roku, Snapchat and comScore and on and on.", "So we're focused. We are driving value for this company, and we view any difficulties that we face as a challenge that we will overcome. We'll be creative in overcoming and really search for every opportunity.", "I touched on some opportunities that will take a while to unfold, but they're pretty exciting. When you think about the power of the Nickelodeon brand, the fact that we have ratings success for so many new shows. People used to talk about our being so dependent on SpongeBob, but now we have such an array of shows and each of those shows has consumer products opportunity around the world, particularly as we have grown our Nickelodeon footprint. And speaking of SpongeBob, this musical is really great. Now, when it hits Broadway it could be an opportunity, not just inherently, but to revitalize that property. So the opportunities are many fold.", "We have a strong management team. As you know, over the last year-and-a-half, we have reorganized significantly. We have new leadership at several of our networks. You're seeing the effects already that the new leadership is bringing. VH1 being the perfect example that I cited. So, yes, it's a distraction. But in the scope of time, it will be viewed as temporary, and our strategic initiatives continue unabated.", "John Janedis", "Okay. Thanks. And then maybe, Philippe, on the international front, advertising looks like it performed much better than peers. Can you just speak to what's driving the performance there? And is that trajectory expected to continue given the headlines coming out of Europe?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, we have seen - the UK, we have great stronghold countries and we continue to build scale, both organically with our six global brands - and by the way we have many other brands that we're driving, whether it's BET or different Nick brands and so forth. So when I'm referring to six brands, I'm talking about the ones that are global in reach, every continent and continuing to grow across as many countries in those continents as possible. But when you have in the UK, we bought Channel 5; very attractive acquisition. We revitalized the brand. I mean, literally we changed the brand logo and we have invested in programming and we have a leading position there. It's gained share.", "We've also looked to build scale in other countries and it's paying off. So we have really been building a platform last several years, which is really now coming to maturity. We still have a lot of opportunities to expand there. We're focused on building value. I've said it over and over again. And India, which is not a consolidated entity, continues to grow at extraordinary rates, will continue to grow at extraordinary rates year after year for years to come.", "We continue to add network there. It's a country with a lot of opportunity; large population, fastest economic growth rate in the world today, the top growing economy in the world with a population that just loves entertainment. So our sector is growing much faster than GDP. So I believe I talked about it the last ten years and how it's grown to this point. I believe over the next 10 years, our international assets are going to have a value that potentially surpasses the entire value of the company today on the trajectory that we have.", "James Bombassei", "John, just on the future growth productions, obviously a lot of our activities in the segments are driven by the success in the UK marketplace. While we haven't seen a significant impact from Brexit, we do anticipate that something might have some slowdown in the future quarter. And as that manifests itself, it could bring us a little bit of a slowdown but we still think the growth is going to be very, very, very strong driven by ratings gains that we've had across our networks. And just to note, the India segment is not in the consolidated results, but below the line, but is a huge and fast growing business for us. Next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks so much. Just curious, Philippe, do you remain confident in a return to mid-single digit domestic affiliate fee revenue growth in fiscal 2017 and if it's possible to disaggregate the June quarter results regarding domestic affiliate fee growth. What was core linear versus outside that'd be helpful as well? Thanks so much.", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, on the outside, I've addressed the fact that we did not complete an SVOD deal in the last quarter and we'll see what happens in this quarter; and really we're going to do the right deals in the right way as far as that goes. As to 2017, we had, as you know, significant impact of the distribution consolidation over the course of this fiscal year. We will be - once we get to the end of the calendar year, we will have lapped all of that. And so, with the average rate increases, we have good rate increase across our portfolio with no significant renewals coming up in 2017. So we've got a pretty good lock there.", "We think there's the potential for stabilization of traditional distributors, subscriber count, given that there are some benefits in terms of maintaining distribution stickiness, which we've seen from the larger, more adept entities that have resulted. And the new distribution opportunities that we have are incremental, whether it's a Sling, a better penetration of platforms like Sony Vue and the many other opportunities that are there. So that's what leads us to optimism for next year's affiliate growth.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks a lot, Philippe. And just a clarification, on the June quarter, I understand the lack of SVOD. I'm curious was there any change from the calendar first quarter to calendar second quarter in terms of flow around cord-cutting or skinny bundle impacts the traditional linear revenue stream for distribution?", "Wade Davis", "Relatively consistent quarter to quarter. The big biggest issue, 90% of the decline was due to the SVOD discrepancy on a year-over-year basis.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks so much.", "Philippe Dauman", "And one thing I'd like to point out I pointed out publicly before, because I've noted some of our competitors talking about how much such a number of networks represents of their affiliate revenue, just to bring up a so-called skinny bundle. I just want to point out that our top six networks account for close to 85% of our affiliate revenue. Our top eight networks account for close to 95% of our affiliate revenue. So some have erroneously suggested that somehow whatever falls in that little segment of the market, the skinny bundles, somehow are disadvantaged compared to others, we are not. I just want to point that out I've pointed it out before.", "Doug Mitchelson", "All right. Thank you.", "James Bombassei", "We'll take our next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks. I have two for Tom or Philippe. Can you just talk about - you've spent time talking about the SVOD deal that didn't get done in the quarter. What's holding that up? Is that a board factor or is that based on the terms of what you think the agreement will be? So what's the gaining factor for slowing down the SVOD deals?", "Philippe Dauman", "Well, again, I don't want to get into a specific situation, it's obviously not helpful to discussions we may be having. But in any deal, we always look for the right terms. As you know, there are many players out there, many players. Some of the big so-called traditional distributors which are looking at non-traditional products, virtual MVPD products, we have new distributors such as Hulu looking at creating virtual MVPD product. We have to look carefully at the interrelationship of those kinds of discussions with the licensing of shows on SVOD. And, of course, we focus on non-current and season product, library product, in that regard.", "So we just want to be thoughtful about how we conclude it and make sure that we maximize our overall value. And, again, we will, and we're not going to be beholden to timing of a particular quarter to reach a correct long-term decision. But we are having fruitful discussions. We are pursuing those discussions. And they may very well be done in this quarter, and I hope they will on attractive terms for Viacom.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. And let me just ask Tom. You said your current leverage is 3.6 times. As you know, S&P downgraded its outlook to negative. You still have your BBB-. If you're blocked from selling Paramount, what will be the impact on your cost of capital and your ability to use short-term borrowings to fund working capital?", "Thomas Dooley", "I think we have plenty of balance sheet room and don't anticipate there's any significant downside risk there in terms of our capital availability. Have $2.5 billion available under our bank line, access to the commercial paper marketplace. So we feel very comfortable with the company's overall liquidity position. We've been easily able to pay off our debt out of both our free cash flows and our continued availability in the credit marketplace. So I don't see any issue there whatsoever with Paramount. The movie business, it comes and it goes. And we fully expect Paramount to get back on track next year and provide some very positive comps.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. Thank you.", "James Bombassei", "We'll take our next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Hi, thank you. Can you provide any color on sort of domestic advertising outlook for the September quarter? I guess given the better ratings on some of your networks, can we see improvements from the decline we saw in the quarter or are make goods and a reduction ad load still a very big headwind in the quarter?", "Thomas Dooley", "I think on the quarter that we're in, because of the Olympics, I think we'll have a little bit of worse performance than we had in this quarter. But as we look forward beyond that, we start to see the favorable trend in advertising sales that we saw in this quarter continue. And the upfront that we entered into was both significant and very successful for us and our products. By products, I mean, the traditional advertising that we sell, and all the data advantage product that we sell and all the integrated advertising product that we sell. Our ad sales organization performed extraordinarily well in bringing our product to market. So we look forward to 2017 as a very important and meaningful year to get advertising sales back on track at Viacom.", "Philippe Dauman", "And also, this is where we will have our Viacom Vantage product, a mix of new currencies really, really kicking in. So, again, it's another example just getting through this fiscal year and getting to a stronger position, benefiting from the strategic initiatives that we have been undergoing over the last few years. And so, we're going to start seeing the culmination of all those initiatives in a number of areas, and this being, of course, a very important one on the revenue side.", "Alexia Quadrani", "And just a follow-up on some of the networks. You've really done a great job in turning around some of the ratings in some of your core networks, but MTV is still really struggling. I guess anything that we can look to from the outside there that would suggest some sort of positive turn in the outlook?", "Philippe Dauman", "Yeah. So MTV, we have completely revamped the senior leadership of MTV over the last several months. The team is complete. They've been working on bringing the volume and quality of development to what it was not too long ago. We really had a fallow period there. So we've remedied that. And we're going to start seeing the output from that development from the new team - in this quarter we're going to start seeing it, and then building up again as we go into the new year. That will be very meaningful for us.", "And as we've seen in some of the other networks, as you describe, whether it's VH1 or Nickelodeon, obviously you need the quality and we have a highly motivated, energized new management team to do it coming from many different other companies in our industry. But you need to have shown and you need to have to be able to fill your schedule. So with that, we have reason to be optimistic that we can improve from what has been a tough period. We're just putting in place - we put in place in other networks. So that, given that MTV is one of our bigger networks, could have a significant impact for us.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you.", "James Bombassei", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Thank you very much. Philippe, you spoke about Vantage contributing to advertising revenue recovery, hopefully, in fiscal 2017. Can you explain, please, in layman's terms your data-driven advertising initiatives on Vantage? Where are the budgets coming from? Do you get better CPM or is it better yield? Or just is it the advertiser retention program or are you attracting incremental dollars actually through that?", "Thomas Dooley", "Vasily, this is Tom. I'll take that question. I mean, Vantage product and all of our data-suite product uses - are the data that we have often in conjunction with data that our own advertisers have around their product to further target and identify a more specific audience segment that is something much more conducive to their advertising or marketing campaign goals. That is combined with our data to provide a more sophisticated and specific audience, which oftentimes is coming out of, to your point, a different advertiser pool budget. It's often measured sometimes with Nielsen data, sometimes in conjunction with Nielsen data and other data metrics and sometimes with data metrics that are stand-alone unto itself.", "These are great new products where as a marketplace we're at the very beginning of having advertisers really begin to evolve their thinking on how they want to target certain audiences. Data and the Vantage product and all the data products Viacom teams are bringing to the marketplace begin to work with advertisers on a very bespoke basis to identify unique and individual audiences.", "And then, once we identify the audiences and campaigns to reach them, we then work on the economics of the campaign. But, as you know, this has become a very significant part of our incremental revenue in the advertising business and I think into the future of the business; and we're well paced and far ahead of many of our competitors in that regard.", "Vasily Karasyov", "And how would you compare unit pricing for data-driven advertising versus traditional?", "Thomas Dooley", "Much higher unit pricing because the audience delivered is a much more specific and highly desired audience by the advertiser. It's what they would've otherwise tried to purchase and pay a lot more for a lot of people that don't fit the criteria in the broad blunt instruments that the current advertiser marketplace uses for audience reach definition.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Thank you.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's presentation.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the time to join us for our September quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Tom Dooley; Bob Bakish, who is currently President and CEO of our Global Entertainment Group and will assume the role of President and CEO of Viacom on November 15; Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kern Schireson, our EVP of Data Strategy and Consumer Intelligence.", "Please note that in addition to our press release we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to page number 2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.", "Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Tom.", "Tom Dooley", "Thanks, Jim. Good morning everyone. We have got a lot to cover today and along with Wade I am pleased to welcome Kern Schireson who will provide an overview and an update on our industry-leading data strategy. Kern has worked at Viacom for several years to develop and then expand Viacom's capabilities in this area. It's an exciting and quickly growing part of our core business.", "You will also be hearing from Bob Bakish who will discuss the recent achievements coming out of our International Media Networks business and his views on the Company overall. As you know, Bob has been selected to lead the Company as CEO and I believe that there is nobody better suited for that role. Not only has he built critical scale in our complex international businesses, but he has driven technological and strategic innovation while consistently increasing profitability.", "With that track record, his deep knowledge of our overall business and his appreciation of the people and culture that have made Viacom great he is exactly the right leader for Viacom's next chapter.", "The special committee of our Board of Directors is continuing to work with its financial and legal advisors to explore the merits of a combination with CBS. While we will not have an update for you today on that process but we want to be very clear that Viacom will continue to operate for the long term with the strategy of driving growth, building our core businesses and positioning the Company for success in the years ahead.", "We released our financials earlier today which were towards the higher end of the guidance we provided in September. On the Media Network side of the business ratings headwinds and our strategic decision to reduce unit loads at some of our networks put pressure on advertising growth in the quarter.", "However, reinvigorated high-performing networks like Nickelodeon and VH1 have shown that we can generate ad revenue quickly as ratings rebound. And we have brought new management to MTV and Comedy Central to kick start rating recoveries at those properties. In addition, we're significantly increasing our incremental revenues driven by next-generation ad products that are not defined by the traditional currencies.", "And we're working with the MVPDs on further expanding addressable digital ad insertion at scale. Bob will talk in great detail about our international business but we're seeing solid strength in those ad markets. Outside the U.S., our ad revenues increased 6% in the quarter excluding the impact of foreign exchange driven primarily by strong growth in Europe.", "On a macro level the advertising marketplace is very good right now leading to high demand for inventory across all of our networks. Our upfront was strong and scatter in the December quarter continues to look good. We're seeing spending come out of digital and back into the TV marketplace which is absorbing inventory and driving price improvements.", "All of these factors give us confidence in our Q1 results. And we expect to deliver an approximate 500 basis points improvement over the year-over-year decline in Q4. On the affiliate side, we faced challenging comps in the quarter related to a large contribution from an SVOD deal that we accounted for in Q4 2015. Absent the impact of SVOD on our core traditional affiliate revenue growth it was essentially flat. However, we're looking ahead with confidence with most of our distribution partners committed to long-term deals at attractive rates and our continued growth in cable share in the quarter.", "As OTT options continue to grow we're extremely optimistic about the particular value of Viacom's younger-skewing networks in those offerings. We're approaching each of those opportunities very strategically with the view to driving the most long-term value for the portfolio overall. The popularity of these services makes it increasingly difficult to measure consumption.", "So we've been working to fine-tune our internal metrics to capture all points of monetization and monetizable viewing including linear, cable VOD and SVOD. Based on this analysis the consumption of Viacom Media Networks content across all the domestic linear and digital platforms is increasing on an absolute basis and up 3% in the quarter year over year.", "One of the offerings we're very enthusiastic about is DIRECTV Now. It delivers a robust bundle with 11 Viacom networks in its 100 network portfolio. We view it as a complementary offering due to the marketplace opening up new options for a generation of young consumers who love our programming but have a resistance to signing up with the traditional cable-delivered bundle.", "We're also working with other existing distribution partners to define new ways to make content available to them on an increasing number of platforms. Looking ahead to the first quarter we expect to see an increase in our domestic affiliate growth to low single digits which assumes the impact of a low single-digit decline in the overall cable subscriber universe.", "Moving on to quickly touch upon some of our key networks. Nickelodeon continues to thrive, extending its winning streak to five straight quarters at number one total day with kids 2 to 11 and kids 2 to 5 with a double-digit lead against its two largest competitors. Nick's success can't be overstated. The network owned the top six shows on TV for kids 2 to 11 in the quarter including the overall number one program The Thundermans.", "The quarter's top animated program for this demo, The Loud House, is one of the fastest-growing kids hits, having launched in May at number one and stayed on top since. We're in season two already and to meet the audience's demand for this homegrown Nickelodeon show we have already announced a pickup of season three. It's a great example of our commitment to quick, assertive investments to keep our most popular content on the air and fresh which has been - which we have been applying more and more aggressively to our growing number of Nickelodeon hits.", "Moving offscreen, Nick is actively expanding its recreation offerings to serve the whole family with initiatives like the five-star luxury Nick Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic and the fast-selling family show Paw Patrol Live based on this year's top preschool show. In consumer products Nickelodeon continues to have great success with lines based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Paw Patrol. Products for Blaze and the Monster Machines and Simmer and Shine just hit shelves this summer and the demand is rising fast, particularly for Shimmer and Shine which was the Halloween custom favorite this year, a traditional indicator of a property's growing popularity.", "VH1 continues to build on its upward momentum, closing out the quarter with three of the top non-sports cable shows and number one rated reality show Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. For the fiscal year VH1 boasts the fastest-growing growth among cable's top 20 and has delivered ratings increases in five consecutive quarters.", "Chris McCarthy has done an incredible job of driving success at VH1 and last month we added oversight of MTV to his portfolio. He is fired up about the turnaround opportunities there and we're expecting big things from him.", "A quick note about Comedy Central which has been a key focus of ours. South Park has opened its 20th season with the highest ratings it's had for several years. The episodes that aired in the fourth quarter were up 27% over the previous season and the season premiere was the show's highest-rated episode in a decade. We're also seeing more and more momentum behind Trevor Noah as his audience continues to build. The election has put The Daily Show front and center again as Trevor has delivered his highest monthly ratings in October and was the highest-rated and most-watched daily late-night talkshow among millennial men. We're projecting that fiscal Q1 is going to be his best-rated quarter ever.", "Finally, the upcoming film slate from Paramount Pictures includes an incredible lineup of filmmakers and stars. This November the studio will release the critically acclaimed film Arrival starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner as well as Allied starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. In December the studio will release the comedy Office Christmas Party starring Jennifer Aniston along with Denzel Washington's Fences and Martin Scorsese's highly anticipated Silence based on the acclaimed novel. It's a very strong slate.", "At Paramount TV, Berlin Station is already in production on seasons 2 and 3 for EPIX. And Shooter starring Ryan Phillippe and executive produced by Mark Wahlberg premieres November 15 on U.S.A. It's a quickly growing business and currently Paramount has 30 shows in development.", "Now let's turn the call over to Wade for more about the numbers.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Tom. Today I'm going to cover our operating results, our cash flow and our capital structure including steps we've taken to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. I will also speak to seasonal factors impacting our fiscal 2017.", "Looking at the full year on a total Company basis Viacom generated $12.5 billion of revenue, $2.7 billion of adjusted operating income, $1.2 billion of operating free cash flow and $3.68 of adjusted earnings per share. For the September quarter total Company revenues were $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $538 million. Adjusted net earnings were $273 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.69 for the quarter.", "Now let's take a look at our segment results. At our Media Networks segment, revenues for the quarter were down 11% compared with the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 14% and international revenues were up 2%.", "Excluding an 11 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact international revenues were up 13%, reflecting double-digit growth in affiliate and ancillary revenues. Page 8 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance.", "In terms of advertising worldwide revenues declined 8% in the quarter. Domestic revenues were down 8% and international revenues were down 7%. Excluding foreign exchange which had a 13 percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising grew 6% driven by continued growth in Europe.", "In terms of affiliate revenues worldwide revenues in the quarter were down 16%. Domestic revenues declined in 19% in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenues from SVOD arrangements as we made a strategic decision to reduce the amount of programming we license to these distributors.", "International affiliate revenues increased 7% in the quarter. Excluding an 8 percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international affiliate revenues increased 15% driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain SVOD arrangements.", "Expenses decreased 2% in the quarter. Within operating expenses programming expense was 5% lower while distribution and other expense decreased 20%. SG&A expense increased 9% in the quarter. The decrease in programming expense in the quarter was principally driven by the timing of airing of original programming. The decline in distribution and other expense primarily reflects lower participations in residuals related to lower SVOD revenue.", "The increase in SG&A cost was principally due to severance and other employee-related costs. Media Networks adjusted operating income for the quarter was $750 million and the adjusted operating income margin was 30%. The decline in adjusted operating income was driven by the 11% decline in revenues, partially offset by the 2% decrease in expenses.", "Moving to Filmed Entertainment revenues in the quarter were down 24%, principally due to the decrease in theatrical revenues. Page 11 of the web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues decreased to $203 million due to the difficult comparisons to the strong international performance of Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation in the September quarter of last year. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $137 million in the quarter. The decline versus the prior-year quarter reflects lower revenues as well as a previously disclosed $115 million programming impairment charge.", "In terms of taxes, the full-year adjusted effective tax rate was 31.7%, reflecting a 50 basis point increase as compared to the prior year. In terms of our debt, it remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter end of 4.6%. We had $11.9 billion of total debt and $379 million of cash and cash equivalents.", "At the end of the quarter our leverage ratio was 3.9 times. We took several steps to address our near-term maturities and liquidity needs. Subsequent to quarter end we issued $400 million of 2.25% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 3.45% senior notes due in 2026. Following the issuance we initiated the redemption of the $400 million outstanding of our December 2016 notes and the $500 million outstanding of our April 2017 notes. We also reduced our dividend by 50% starting with the payment we made on October 3. This will provide us with over $300 million of incremental liquidity on an annual basis. Given our strong free cash flow generation, we plan to delever over time in order to preserve our investment-grade status.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting fiscal 2017. For the full year we expect that the Media Networks programming expense growth rate will be in the mid to high single digits.", "In terms of Media Networks SG&A expense we anticipate year-over-year growth to be weighted to the first half of the year due to the timing of spend on multiplatform and data products as well as advertising and promotion expense related to the marketing of new original series. For Paramount given the timing and mix of our films we anticipate higher P&A expense in the December quarter. This will result in difficult bottom-line comparisons to the prior-year quarter.", "In terms of taxes for 2017 we're forecasting a book tax rate of approximately 32%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability mix.", "With that I'd like to turn the call over to Kern.", "Kern Schireson", "Thank you, Wade. As we've discussed on prior calls Viacom has been investing in data capabilities over the past several years. These investments in research, first party data and advanced data science are delivering better insights and new tools across our business. A better understanding of our fans and a more sophisticated perspective on how, when and where our content fits into their lives means better support for programming, scheduling, acquisitions, marketing and of course our ad sales business.", "In advertising sales it's perhaps easiest to measure the economic impact of these advances as we can transparently benchmark against the outcomes from traditional approaches to targeting, transacting and measuring the value of television advertising. Because TV advertising has for years been measured only in terms of age and gender-based segments, females 18 to 34 for example, advertisers and publishers alike have had to sell, plan and deliver campaigns around metrics that do not actually match with the advertiser's true target audience. Because we can't communicate with precision around who an advertiser wants to reach or to whom, in fact, an ad was delivered, both sides of the marketplace suffer.", "Let's put this in concrete terms. Imagine an auto manufacturer wants to reach truck intenders, consumers who may be in the market for a new pickup truck in the next 90 days. In the traditional currency of television, this advertiser would only be able to buy and plan against a traditional demo like males 18 to 49. Publishers who guarantee delivery against that metric would logically deliver units optimized to reach those males 18 to 49 as all other impressions, a 52-year-old for example who might very well be actively shopping for a truck, would be considered waste and would not be appropriately valued. Now, however, our increasingly sophisticated use of data from multiple sources allows us to understand our audience in more detail than ever before. For the first time it's possible to accurately identify our fans and viewers not just by their age and gender but their income, location, brand awareness, shopping patterns, intentions and even aspirations.", "Ultimately, this high-resolution view of our fans and our advertisers' target audience allows us to better match advertiser campaigns with our content. This means better results for our advertisers and for our own business.", "Going back to that truck intender we talked about, Viacom would use all available privacy compliant data to identify households in which a truck ad could have maximum impact and we would optimize delivery against those homes. The advertiser, in turn, can now measure the success of the campaign and pay Viacom for those impressions that reach the actual target, not a blunt proxy based only on age and gender.", "I'd like to take a moment to talk about the infrastructure required to do this as it represents a very real and proprietary position of leadership for Viacom. We started with our first party data management platform fueled by direct one-to-one engagement with our fans on social and digital platforms which in total represent more than half the households in the U.S.. Over the last two years we have extended that reach with unique access to set top box data from tens of millions of homes, real-time location data from hundreds of millions of mobile devices and commerce patterns from multiple sources including, but not limited to, our multiyear exclusive partnership with American Express.", "All of this data representing literally billions of new data points informing our perspective on the intersection of content and commerce each month is carefully de-identified, combined and analyzed by our teams of researchers, marketers and data scientists. From the perspective of our advertisers, these improvements in audience precision and the better matching of content and viewership with their campaign yield demonstrably higher engagement and more measurable impact. Based on these results we have seen 100% retention and steady year-over-year growth in advertiser participation.", "Further, when fewer impressions are delivered outside the intended target those impressions that would otherwise be considered wasted for one advertiser can be intelligently allocated to other advertisers for whom they deliver real value. With television inventory fundamentally oversubscribed every impression that is reallocated for greater impact translates directly to our bottom line. All of this has been talked about for many years, but in many cases has lived only in the realm of theory or it was perceived to be locked up with the long-term potential of one-to-one addressable advertising.", "At Viacom, however, we have begun to see real results from our growing capabilities in data science, as it has enabled sophisticated targeting; advanced currencies; and more precise and transparent reporting of results. In this last upfront Viacom wrote more than 50 deals that included Viacom Vantage, our advanced data products which allows advertisers to target and guarantee against these new metrics. In total, the advertisers who participated in Vantage represented close to $1 billion of upfront commitments spanning nine key verticals in 10 major buying regions.", "While some of the value unlocked in this approach will grow and show an even greater impact as the infrastructure for addressable TV matures, even today we're seeing real value returned to the marketplace through more efficient and transparent audience measurement. Our benchmarks demonstrate that we're unlocking measurably better outcomes for advertisers. We're already seeing this upside in the revenue per impression delivered through Viacom Vantage.", "As we continue to work together with our partners in the linear television ecosystem to scale this capability across a larger portion of the dollars transacted on Viacom, that growth will continue. As we identify new ways to measure and value impressions delivered outside of the linear ecosystem, most of which go entirely unmonetized or undermonetized today, we anticipate an even greater impact on our advertising business.", "And now I will turn it over to Bob.", "Bob Bakish", "Thank you, Kern. Before I begin I have to say a few words of appreciation. Tom Dooley has dedicated 35 years of his life to this Company as a driving force behind many of its biggest wins and a steady hand during times of transition and most recently provided assured excellent leadership throughout the changes this year. I'm honored to be taking the handoff from him and I'm grateful for his wisdom and counsel.", "I'd also like to say thank you to Sumner, Shari, Tom May and the entire Viacom Board for this amazing opportunity but even more so for their tireless drive to do right by Viacom. And while the Board and its special committee consider whether a CBS transaction makes sense they have asked me to maximize Viacom's potential as an independent Company and I'm committed to doing just that. I'm very excited about this new role and the many opportunities at hand for us.", "I've already pulled together the senior team across the Company and we're at work identifying near-term opportunities to accelerate our evolution while building a long-term vision for the future. At the same time, I'm re-immersing myself in the domestic business with a focus on how we can strengthen MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount.", "While we have our challenges we also have an incredibly strong foundation from which to build. It is important to remember that Viacom has the highest share of viewing in the U.S. among all cable groups in every demo in which we compete and worldwide Viacom is the largest global media Company by reach. We have a very strong footing and I look forward to sharing more detailed plans on how we can build off it as soon as I can.", "But today I want to take the opportunity to give you a bit of a window on how I think and how I operate. The best way to do that is to look at how we've transformed Viacom International Media Networks.", "I joined Viacom's international business in 2007. It was at a crossroads. Too focused on MTV, too dependent on the U.S. for content, too disconnected from market to market around the world.", "In the past decade our team has addressed these issues and built a true multinational organization. We've diversified dramatically to a portfolio that includes widely distributed MTVs, Nickelodeons and Comedy Centrals, the growing Spike brand and a Paramount channel, now the largest ad-supported movie channel in the world and two key local players in the UK's Channel 5 and India's Colors.", "In 2006 MTV accounted for over 80% of our business. Today no brand accounts for even 30%. We have become a global producer of original content, not just an exporter.", "We have 2,700 hours of original programming planned for 2017 and much of that consists of highly exportable formats with modest cost per episode. And we've built an organization that is interconnected across brands, businesses and geographies while fostering a culture that prides itself on entrepreneurship, innovation and adaptability. As a result, Viacom International Media Networks just closed its best year ever.", "Looking ahead we continue to be hugely focused on scale, brands, content and products. First, scale. Our number one priority in international is to get bigger. We've done this through organic expansion of Nickelodeon and Comedy Central globally and through the more recent international launches of paramount Channel, Spike and Nick Jr. And we've done very well with big mass-market general entertainment networks in priority markets.", "Channel 5 in the UK is driving. It just delivered its most profitable year ever and it gives Viacom the highest share of any international media company in the biggest market outside the U.S.. We also have a leading position in India through our Viacom 18 joint venture home to the Colors brand which is now the fastest growing media company in the fastest growing media market in the world.", "Second, on brands, the keyword is focus. Rather than launching additional U.S. brands internationally we focus on international core six: MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., Comedy Central, Paramount Channel and Spike. We're investing to grow these brands while maintaining a lean, powerful portfolio that will be attractive to both pay-TV and emerging distributors, particularly virtual MVPDs.", "And within that footprint we have plenty of room to grow. Comedy Central and Paramount Channel remain far less penetrated then MTV. In 2017 we already have launches planned in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Benelux, Asia and more.", "Third, on the creative side Viacom International Media Networks emergence as a global content engine has energized our team and strengthened our ability to localize formats. We shoot multiple versions of our biggest hits concurrently with great economics at our new studio in Miami, channel 5 in London and production hubs in Amsterdam and Madrid.", "It's a formula that works. Our UK version of Jersey Shore, Geordie Shore, regularly beat Game of Thrones in the demo in its premier timeslot. Yes, you heard that right. Audience share for MTV, Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. is up as we localize more formats and increase international production for global use. Meanwhile, we continue to export a lot of U.S. programming, particularly Nickelodeon which does very well.", "Fourth and finally, products. Redefining what it means to be a branded TV network across platforms through product innovation is a huge priority for us. Pay-TV penetration outside the U.S. is well under 50%, meaning broadband growth across fixed and mobile platforms has the potential to more than double our distribution by the end of the decade.", "I believe this is the single biggest opportunity for our business internationally. And while the economics of digital distribution still trail linear, we believe incremental expansion of our reach will pay big returns in the long run for our brands and businesses.", "Last year's launch of our Viacom Play Plex suite of apps for our international brands was a big step forward in this regard. Each app features full episodes, clips on demand along with a live linear feed. We tailor distribution market by market to reach well beyond our linear footprint. For example, we have authenticated deals with pay-TV partners in Mexico, mobile distribution with partners in Asia, our over-the-top and direct to consumer as we've done with BET Play in more than 100 markets worldwide where BET doesn't have a linear feed. Further, we're proving that product innovation can exist within a traditional TV environment with our personalized, interactive, linear channels My Nick Jr. and My MTV.", "I believe a lot of our successful international approach can be brought home to the domestic market. I've seen it work and it's a big reason that I'm truly optimistic about Viacom.", "As I said earlier, I'm working with the senior management across the Company to identify short-term opportunities while building on a long-term strategy. MTV is clearly a priority for me. We have had a lot of success in evolving and strengthening that brand internationally and I'm very pleased with the recent leadership change here in the U.S..", "I will seek more collaborative and forward-thinking partnerships with our long-standing domestic distributors. And I will also be working closely with Paramount.", "Finally, I will make sure we have a structure that supports speed, sharing of resources and a global outlook. It's imperative that we operate more globally. The opportunity is there. Viacom is home to some of the world's most iconic and internationally resonant brands. I've seen what those brands and our phenomenal people can do when equipped with a focused forward-looking strategy and a strong organization for which to create and connect with millions.", "I want to thank our shareholders for their continued support and commitment to Viacom. I look forward to keeping you informed of our plans and progress and thank you for joining today's call. I also look forward to an open dialogue.", "With that I will pass it back to Tom.", "Tom Dooley", "Thanks, Bob. Before we open the call for Q&A I'd just like to acknowledge my appreciation to the investors and analysts on the call. When I started in this business models were being done by hand on green spreadsheets. Everyone has come a long way since then but I do believe our Company, our industry and the investing public is very well served by the professionals on this call. It's truly been a privilege to work with you all for so many years. Thank you.", "And now with that I'd like to open the call up to questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on in a world of skinnier bundles, can you walk us through the puts and takes specifically from a financial perspective of keeping all of your smaller networks, what would be the impact if you chose to reduce your exposure and is it a consideration? And then the second question is, are you still confident you can achieve positive affiliate revenue growth once you circle the reset, the last step down of the reset of AT&T renewal?", "Bob Bakish", "This is Bob. Why don't I start? A couple of points. One is remember the big picture perspective that we, Viacom, had the largest share of viewing of all pay-TV network companies. More specifically, if you look at our portfolio of networks and you take our top six networks roughly 80% to 85% of the affiliate revenue accrues to those and if you go to the top eight that number goes to 90% to 95%. So even if you were to look at a scenario where you were to thin the portfolio a bit, the vast, vast majority of economics would be maintained.", "Second point I'd make on skinny bundles is with the particularly the AT&T DIRECTV announcement and their pack, skinny is not really that skinny and we're thrilled with that deal. We believe it absolutely reflects a marketplace understanding of the value of networks. And there we're going to be among having the most, the largest portfolio of networks on the platform with 11.", "So that I think is also a very strong statement. I would say broadly speaking this is a very exciting development in the category, OTT delivery of services and bundles of networks, particularly the ones that are pay-TV friendly like the ones I just discussed.", "It is also, by the way, a huge opportunity internationally services, like Sky Now. And remember, international pay-TV penetration is far lower than domestic and so we will provide a lot of upside. Very exciting development for the industry for sure.", "In terms of the positive affiliate, yes, we're confident that we will have a return to growth in the affiliate side of the business as we move forward, even and particularly when you look at domestic, even assuming a universe decline. So our guidance for fiscal Q1 of mid-single-digit 3%-ish growth assumes a 3% decline in the universe. So we will still grow even if there is a universe decline and then internationally, again, we see significant growth and you saw the numbers in the quarter.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Tom, you will certainly be missed and Bob congratulations. A question for both. Tom, in our discussions on virtual MVPDs you have had some concerns regarding their need for marketing and programming spending relative to their retell pricing. You sounded more bullish this morning on virtual MVPD prospects.", "So, one, has your view changed on virtual MVPDs or has it evolved at all? And two, if they are important can you give us any insight on what happened with Sony and the PlayStation Vue announcement on Viacom channels?", "And then for Bob, on the call Wade talked about leverage at 3.9 times and a goal of maintaining investment-grade. And at the same time, you are taking the reins of a Company that investors believe has underinvested in U.S. operations. My question is, is there any tension between the balance sheet and your ability to execute on a revitalization strategy for the U.S.? Thanks.", "Tom Dooley", "Well, first of all, we're very excited about some of the new entrants into the virtual MVPD space. We think there is substantial companies who unlike some of the brand participants and the people who tried to get into this space they are folks who understand the business, understand marketing and put significant resources behind their efforts.", "And working with them, seeing the interfaces that they have planned we think these are great consumer products that will hit the market and deliver great value for us, consumers and the distributors who are putting them into the marketplace. So we feel pretty good about that. As far as the announcements as of last night that's an ongoing negotiation. We'll see how that plays out.", "We're highly confident and comfortable that Viacom's channels will be on the successful MVPD platforms in the future. Bob, would you like to talk about -", "Bob Bakish", "Yes and as the second part of your question the short answer is, yes, I am confident that we will be able to quote, unquote invest to drive a turnaround in our U.S. services. A lot of it is about strategy as well and I mentioned MTV, it's clearly one of the services we need to improve here.", "If you look at the MTV EMA which happened in Rotterdam last weekend and you look at its performance on the MTVs all around the world, it is a clear indication based on the data I've seen to date of just how powerful improving your platform can be. Because the MTV share in general is up, but the data I have on the EMAs which isn't all markets yet, it takes time to cobble it together internationally, is on 12 to 24s we were up 59% and on 15 to 34s we were up 42%.", "So, again, it speaks to the vitality. And it's not like we invest far more than the U.S. in MTV. In fact, we invest far, far less. And if you look at the EMA it costs a fraction of what the VMA costs. So, sure, you have to look at resources you have on hand, but I'm absolutely confident that with the resources that Viacom commands, particularly in a world where you can redeploy some of those, we absolutely have the firepower to do it.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.", "Dan Salmon", "I was hoping, Kern, you could talk a little bit more about Vantage Intent. You spoke about better integrating commerce data, commerce patterns and I know that you've got a really interesting partnership with AMEX there.", "I'm interested to hear a little bit more about where you might be able to seek out intent data, commerce data and bring it into your platform more. Then one for Bob, in your prepared remarks you talked a lot about, one comment you made was about doubling distribution by the end of the decade internationally. Obviously, there's a lot of variables in that, launching new networks, growing penetration of access. What would you think is the single most important one to achieving a goal like that? Thanks.", "Kern Schireson", "This is Kern here, I will take Vantage Intent for a second. You are right it is an incredible partnership. We have an exclusive deal with American Express that makes us the only television publisher that can use the predictions that come out of their platform.", "Essentially the way that that works is American Express has this unique asset in their closed loop network. And they can look at patterns that reveal shifts or pending shifts in life stages that can help folks in a number of different categories target people who are about to make a change, about to start purchasing differently or about to make some major investments.", "In those persuadable audiences, people who are about to embark on moving in with a partner, purchasing a new vehicle, growing their family, those are really, really exciting moments and they fit really well with television advertising because it's an opportunity to shape brand perceptions and drive purchase patterns for the long term.", "So this tie-up with American Express where they generate segments that we can exclusively enable for the television marketplace creates tremendous, tremendous opportunity for advertisers where you've got these long consideration cycles and long-term purchase patterns that are about to be established.", "Bob Bakish", "And to your second question I really do believe it's the most significant opportunity facing not only our Company but our industry today. And if I was to sum it up with one important enabler I would use the word focus. And we have through the last decade built a true multinational organization which has connected leadership around the world. So we're set up to execute. We have a strategy that says this is a real opportunity and everyone, particularly on the distribution side but more broadly, is aware of that, educated on that and focused on that in our organization.", "And as we build we talk about this, what we call VIM in Viacom International Media Networks' core six. And it's all about focusing our investments on content and, call it, broad marketing and promotion including what you are doing in social and the like on those brands so that they are as strong as possible and have a solid footing regardless of the distribution platform.", "Clearly we're very focused on the MVPD space. But the good news about the V-MVPD space is increasingly these are platforms that are operated and, therefore, consistent with some of the philosophies that have built the pay-TV industries. So by focusing on it, having the right product mix, making sure your teams are really running at it, that is the key enabler. Because there is not a shadow of a doubt that the distribution infrastructure, particularly through mobile, will be there and there is not a shadow of a doubt that the appetite for consumers is there. So it's really about prioritizing it and filling it.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson", "I have one for Bob and then one for Wade and Tom. Bob, I wonder what's your view philosophy on SVOD deals and how does your thinking change versus maybe the previous administration in SVOD deals?", "Bob Bakish", "So I believe you've got to look at everything. Again, we start with we have a long history in the pay-TV business. We have deep partnerships around the world with pay-TV operators and we believe there's incremental opportunity there. Then we believe that they are supportive of content businesses such as ours. So we come with a lens of looking for a pay-TV-friendly strategy. And in the last quarter we've done a mix of deals in traditional pay.", "By the way, you can see that today we announced that Spike is going 24 hours in the Netherlands with Ziggo. Ziggo is a Liberty Global company. We have a very significant relationship and partnership with Liberty Global and they are, obviously, a key customer of ours and it's a partnership that works for both of us and I think the indication is we continue to do more things with them.", "That's very healthy. At the same time, on the OTT side many of these platforms increasingly are, let's use the word, related to a traditional player. The canary in the coal mine on that, probably, was Sky Now in the UK and really all the distributors around the world I think it's fair to say are looking at playing in that space.", "Then when you look at the traditional - traditional is a bad word, the SVOD category you think of aggregators, we will look at that on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, consider specifics about a market and a specific player and a specific ask and determine what we want to do there. They certainly have a role in the world from a consumer perspective, but we're looking at it as part of a holistic strategy and that will dictate what we do.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. Then one last one for Tom or Wade. If we look at Paramount the past year and you backed out that writedown Paramount's profits still fell by over $400 million year over year. I wonder how much of that decline can you tie back to maybe the release schedule versus other systemic issues there. So can you help us try to figure out how quick could you get back to breakeven if the release schedule becomes more normalized let's say?", "Tom Dooley", "I will let Wade contribute, but I think it's going to be a function of the pictures more than anything else. As I mentioned the pictures that we have lined up in this quarter we've already been happy with the way Jack Reacher has performed. We're very excited about Arrival and Allied and the other two distribution deals that we've got keyed up and I think those that's the beginning of the turnaround.", "You know, the way the flow-through of the business works in terms of profitability. We have P&A upfront, the first few quarters are going to be negative but we think that Paramount as it gets to the back half of this year will have very successful opportunities to begin to turn around and get back to profitability. In particular, we have this little film called Transformers 5 coming out that we have great expectations around and think it's going to be one of the biggest movies of this summer. Wade? Do you want to add to that?", "Wade Davis", "Just to get back to your question, Michael, there is nothing more systemic embedded in the underperformance this year. It was really a function of the release slate in 2016 and also the carryover from some of the release slate in 2015. So beyond the underperformance of the 2016 slate there is nothing systemic underlying that and I think as Tom said we have a high degree of confidence in the turnaround at Paramount getting at or around breakeven.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from John Janedis with Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "You touched on this a little bit, but acknowledging there are a couple of outcomes here, can you talk a little bit more about your key priorities domestically and to what extent you will have the ability to make decisions when and where necessary? As you know, one of the concerns in the market has been underinvestment in key brands and then, obviously, the complex leadership structure. Thanks.", "Bob Bakish", "That sounded like that was for me. So couple of things. As I stated in my remarks, I have been chartered by the Board to focus on running Viacom as an independent Company. That is very much my mandate and what they have asked me to do. As part of doing that I believe we have got to bring the team together and I'd then unlock really what I've convinced is a whole lot of great thinking throughout the organization and all levels of the organization and then identify through that the ideas we want to bring to life.", "When you look at it from the top down there some clear weakness areas, as we talked about MTV. Comedy Central we had some recent good trendlines in Trevor, who by the way Trevor Noah is significantly stronger internationally than John was. So the Trevor Noah franchise is a great one and the fact that he is really connecting through this election cycle is a very exciting development.", "And also South Park's 20th. A 20-year-old franchise and the new episodes are doing extremely well and that's another global franchise. So there is some good stuff starting to happen at Comedy Central and, obviously, we'd like to see more happen.", "On the Paramount side, as Tom and Wade indicated and I've been speaking with Brad regularly and just starting to get into that, obviously the film slate will be highly important. We're also going to see what we can do on the marketing side in the short term to see if that is an incremental opportunity.", "So I think there's a clear set of priorities and I'm convinced that by working with the team we will unlock a good action plan. Obviously, part of that will be content investments. But I think it's important that based on, you understand that based on my experience a lot of this is about mix of investments, not about you have to spend dramatically more money necessarily.", "Again, our international experience shows that you can deliver very significant audiences in genres other than high dollar scripted programming. So I think mix will continue to be an opportunity.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.", "Vijay Jayant", "On your advertising side can you just talk about obviously on a revenue weighted ratings impact and your low ad revenues - low ad loads, how much was the mix between those two factors and when can we start anniversarying the low ad loads impact? And then I just wanted to follow up on the affiliate fee side. You talked about positive growth trends there.", "I think we're anniversarying the first year of the AT&T DIRECTV deal. I think there are some re-tiering impact from Comcast early next year. Is there any further impact from the Charter-Time Warner deal that we should think about in that impact? Thank you.", "Wade Davis", "This is Wade. In terms of the first part of your question, the unit load reduction had about a 4 percentage point impact in the quarter. And we think that that is behind us in terms of looking forward to the balance of the year.", "Tom Dooley", "And we think a lot of the other - in the guidance that we've talked about here today factors in the other elements that you mentioned and as Bob mentioned and reinforced a low mid-single-digit decline in universe estimates. So we've had good negotiations and good relations with all of our distributors, our deals go far out into the future and we feel that we're in good shape to resume affiliate fee growth in 2017.", "Jim Bombassei", "Operator, we will take our last question please.", "Operator", "We will take our final question from Vasily Karasyov with CLSA.", "Vasily Karasyov", "I think it's for Bob and Tom. I just wanted to drill into the Paramount situation a little more. If I am hearing you correctly, you think that the slate, upcoming slate will lead to profitability late in fiscal 2017. But I was wondering if you look back at what happened over the past several years, the deterioration in earnings there, do you think there needs to be a change in how the greenlighting process probably works? Because the industry press says that the studio management says that there was under investment which is hard to believe when you look at production budgets. So I was wondering if you could reconcile those for us.", "Tom Dooley", "I think that the pictures that we've put into production over the past several years, we had several big pictures that underperformed dramatically relative to what we had thought they would do. A good example of that is Zoolander and another example of that is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Those films really had losses that were outsized and really created a hole in the bucket that we had in the previous year, a consequential hole in the bucket.", "I think we have looked at the greenlight process. I think Brad Grey and his team, he's made changes on his team and is focused on putting in place the kind of movies that we think will result in a significant turnaround and refocused on bottom-line profitability and the type of movies that he's putting into production.", "And as I said as we look down the road here and I think as we get through the end of this quarter you will see Paramount having much better performance in the pictures that it is putting into the marketplace. And I think the most important thing to look for is how they perform relative to the competition. And I think you will see Paramount beginning to stand up and distinguish itself in that regard.", "Vasily Karasyov", "Do you feel there was underinvestment in Paramount films?", "Tom Dooley", "I think we can debate that all day long. I think the films that were put into production obviously had - I think the commentary would be did we invest in things like Marvel or other big acquisitions like some of our competitors did? Obviously, those were sound acquisitions and worked out well for them.", "I'm not so sure those would have worked out in a similar way for Viacom. Nor did we have the financial resources to make those kind of investments at that point in time. So I'm not going to debate the level of investment in history because it doesn't pay to look back and hypothesize as to what it would have been.", "Jim Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Cyma Zarghami, our President of the Nickelodeon Group.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.", "I want to refer you to Page number 2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.", "Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on the call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "Thanks, Jim, and thanks to everyone, for joining us today. I'm happy to report Viacom delivered a solid fiscal second quarter, one in which we continued to show improvement, growing revenue in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. On the Media Networks side, increases in affiliate revenue, along with continued international strength, drove top line growth. On Filmed Entertainment, Paramount increased revenues across all of its business units. At the total Viacom level, revenues were up 8%, and we grew adjusted operating income 4% in the quarter.", "Reported operating income was down 43%, driven by $280 million in restructuring and programming charges incurred as we realign and invest to fuel our new strategy. Wade will speak to all the numbers more a little later. But first, I'd like to take you through what I see as the headlines of the quarters beyond the financials. These come in four broad buckets: strategy, organization, our balance sheet and general execution, which is our increasing focus.", "First, on strategy. On our last call, back in February, we laid out a comprehensive strategy for turning around Viacom. To put the full power of Viacom behind our flagship brand, to elevate our approach to content and talent, to focus on partnerships, to grow our brands beyond linear, both in digital and off-media; and to continue to strengthen our organization.", "In the past few months, my team and I have spent considerable time sharing this new strategy with all of our key constituents, from our distribution, advertising and creative partners, to our employees and to you, our investors. And I'm happy to say that, throughout these conversations, the strategy was well received.", "Second, organization. In the last quarter, we've made important progress on our enabling organization with the new senior leadership team now fully in place. The biggest news here is leadership at Paramount. As most of you know, we've hired Jim Gianopulos to run the studio. Jim is a smart, seasoned executive with the operating expertise to help the studio address its strategic challenges of the last several years and the strong creative relationships to help jump-start its pipeline.", "Since early April, I've been working closely with Jim, and he is working closely with the senior team at Paramount to chart a new course for the studio. He is also working with leadership in our Media Networks to help map out long-term plans for co-branded films.", "More broadly and across the company, we continue to take significant steps to ensure that our structure aligns with our strategy. We're breaking down the silos that have impeded broader collaboration across the company in the past.", "For example, we recently announced Kern Schireson as Viacom's first Chief Data Officer and made moves to unify our research and audience science teams to further strengthen our data, media analytics and consumer insights across the company.", "We also announced the creation of a new global product development group to more effectively develop and launch authenticated multiplatform products across our portfolio, principally to support the pay-TV viewing experience. That group will also ensure that we're bringing some of our international success stories, including our Play Plex mobile apps to the domestic marketplace.", "Third, balance sheet. As I've said before, we remain committed to maintaining Viacom's investment-grade rating. To this end, we recently took significant steps toward strengthening our balance sheet, improving our leverage profile and enhancing liquidity. This included consummating a $1.3 billion hybrid debt deal, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $1.4 billion of our near-term maturities; and the April announcement of the sale of our 49.8% stake in EPIX to MGM for $634 million, which we anticipate to close shortly and whose proceeds will be used to retire further debt obligations.", "And we moved forward with our slate financing agreement with our partners in China, which Wade will speak to later. Combined, these moves will strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and give us greater flexibility as we move forward.", "Fourth, execution. Increasingly, this is what it's all about, executing. Let me share with you a few highlights from the quarter. First, MTV. Chris McCarthy and his team have been very busy behind the scenes. And I'm pleased to say that they're approaching the completion of their first phase of work, putting in place a new team, strengthening the schedules and introducing a new programming pipeline with renewed focus on unscripted content. This has already created some value.", "What I'm most excited about is the second phase of work, bringing the team's hard work to the screens, to audiences. Starting this month and rolling out throughout the summer, this includes new content, new talent and return of daily live programming to the network. The first show to hit this month, a revamped and broadened MTV Movie and TV Awards airs Sunday, then a week later comes the new Promposal which is just what it sounds like, young people making pretty amazing proposals to take their intended dates to the prom. A new version of My Super Sweet 16 accompanies it. Then a reimagined Fear Factor, hosted by Ludacris, follows two weeks later and all of this is just the beginning.", "There are eight new shows in the month. As part of this, we've also initiated a major expansion of our Times Square studio, best known as the TRL Studio, to power this drive into live. This will fuel a live afternoon programming block that will provide a critical on-ramp to MTV's primetime block. And by next fiscal year, the network expects to program nearly 50% more content powers. Additionally, it's pushing quickly into live experiences, including a free three-hour preshow festival for audiences to amplify the Movie and TV Awards this weekend.", "Second, Paramount TV production, a real and untold success story. It launched in 2014 with the goal to create and deliver cinematic filmmaker-driven SVOD and premium cable content. Today, the studio has far exceeded its initial target of two dramas and one comedy on air in three years. They currently have the critically acclaimed series 13 Reasons Why now streaming on Netflix. It's already the most tweeted-about show of 2017.", "They have renewals in the form of second seasons currently shooting on Berlin Station and Shooter and a third season of School of Rock with Nickelodeon and season three and four of the Bajillion Dollar Propertie$ on Seeso. And they are currently in production on the best-selling novel The Alienist for TNT and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, starring John Krasinski, for Amazon.", "This summer they begin shooting Maniac with Cary Fukunaga, Emma Stone and Jonah Hill and in the fall, The Haunting with Steven Spielberg's Amblin TV for Netflix. Paramount TV already has strong relationships with the top creators and producers on and off screen and has been recognized for its work with 10 nominations and 5 Emmy Awards with the breakthrough hit for Grease: Live.", "Having a successful TV production business attached to the studio provides helpful consistency in cash flows, and I believe it is fundamental to the success of the studio. And let's not forget that this is a low capital-intensive business. We see considerable value here going forward.", "Third, ad sales. Right now, we are several weeks into upfront conversations with our marketing partners. And I, along with our flagship brand leaders, sales and data executives have been meeting with agencies and clients to unveil new brand strategies and content and to discuss new ways of working together. Along the way, we've regularly heard from marketers about the need for consistency in audience targeting and measurement for advanced TV advertising. That's why we're so excited to unveil Open AP with our partners at Fox and Turner in March, creating the industry's first open platform for cross-publisher audience targeting and independent measurement, which builds on the success we've had with Vantage, our data-driven advanced audience platform.", "We believe Open AP represents a considerable opportunity for programmers, agencies and advertisers and we're pleased to say that, from early positive feedback, they agree. While it's early days, I'm optimistic about this year's upfront and believe that both television and Viacom are well positioned. More on that next quarter.", "Fourth, distribution. Here, we continue to move beyond one-note conversations on carriage to comprehensive discussions on how we can build more value for all parties while sustainably supporting and evolving the pay-TV ecosystem and we are not waiting until renewals to engage.", "In fact, we are currently actively engaged with a number of parties all outside the traditional renewal discussions. Here, there are two things worth mentioning. First, we now have data and advertising pilots operational with two major U.S. MVPDs, whereby we are inserting some advanced advertising campaigns in their local commercial availabilities.", "Second, we are speaking with several MVPDs regarding variations on the entertainment skinny pack concept, and we're optimistic that one could launch by the end of this year. Both of these are early but tangible examples of the implementation of the strategy we first rolled out to you on our last call. And whether it's marketers, distributors or other industry partners, a lot of this simply comes down to being more engaged, more accessible and more transparent. We've been and will continue to be very active on this front as we feel there's enormous potential to create new opportunities.", "Fifth, international. I'm pleased to report that our business outside the U.S. continues to thrive. We are seeing continued strength in audience delivery across the pay portfolio with revenue-weighted share up 4% in the quarter. We also extended the reach of our pay brands in the Middle East with the launch of three new channels, including Paramount.", "At the local level, our latest acquisition, Telefe, continued its dominance as Argentina's monthly ratings leader in every day part this quarter, contributing to our advertising and affiliate growth abroad. And Channel 5 experienced its fifth straight quarter of growth and increased its audience share in key demographics by 4% year-over-year.", "Finally, last month, we announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in Porta dos Fundos in Brazil. We're really excited about this one. The company is a leading short-form comedy content producer creating digital native content for Brazil's number 2 YouTube channel. These are all important moves as we continue to position international as an even bigger contributor to our overall business.", "Lastly, Nickelodeon. Under Cyma Zarghami's leadership, Nick has already built a strong foundation for what we're trying to achieve with all of our flagship brands. It's fully global, fully diversified across consumer products, experiences, theatrical and digital, while consistently dominant on linear.", "With that, I'll hand it over to Cyma, President of the Nickelodeon Group, to share more insights into Nick's progress and priorities moving forward. Cyma?", "Cyma Zarghami", "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob said, Nickelodeon is on very solid ground. This success is the result of several strategic steps that propelled us to number 1 with kids, a position that we've held for three years and counting. And we continue to extend our lead over the competition with year-over-year ratings growth of 5% this quarter.", "Nick has the top kid shows in every genre, thanks to a new generation of shows that kids love, with new hits like The Loud House and more new episodes from SpongeBob, live-action favorites like Henry Danger and a new set of popular preschool programs including PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines, providing diversification across our portfolio.", "At any given time, we have a strong bench of six to eight shows that power the lion's share of our GRPs, which account for 65% of all ad-based kid viewing in the marketplace. It was the strength and diversity of our pipeline that earned the network's top-rated status and ownership of the top 10 shows with kids 2 to 11, kids 6 to 11 and kids 2 to 5.", "So here's a little bit more about how we got here. First, based on findings from an in-depth research study that we conducted, we acknowledged and addressed three key developments in the landscape. A new generation of kids who are very different from those who came before them, even more new platforms and devices like smart TVs, streaming players and more tablets and an altogether different paradigm in entertainment, one that puts a premium on more new content and on-demand viewing.", "So with that as a backdrop, we've rolled out the results of our audience research study to the entire organization. We installed new leadership in every creative group. We cultivated a new roster of Nick talent that reflects the audience. They're smart, relatable and diverse. We redesigned our New York facilities and expanded our West Coast offices in Burbank to ensure that our teams have the best environment to support their creativity. Burbank is the home to our animation production. We have 20 shows currently in production there and more than 600 incredibly talented in-house animators and creators.", "We committed to building franchises from the ground up, which includes making consumer products a part of the development process. We reimagined a marketing approach for our content and brand that is multiplatform and immersive. It's 360 degrees, 365 days a year. And most importantly, we significantly increased our content pipeline. To meet the audiences' demand for more, we created a pipeline for every genre: live-action, animation, preschool, TV movies, live events and new formats like digital and short form.", "For this current season, we have almost 700 episodes of new and returning series with a mix of programming coming from multiple initiatives that allow us to generate more content with only modest increases in production budgets, like co-productions with our international divisions and experiments with new formats. This content delivers results across platforms and geographies.", "The Loud House is reaching SpongeBob-sized ratings in the U.S.A. And in less than a year, globally it's already top 10 in 10 countries. We continue to prioritize growing our owned and operated platforms. For the fiscal year-to-date, we saw 31% increase in full episode streams. Preschool was even stronger, where our episode streams grew 105%. And our preschool content, in particular, is helping power our strong consumer products portfolio. We have more than doubled the number of properties in our preschool portfolio, which helps us generate $4 billion in annual sales at retail.", "PAW Patrol is the number 1 preschool property. It was the number 1 show for kids 2 to 5 this quarter. It was named licensing toy of the year by the Toy Association, and it remains both a hit on TV and in consumer products internationally. Shimmer and Shine is a top 5 preschool show here in the United States, and it's already a top 10 property in 10 countries. And we're also laying the groundwork for the launch next year of an all-new animated series for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The new series is a true reinvention and will energize the fan base across television, games and apps and consumer products.", "Because our strategy is paying off, we feel confident in our performance, and we're now looking to make the Nick brand even bigger and beyond television. Very quickly, here's three initiatives that align with the overall Viacom strategy to move our brands more meaningfully into film, the physical world and the digital world. We're working closely with Paramount to develop IP for the silver screen and for small screen. There will definitely be another SpongeBob movie. We're developing big-screen treatments for Henry Danger and the Loud House, with more to come.", "But the first example of this new collaborative way of working is Amusement Park, an animated film in theaters next summer first and then followed by a TV series. Amusement Park is a great example of the kind of movies that should be Nickelodeon. In the physical world, there's an opportunity with families to take vacations together. So we've launched a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic last year, and we have another one coming next year in Mexico. And our goal is to have a series of these license deals in the coming years.", "Live tours are an important part of our franchise planning. The model right now is a PAW Patrol live tour, which has been selling out here and internationally. We're moving towards multiple tours up and running simultaneously.", "Digital is another opportunity. Games are a successful extension of our franchises. We have more than 50 apps so far from seven different properties, and more than half of these have hit number 1 at launch. We recently announced the creation of our entertainment lab. It's a technology incubator for experimenting with VR, AR and AI in new, faster ways to develop and create and produce IP.", "So as Nickelodeon keeps moving forward and growing, we'll continue to be laser-focused on cementing our position in the hearts and minds of the next generation of kids and families. We have a clear and growing leadership position in television and a clear path to significantly expand the brand with many, many initiatives already underway.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Wade.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Cyma, and good morning. We're pleased to report our financial results for the March quarter of fiscal 2017. In the quarter, we again saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. We continue to execute on our strategic plan, and we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and de-lever the company.", "Before I take you through our adjusted operating results, I want to note that we took $280 million of restructuring and programming charges in the quarter. These actions are aligned with our new strategic plan, including our move away from scripted product on certain networks, the rebranding of Spike as the Paramount Network and the streamlining and consolidation of certain Media Networks support functions. While some of the savings from these actions will fall to the bottom line, the majority of the savings will be reinvested to fund the execution of our strategic plan.", "Now let's take a look at our operating results. In terms of consolidated results, we saw growth across a number of key metrics in the quarter. Viacom generated revenue of $3.3 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year. And adjusted operating income of $612 million, which was up 4%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.79, an increase of 4% over the prior year. And year-to-date, we've generated $343 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 49% over last year. Our top line growth was driven by strong performance across all Filmed Entertainment revenue streams, increases in affiliate revenue and continued strength at our international Media Networks. Slide 4 of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment.", "Revenues for the quarter increased by 1% to $2.4 billion. Revenues included a 1 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 2%, while advertising revenues declined 1% and ancillary revenues were flat. Adjusted operating income declined to $747 million.", "Slide 5 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks' domestic and international revenue performance.", "Domestic revenues decreased 2% to $1.9 billion, and we had another strong quarter at our international operations as revenues increased by 11% to $478 million. On an organic basis, if we exclude a 7 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact and 10 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue grew 8%.", "At our domestic Media Networks business, we continue to see growth in affiliate with revenues up 1% in the quarter. The growth reflects rate increases, partially offset by a modest decline in pay-TV subscribers as well as the decline in revenues from SVOD agreements. Domestic advertising declined 4% in the quarter, consistent with our guidance from the last earnings call. The performance in the quarter reflects the timing of the Easter holiday, which had an unfavourable impact of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, domestic ad sales performance was in line with the December quarter. Strong pricing increases were more than offset by lower impressions.", "International advertising revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Organically, if we exclude an 11 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign currency and a 17 percentage point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe, international advertising revenues grew 5%, reflecting continued strength in Europe.", "International affiliate revenues increased 10%, which included a 4 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign currency and a 4 percentage point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe. The growth in the quarter reflects the impact of rate increases, subscriber growth and new channel launches as well as higher revenues from SVOD and OTT agreements.", "Internationally, ancillary revenues were up 11% due primarily to growth in consumer products, driven by the strength of our kids brands, including PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines as well as growth in TV licensing. Currency has had an immaterial impact on ancillary revenues.", "Worldwide expenses increased 5% in the quarter and reflect an unfavourable 3 percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe and a favourable 1 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. Excluding these items, organic growth in worldwide expenses was 3%.", "Within operating expenses, programming expense was flat due to the timing of programming premieres aired in the quarter. SG&A expense increased 11% in the quarter due to higher advertising and promotion cost and the acquisition of Telefe. Distribution and other expenses increased 9%, which included the impact of Telefe.", "Overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making at Media Networks. We're moving quickly to implement our flagship brand strategy, and we expect to see the benefits of this strategy and a strengthened portfolio as we progress through the year.", "Turning to Paramount. The slate financing agreement that we entered into last December remains on track and is in operation. Additionally, the partners have elected to upsize their commitment from 25% to 30%. As previously announced, this is a three-year agreement with an option to extend to a fourth and covers films beginning with our fiscal 2017 slate.", "Now turning to the studio's results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 37%, driven by gains across all revenue streams. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues increased 10% to $238 million, primarily due to the release of xXx: Return of Xander Cage, partially offset by lower carryover revenues. Home entertainment revenues increased 29% to $198 million, primarily reflecting the number and mix of current quarter releases, including Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Arrival, Allied and Fences.", "Licensing revenues increased 45% to $347 million, primarily driven by Paramount Television productions, including 13 Reasons Why and Shooter as well as higher revenues from pay-TV and SVOD distributors.", "Ancillary revenues increased 149% to $112 million, primarily driven by the impact of the film slate financing in the quarter. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $66 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $136 million in the prior year, an improvement of $70 million. The improvement reflects the gains in revenue, partially offset by higher print and advertising expenses related to our fiscal 2017 theatrical releases.", "In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 30.5% as compared to 32.8% in the prior year, driven by the mix of domestic and international income.", "Slide 11 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. Year-to-date, we generated $343 million of operating free cash flow, which is a 49% improvement versus last year. The increase in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower working capital utilization, reflecting lower film spend.", "Looking at our debt on Slide 10. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end at 4.8%. We had $12.2 billion of total debt and $671 million of cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. During the quarter, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and de-lever the company. In February, we issued a total of $1.3 billion of hybrid securities, which received partial equity credit from the ratings agencies. In March, we used those proceeds to redeem $1.4 billion of our near-term maturities. If you take into consideration the equity credit we received on hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter-end was $11.5 billion.", "In April, we announced the sale of our 49.8% stake in EPIX to MGM for $634 million, inclusive of dividends. We anticipate that the transaction will close this quarter, and we'll use the net after-tax proceeds of approximately $570 million to redeem outstanding debt. Pro forma to the sale of EPIX, our adjusted gross debt at March 31 would have been $11 billion.", "Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9 and our commitment to delevering, if you take the EPIX sale into account, we reduced gross debt by $1.3 billion or approximately 10%.", "We continue to be focused on strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our capital structure to support our long-term strategic objective. And we are focused on preserving our investment-grade rating by monetizing non-core assets enhancing our cash flow as well as taking other actions that will allow us to achieve our stated objectives.", "Now let's turn to some of the factors impacting the second half of fiscal 2017. For the June quarter, we expect continued improvement in worldwide ad sales driven by ongoing double-digit growth in international, offset by declines in domestic advertising in the low single digits, reflecting sequential improvement from the March quarter.", "As for affiliate revenues in the June quarter, we expect that both domestic and international revenue will continue to grow with worldwide revenues showing sequential improvement from the March quarter. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming spend will be in mid-single digits, including factoring in the impact of the acquisition of Telefe.", "Fences will modestly benefit from our restructuring actions. For the full year, on an organic basis, we expect Media Networks SG&A expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, recorded SG&A expense will grow in the high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%.", "We'll continue to prime this as we go through the year and get a better sense for the domestic versus international profitability mix.", "With that, I'd like to turn it back to Bob to wrap it up.", "Robert Bakish", "Thank you, Wade. In closing, we will continue to move fast, be aggressive and be opportunistic in driving the turnaround for Viacom. Our goal is to evolve Viacom into the premier portfolio of global multiplatform entertainment brand. As we stay focused and flexible and become a partner of choice in our industry, we know that goal is well within our grasp. And as we do, we'll remain focused on growing earnings, free cash flow and delivering value for our shareholders. I know we spent time with many of you over the past few months, and we will continue to do so moving forward to ensure the dialogue continues.", "Thank you for all your support. We will now take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thanks, good morning. Bob, obviously, there's a lot of concern in the marketplace about the state of the bundle. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the improvement you're expecting in affiliate revenues in the U.S. in particular, your relationships with some of the key MVPDs, particularly Charter, where, I believe, there's been some potential re-tiering.", "And then for you and/or Cyma, just on Nickelodeon. It was interesting. Hulu obviously is not carrying the network. Not a surprise. But they called out Nick's content on demand as a key part of their SVOD offers. Obviously, they see value there. How are you thinking about managing Nick's content distribution given the changing landscape?", "And are there opportunities, you think, for real revenue benefits on that business in the medium term from some of these shifts, maybe touching on your strategy for SVOD with Nick, in general? Thanks.", "Robert Bakish", "Thanks, Ben. A bunch of questions there. But look, there's a lot going on in the industry, for sure. There was recently some data on subs that probably were seeing some softness, too. It is worth noting that, that subscribing data is differentiated by distributor. Some operators actually grew subs while others declined. So while early, it does suggest there's some execution differences going on. But I think that's also - should be a rallying cry for the industry.", "We need to work together to ensure that the product and marketing better support industry performance. We're already engaging in that dialogue with really all of our partners and believe that this will probably be a catalyst for escalating those dialogues. And that, at the end of the day, is a good thing. We also think, among other things, it highlights the need for truly new consumer options. And we do think that this entertainment pack initiative fits perfectly as a low-priced entry point for some of the people that are not currently participating in the ecosystem and may have churn due to price points. So a lot going on there.", "With respect to Charter, in particular, we are aware of the issue. Worth noting, it appears to affect new subs only. It's not a broad re-tiering. I read something today that suggested it might be. But suffice it to say, this is in the context of an ongoing integration there. There is a difference of opinion on what's appropriate. We have a very strong point of view and are in conversations about it and I believe this will get resolved. And again, at a macro level, we continue to be focused on partnership with Charter and where there's other conversations going on and other MVPDs and are working to build and evolve the pay-TV ecosystem.", "On the Nickelodeon front, let me just touch on SVOD in general and then I'll let Cyma add some color to it. So again, we are principally focused on maintaining the value of the pay-TV ecosystem. It's why I made the decision earlier this year not to renew a set of properties with Hulu. That was something they were very interested in, to be clear. And I haven't seen Mike's commentary on that, but it doesn't surprise me because they do continue to have some product.", "We have to make sure, as an industry, that we are not creating inexpensive alternatives for consumers to access our best product. And so that has very much driven our current thinking on SVOD. Clearly, within that framework, there is an opportunity to put some product in SVOD, whether it's U.S. or international. In international, there's also the dimension of country and different markets or in different places with respect to pay-TV penetration and the like. But there are some things that make sense out there. So you can expect we would have some presence, at least on some platforms, but not in a high-volume, fresh kind of way. Cyma, you might want to add to that.", "Cyma Zarghami", "Sure. The product that we have on Hulu right now is primarily a set of our hits that have many seasons and many episodes. And we have our own - we have a deep library of content that fuels our own channels, six of our own platforms. But as we build out our consumer products business and capabilities, it is beneficial to our hits to have them in multiple places and multiple access to the consumers. And when they work, they work almost everywhere. And performance on television is not affected at all by that performance on Hulu.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thank you both.", "Wade Davis", "Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Rich Greenfield of BTIG.", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Sort of a followup to the last one, the MVPDs, broadly, the facilities-based ones, they've struggled to create kind of more flexible bundles. They've got all of these legacy minimum distribution clauses that makes it hard to create bundles without broadcasters or without sports. But from what we can tell, it looks like they have a lot more flexibility.", "They want to create so-called virtual MVPDs or over-the-top bundles where they could actually launch bundles that don't have some of the legacy sports and broadcast channels. When you talk, Bob, about kind of new skinny bundles, are these the type of things - I mean, we sense Charter has been working on one of these kind of sports-less bundles. Rutledge has been pretty outspoken about the need for lower-cost bundles. AT&T's Stephenson's done the same. Just curious, like, is that the type of thing that you think could happen from existing distributors over the course of this year?", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. Thanks, Rich. So we're not privy to everyone's contracts on a specific level, clearly. But your general characterization, we would agree with. We do believe there are opportunities to create these skinnier bundles. And we're in very deep conversation with one particular entity right now about exactly that. And we do believe that, as we get a breakthrough here that will be a catalyst for more. Because look, at the end of the day, when you talk to people running these distribution companies, and I have met with the CEO of every one of them, everyone acknowledges that there's a marketplace opportunity here. And that's certainly based on their own data, which we haven't seen.", "It's based on international data where things exist. No one questions the opportunity. And again, I think, given what's going on in some of the - with the recent universe figures, it increases the need to provide alternative packaging options to consumers to bring them into the ecosystem. So yeah, I think there is a path where someone will create a structure that allows this to come to market, again, that's something we're working on.", "By the way, that probably or potentially includes the fact that broadcast signals are accessible via antennas and that offering is integrated in. So there are things going on here. There's a little bit of complexity, but we continue to be in a lot of conversations. And I'm quite confident that we're going to get somewhere.", "Richard Greenfield", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you. Could you provide a bit more color on what you're currently seeing in the domestic ad market, how pricing is trending? And I know you mentioned we should expect some sequential improvement in the June quarter. Is that excluding the Easter - the benefit of the Easter shift?", "And then just a followup on the Paramount TV Studio. When you see such success as you have with 13 Reasons Why, I guess, could you just give us some color about how that may sort of maybe have an indirect benefit to the studio and your efforts there to put you more on the map? I guess, any color on that would be great.", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. So again, a bunch of questions there. Nice to hear from you, Alexia. On the ad market, look, we're feeling good about it. And as I indicated, we've been -- and I've personally been in a lot of conversations with the people running all the major agencies as part of a new approach to the upfront we're initiating this year, where instead of doing a single, very large presentation where we kind of broadcast information to 1,000 people, we've been sitting down in a much more intimate, kind of agency-to-agency, in some cases, client-specific setting, where it's not only sales folks, myself, it's our flagship brand presidents and talking to them about what's going on.", "So we have a fair amount of read on the market. I'd say, I'm - we're definitely feeling good about it. There is, in terms of scatter market, some typical free upfront posturing. And I say this having been the Chief Operating Officer of domestic advertising sales in the kind of the first part of the 2000s. So this is not at all uncommon. I would say, big picture, the market is good. Supply is tight. I mean, that's the benefit of some of the other things that are going on. There is noise on digital, without question. And TV is well positioned. So I think the market is pretty good, and it's setting up nicely for the upfront.", "As far as the comps for the June quarter and your question about Easter, Easter is worth about a point to us. It was a -- so if you look at the March quarter and the June quarter, it did -- when we have the minus 4 in the June quarter, it is equivalent to minus 3 when you adjust for Easter. So if that's your question, that's the answer. As far as Paramount goes, they're - as I said in my formal remarks, there's a lot of great stuff going on at Paramount on the television production side. It really is a great time to be in the television production business.", "There is a lot of demand. And kind of one of the unique things that we have is, at Paramount, we have a deep library of stories that we're drawing on, some of them only relate to films that have been brought to market, some of them aren't. And we're really - it's early days, but we are having some great success in converting that into episodic television in a very financially attractive way to us. So I feel good about 13 Reasons. Why?", "It's clearly - like I said, it's the most tweeted-about show in 2017. There's a lot of discussion on it. Wait, it is a tough topic, and there's also discussions in school. I also want to point out that it is a TV mature-rated product. It's not for young children. But it's created a lot of interest. And it's probably something that has the potential to continue. Again, we haven't announced anything on that. But does that answer your question? Or you have anything else specifically on television production?", "Alexia Quadrani", "No, that's very helpful. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Doug Mitchelson of UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks, so much. Bob, you've already started to talk about shifts in your relationships with distributors and strategies with distributors. There's still a lot of concern for Viacom on affiliate revenue growth and the cadence. And you've talked about providing more flexibility to distributors, and a lot of investors think that means less distribution for some of your networks, which means less affiliate revenue, less ad revenue. Can you square that up? Is giving distributors more flexibility the equivalent of less affiliate revenue for Viacom?", "Robert Bakish", "So we've talked about not flexibility, per se, but broadening the partnership discussion. And what we mean by that specifically is, historically, our discussions were almost exclusively at renewal points and almost exclusively about - and really they were exclusively about carriage of linear fees and how much on-demand product was going to go along with that. Today, and again, we're in arranged conversations with very large MVPDs, kind of as we speak, the conversation is happening when there isn't a deal up, point one.", "Point two is, it is including other topics that can provide value from Viacom to distributors. I mentioned in my remarks about these two data pilots we have going on where we're literally inserting Vantage campaigns in local avails and having MSOs benefit financially from that. Now clearly, that's early days, but I'm actually very happy to have two of those up and running already. So that's good news.", "As far as carriage of networks goes, you can think of our networks come in 3 flat - 3 tiers, if you will. You have the flagships, which we talked about. You have another set of broadly distributed networks, MTV, VH1 and TV Land, which all have up ratings in the last quarter. They're doing very well. All have strong consumer franchises.", "And then you have a set of, what we call, digital or suite services. The conversations that we had on that last category, historically was all about we want more distribution, more distribution. And really, that causes problems because they want services in tiers, et cetera. So we moved off that conversation. We're fine having those up there for hierarchy clients.", "Our principal focus is ensuring ongoing broad distribution of - in our flagships and this other widely distributed tier. And we're missing that carriage in some places, and we're in conversations about hopefully getting that back. But it's not about a notion of being totally flexible per se to carry anything you want.", "It is very much also about what Rich was talking about before, which is finding the catalyst for the entry point for this entertainment pack, because if you think about it, pay-TV has gotten very expensive. You're talking $100-plus ARPUs in a world where people have to pay for cellphones and the like and there's a lot of stress on that machine.", "We fundamentally believe that a lower-price option will be pretty compelling to people. And again, so there's a lot of conversation about that. Now clearly, that doesn't involve all of our services. It would involve the suite services, at least at the most basic, widely distributed tier, maybe as an option for other tiers. But the principal opportunity is on widely distributed service.", "And if you think about the Viacom brand in this, remember, we have the #1 preschool brand in the world with Nick Jr. Full Stop, the only kids channel Nickelodeon. Full stop. If MTV, which has had its bumps in the road, but I'm telling you, and I would encourage you to ask an advertising agency that have been in our upfront dinners, there's a lot of excitement coming, whether it's Promposal, [indiscernible] or the return of TRL, this thing is going somewhere.", "And by the way, it's going somewhere in a not just linear way, all of these properties have, let's just call it, deep integration with non-television devices. In fact, the Promposal, we sourced hundreds of thousands of ideas off the Internet very quickly. So it's an integrated strategy. On the Comedy Central, the biggest problem with Comedy Central ratings in the last 18 months has been the transition of our late-night franchise.", "John and Steve have gone away. Trevor is starting to hit his stride, and we got Jordan coming in the fall with a half hour. That's really - that should be the new going-forward block. Jordan's been in a lot of our effort. He has been in lot of our upfront dinners. He's really funny. We have high hopes for that. So Comedy, I believe, it's already highly valued. It's the only brand of its kind in media. And it's on a path to continued improvement. And then you got BET far and away, number 1 in the African-American demographic. It has the biggest share in the market.", "We just did a series of upfront presentations there focusing on what they have coming up in some - in their late-night blocks, the comedy stuff, et cetera, it looks very strong. And finally, Paramount. That's a big story for us. So you think of just those six services, that's preschool to adults, including film, that's a killer block and a killer cornerstone at a really, potentially very attractive price point. So look, we got - we're working hard to work with our partners to evolve this business, but we fundamentally see opportunity here. And we're very focused on unlocking it.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks, so much, Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "So there's one other thing that I would say, just because in the context of Viacom, and I know there's a lot of noise on this distribution point and I get it. But really you should focus on the broad range of opportunity that we're going at our company. There is distribution to recapture, and that's valuable to us.", "There is viewing share to grow, and we have a clear path to that. There is upside in domestic advertising. And that's on - based on growing our viewing share, that's based on pricing opportunity, particularly in the Spike to Paramount transition. That's based on growing our yield by continuing down the data-driven advertising path, something we're continuing to drive the industry on.", "There is international, additional international opportunity, and you see we have nice momentum there and there's no question that Paramount will turn. And as we're doing that, we're building a very nice television production business to go with it, which is key to having a valuable, sustainable studio.", "And then finally, there's real greenfield opportunities in digital where we have very small share, and there's obviously a lot of time spent viewing. And beyond media, what Cyma talked about, what we're doing in the hotel space, now Comedy Central, MTV are doing experiential stuff. Nickelodeon is coming next year with experiential stuff. There's a lot of opportunity there. So there's no question there's growth for Viacom as we navigate this changing world.", "Doug Mitchelson", "I appreciate all the color Bob.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Janedis of Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Thank you. Cyma, could you talk more about how advertisers are thinking about reaching the kids in the younger demo? Is it a shift away from the TV screen? How does the toy money look broadly in? And will the original hours at Nick need to increase annually going forward, given the competition? ", "Cyma Zarghami", "Sure. We have a bunch of categories that are consistent across our business, right? Obviously, toys, obviously the movie studios and the market looks good at the moment. So we're very optimistic with our share being up and the large sort of percentage of the share that we have in the ad market at the moment.", "And I think that the advantage to Nickelodeon and all of the ecosystem that we have built is that we are able to reach kids with mass simultaneous viewing opportunities that you really can't get anywhere else. And I think that is really one of our advantages. That, and the fact that we have an incredible stable -- an incredibly stable position at the moment and a clear path to some consistency with some real hits in the market. So we're feeling very optimistic about our position and the growth of our ecosystem, particularly on the Nick app and the Nick Jr. app.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. And I'd just add to that, really, kind of echo it. If you look at Nickelodeon, where it's come over the last couple of years, you could argue, two, three years ago, it was the SpongeBob network. And Cyma and her team took that as a serious challenge a couple of years ago and built this multi-genre, multi-demographic pipeline that you're seeing coming to fruition today, and among other things, delivering 10 of the top 10 shows on kids television and having those new franchises working today.", "And the top 3, by the way, aren't SpongeBob. It depends on which demographic you look at and you can get deeper than that. So that's something that you can't build overnight. And as we've been seeing the benefit of that, our share lead versus our traditional competitors of Disney and Cartoon has actually grown. And so that's momentum that I'm highly confident will continue going forward.", "And when you talk about advertising, you talk about supply and demand, right? So the supply is tight, and we have a larger share than we're used to. That's a great place to be going into a selling cycle. And the demand is strong, too, because you've got a couple of key categories, and Cyma referenced them, toys, films and QSR, among others, that are also in good shape. So you put that together, that feels pretty good in the context of Nickelodeon in this upfront and having a really sustainable position in the marketplace.", "Wade Davis", "Last thing I'd add with respect to that kid's ad market is that the characteristics around digital and the restrictions around digital for the kid's ad markets reduce the number of alternatives that are available for advertisers who want to reach children. And so it just further creates a dynamic in which Nickelodeon is must-buy for anybody who wants to reach kids.", "Robert Bakish", "By the way, the other thing I would say on Nick, which I think is interesting, and it goes probably to an underlying question you have in terms of, \"Do you have to produce more stuff?\" In the last two years, the other thing that's happened is, Nickelodeon has moved to sourcing ideas globally, not just from the U.S. And in fact, as proven, that you can have hits that come from outside the U.S.", "And that's very important because, a, it gets you a wider footprint of creative ideas. And b, the economics of those ideas are substantially superior to U.S.-produced ideas. So you are getting very high quality at a more attractive price point, which, on a total mix basis, helps manage your spending as you -- in this time, we've ramped episode. And again, we're in a very unique position of being able to that given our assets.", "John Janedis", "That's helpful, thanks. And may be if I can sneak one in for Wade. Thanks for the update on the China slate financing. As you know, there's been a lot of noise and headlines around the payment. So is the takeaway that given the upsize commitment, that the funding concerns shouldn't be an issue and that payment is on track? And does the 30% mean that there's upside to the initial $1 billion?", "Wade Davis", "Yes. So despite everything that's written, we've never really had concerns about payment. There is a payment schedule in the agreement, and we're going to receive cash this quarter per the schedule that was always in the agreement. And in terms of upside, yes, there is upside too from the 25% to the 30%, given that, as I said in my remarks, the deal in the aggregate still pertains to all films released in 2017. And so to the extent that there's 30%, that's upsized from what we've been incorporating into our financial statements to date.", "John Janedis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Wade. Bob, now that you have time to take some cost actions, review programming schedules, look at the global footprint of the company, can you share expectations for cost growth over, let's say, the midterm, between programming and non-programming cost? And what's the right way to think about those two buckets?", "Robert Bakish", "Yeah. Look, we've done a lot of work over the past six months or so, including a restructuring. We're not giving guidance at this point on specific elements of the P&L. What Wade said about the restructuring is worth echoing, which is, yes, there are savings in the restructuring. And some of those savings will drop to the bottom line, but they're also really a funding mechanism as we continue to strengthen our company and that's both with respect to programming, but more specifically, with respect to expanding into places where we don't have significant participation today.", "So we talked about setting up the digital business unit, which we're currently working on and building out some offerings there. So this is about - and I think a lot of this is story of Viacom, it's we're remixing. When you looked at - if you look at the brands - for the domestic brands, the pay-TV business, you're seeing our expense base getting remixed within brands.", "So the context of MTV, where we're shifting our mix to be much more back towards unscripted, back to mix change that has economic implications that allows the production of more hours at same price point, for example, we're shifting the mix of spending across brands. So an example of that would be shifting spending to the Paramount Network as we re-brand Spike and do that in January and March.", "And we've started with advertisers about - talking about programming that's coming. It represents a substantial investment on a single network basis, but it's being funded as a remix. So that's how you should really be thinking about it. I don't know, Wade, if you want to add anything to that.", "Wade Davis", "Yeah, it's really - I mean, it's funding investments in future growth, right? I mean, when we rolled out our strategy, we did get a lot of questions specifically around digital and live events as to whether or not people should think of us needing to invest significant new dollars in executing against those initiatives and the answer is no. We are taking efficiencies that we've been able to extract from other parts of the organization and have been able to reinvest the majority of those savings into initiatives that are going to generate growth in the future.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. And then Wade, can you just follow up on the slate financial question? So far, first half of the year, you've seen the benefit at the studio and the ancillary line. Does that continue for the rest of the year or it - was that a first half kind of catch-up due to the slate financing?", "Wade Davis", "There will continue to be impact in fiscal '17. And depending on how we elect to structure certain elements of the forward slates, there may be -- there may or may not be impact in the forward years.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. Thank you.", "Wade Davis", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "We'll go to Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Thanks. I have two questions. First, I just wanted to go back to the advertising topic. Given the ramp-up in programming, particularly over the summer, can you talk about how you're approaching the upfront market, which takes place before a lot of its original programming takes place? And over what period of time do you expect the new consortium, the Open AP, to really have a significant impact?", "And on a completely different topic, on the film group, should we expect more restructuring charges as Jim Gianopulos comes in and brings in his own team? And is there anything, in your view, that he can do to fix the existing slate while his develops over the next, say, 18 to 24 months? If he develops his own slate, what can he do with the existing slate?", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. Thanks, Jessica. So in terms of the programming path and how that fits with the upfront, we have very much been talking about, as you'd expect we would, I just think it's more significant given what's going on, about our going forward programming with all the agencies- we did a studio tour, as an example, to all the studios, showcasing the new MTV, showcasing the Paramount Network. So yes, that is very much part of our upfront process and will be part of our upfront transaction.", "For example, we're in conversations with advertisers about unique opportunities to participate potentially in creative ways on the relaunch or the rebrand to the Paramount Network. And there's some interest there. Absolutely, that's part of the dialogue. And certainly, we see this clear path to MTV ratings improvement. That's going to be part of the economics, if you will. In the context of Open AP, actually, I'll flip that to Wade because he's deeply involved in it and will probably give you the more precise answer.", "Wade Davis", "Yes. But I think your specific question is the timing of the impact -- timing and significance of the impact of Open AP. So as you probably know, that Open AP is not yet available. It won't be available until the beginning of the broadcast year. And over the course -- between now and then, we're going to continue to build participation in that. The enrolment period is open through the end of June. I guess, as of the beginning of next week, we will have met with every major network. And based on those meetings, we expect to significantly expand participation in the initiative.", "In terms of the impact that we - the magnitude of the impact that we expect it to have, even though it's not currently available, in the upfront, we're seeing Open AP as a significant factor driving interest and scale around audience-based buying. And I think, probably, it's important to point out that this is something - Open AP is something that we've done in response to advertiser demand. Advertisers were asking for alignment of process and measurement to enable them to be able to take advantage of some of the advances around next-generation TV advertising, and in particular, audience-based buying.", "So the fact that we're seeing very strong interest materialize in the upfront ahead of any availability from an advertisers' standpoint, which is kind of the actual expression of their early interest that generated the initiative, and the fact that we're seeing strong interest from other networks in participating in the initiative, all cause us to continue to be very optimistic about what Open AP is going to enable for us and the rest of the industry.", "Robert Bakish", "And then moving to Paramount, Jim, here's a couple of things. One is it goes to the execution point. There's a lot of things you have to do once you have a film so you got to distribute it. You got to market it. You have to drive ancillary value, other window values, sales, et cetera. So there's a bunch of stuff that he will certainly - and is already working on improving execution that will create value and then on the films themselves, they're not all made yet.", "So even though you have a slate and you have films in production, you do screenings, you fine-tune them. And he will certainly participate in that process. So I think we will feel - I know we will feel Jim's impact. I already have. And by the way, the employees on the lot also feel and they're very excited about it. So you'll see that value begin to feather in.", "Wade Davis", "I would just add, more specifically, in terms of what impact we expect to see Jim to deliver on the 2018 slate. I mean, I've been extraordinarily impressed on how fast he's hit the ground running and how he's really rallied the existing team and brought in select new talent. We brought in a very senior person in television licensing. But as said, you asked the question about, \"Is he going to bring in his own new team on a wholesale basis?\" And one of the things I've been most impressed is how he has come in and immediately improved and refined certain processes that needed to be improved.", "But almost most importantly, he's really jump-started the culture there and engaged the existing team in ways that are really impressive to see. And in terms of how that's likely to manifest itself, if your question about his ability to impact the '18 slate, I mean, obviously, some of the films have been made, but not all of them.", "As it relates to the films that have been made, he's been very, very specific and targeted around things that he can do to improve the expected performance of those films by looking at refining the release strategy. I think, based on some of the things that he's focused on, there's significant upside in the marketing and releasing costs in certain of those films.", "And it's also really important to remember that Jim's roots are in international. And as the international market becomes more important overall, that that's something that Jim is bringing increased focus and perspectives on. So all those things are examples of things that we expect to have a positive impact on '18 despite the fact that, as you point out, many, but not all, of the films have been made.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. And the other thing, and maybe this is obvious, but he's really in it. He's not letting this thing fly on autopilot. He's in all facets of it, and he brings deep expertise and knowledge to the table across many, many areas. So we're very optimistic about the studio under Jim's leadership.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Right. And then just one - that was an amazing outlook, really great answer. I mean very - that's a lot of color. But the last question, should we expect any more restructuring charges from Film in the next quarter?", "Wade Davis", "There may be some additional restructuring charges, but they'll be very modest. So a lot of times when people see a new studio has come in, they're afraid, to your first question, that they're going to disrupt the team and the operational continuity, but also that they're just going to kind of flush a bunch of the product that they didn't have their name on. And Jim doesn't bring kind of a lot of ego to that question. He's very objective in looking at the product that he thinks is going to work and how to optimize that product from an economic point of view.", "So either that's translated into kind of a very practical and targeted approach that is not - we don't anticipate anything significant. There may be - really, to the extent that there's any write-offs, they're largely going to be on projects that are in kind of a earlier, mid-stage development that Jim doesn't see the kind of potential for to actually make in the movies.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Great, thank you.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us for our earnings call.", "Operator", "That does conclude our conference for today.

(NASDAQ:VIAB) Q3 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call August  3, 2017  4:30 PM ET", "Executives", "James Bombassei - SVP, IR", "Robert Bakish - President and CEO", "Wade Davis - CFO", "Analysts", "John Janedis - Jefferies", "Doug Mitchelson - UBS", "Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan", "Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson", "Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC", "Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Teleconference. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our June quarter earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.", "I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC.", "Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed in this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, we were hard at work executing against the strategy we presented six months ago to revitalize our core business and I'm pleased to say that we've made considerable progress.", "We're seeing real green shoots across our brands and our business and meaningful improvement in our balance sheet. I'll speak to this progress after taking you through our high-level numbers, which Wade will subsequently discussed in depth.", "From a financial perspective, performance in the third quarter continued to show improvement with overall revenues up 8%. An increase in affiliate revenues and sequential improvement in advertising performance contributed to solid results. We've also seen gains across all Filmed Entertainment business lines and continued revenue growth in the international business.", "Media Networks operating income held steady and Filmed Entertainment operating income return to growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2015. This performance drove double-digit increases in adjusted net earnings and EPS for the quarter, up 12% and 11%, respectively.", "At the same time, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet. In addition to the sale of our interest in EPIX, we took the proceeds and cash on hand to redeem over $1 billion of outstanding debt, continuing to demonstrate our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and making us stronger and more flexible for the future.", "Now, moving to the heart of Viacom; our brands. We are making clear progress in our strategy to revitalize our brands, particularly the flagship six, and accelerate Viacom's evolution into the leading global multiplatform branded entertainment company.", "To that end, we're seeing improvement across our portfolio and across every platform. Ratings is understandably one of my main areas of focus and I've seen a marked change in the numbers over the past few months as a result of the actions we've taken.", "They've done what was a sea of red towards increasingly a sea of green, particularly when it comes to share with revenue weighted live same-day share up 4% in the quarter across the entire portfolio. And in an environment where most stable groups saw ratings declines, our C3 ratings were up 1% year-over-year and I'm happy to say this momentum continued through July.", "Bright spots include MTV, which is really starting to gain traction and which I'll talk more about in a moment. BET, the brand had its strongest June year-over-year ratings growth in four years and July was the network's second consecutive month of year-over-year growth.", "Nick remains the number one rated kids network by far, dominating with nine of the top 10 shows for kids six to 11 and four of the top five shows for kids two to five. At comedy, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah achieved its highest-rated and most-watched quarter ever.", "VH1 has had eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth, the longest active streak among major entertainment networks. And CMP and TV Land have all been performing very well and generating positive ratings growth.", "This momentum is true internationally too, where last quarter's revenue weighted share for women's portfolio increased 6% with growth across each and every one of our paid brands as well as at Channel 5 and Telefe.", "Now, I'd like to briefly highlight efforts at MTV, which, as I mentioned, is seeing strong early results, reflecting the relentless work by the team to implement their new strategy. After five years of declining ratings, this June, MTV achieved a 3% increase in ratings and a 14% increase in share, marking the first June year-over-year ratings increase since 2011 and July was even stronger.", "Last month saw a 19% increase in share and a 12% year-over-year ratings increase, the first double-digit increase in four years. And MTV got back into the top five cable networks in prime time for viewers 18 to 34. And this doesn't even reflect the strong performance of Siesta Key, which debuted this week and was MTV's second-highest rated series premiere in the last two years after Fear Factor, which debuted in May.", "And the new content the team is bringing to air is much more cost-effective, freeing up resources to invest in more programming. As we look to fiscal 2018, MTV will have 60% more original hours versus 2017 and it will actually spend less. That includes more live programming, which bridges linear and digital platforms, and there's no better example of this than the new TRL, which will program as many minutes per day for social platforms as it does for linear when it launches on October 2nd.", "So, what you've seen to-date is just the beginning as a bigger, truly multiplatform MTV is coming, when it will complement its clear and growing linear momentum with much more digital activity like the recent hit reboot of Cribs on Snapchat or our industry-first 1 million followers status on Musical.ly; and in 2018, a bigger focus on live events and expanding into feature films.", "And speaking of live events, I'm happy to say that we continue to make progress on the ground across the portfolio, creating and executing experiences that engage our fans in the real world.", "Fiscal year-to-date, we've had 1.5 million people on the ground at our events, a number that will continue to grow. To name just a few, the inaugural Comedy Central Colossal Clusterfest attracted more than 40,000 attendees to rave reviews. And this year's BET experience had 165,000 fans on the ground.", "Internationally, more than 50,000 people took part in our I love MTV Malta music event. And here in New York, Spike's BELLATOR came to Madison Square Garden, the world's most famous arena.", "Moving to the studio side, the business, of course, will take time to turn around, but we are seeing improvement in 2017. While Transformers: The Last Knight didn't perform to expectations, there were certainly points of strength. It was the number one domestic film on its opening weekend and internationally, it's opened number one in 53 markets to-date.", "But the more important point is that the revitalization of Paramount is well underway as we fill out Executive leadership at the studio. We're especially excited about the launch of Paramount Players, the home of our branded and lower budget films and the appointment of a Brian Robbins to lead it. He's the perfect Executive to attract fresh new talent and help connect our brand to the big screen and he's already hard at work.", "We're also very excited about the appointment of Mireille Soria who joined as our new Animation Head in July. She was previously Co-President of Feature Animation at DreamWorks Animation, and we're looking forward to her making her mark at Paramount.", "Lastly, and representative of our brand's unique multiplatform orientation, we couldn't be more excited about the landmark talent deal we did this quarter, a first of its kind cross-portfolio deal with Tyler Perry, spanning TV, film, short form and digital. This is the -- exactly the kind of cross-house deal we want to do, partnering with the best, most versatile talent in the film industry who can work flexibly across our brand and platforms to bring great content to our audiences. This is also a part of our plan to take BET to the next level.", "Moving from brands to the business. Last quarter, we made swift progress with our renewed partnership focus with an emphasis on putting the full power of Viacom to work for our partners, using our points of strength, our brands, our extensive largely on content offering, our data and advanced advertising capabilities, our marketing power, and our global footprint to help us succeed together.", "And this is evident on the advertising side, where we're seeing solid momentum coming out of the U.S. up front, which resulted in volume growth and mid to high single-digit CPM increases across the Board. The changes underway at the brands are making a real difference.", "In particular, advertisers have responded to the new Paramount Network, the revamp direction at MTV, and continued strength at Nickelodeon. They also love the value and dependable delivery at networks like TV Land.", "We continue to find that advertiser will recognize the value of TV quantity advertising, appreciate the controlled premium environment that Viacom can offer, and increasingly, look to our company for innovation including our advanced advertising products.", "And on the distribution side, we announced in May global multiyear agreements with Altice. These agreements extend our Cablevision agreement and reintroduce Viacom networks on Suddenlink starting this month.", "They include a first of its kind partnership to combine Altice's unique audience data, multiplatform measurement, and analytics capabilities with Viacom's advanced advertising expertise to deliver local and national advertising across platforms. It also includes the licensing of Paramount product in France.", "This demonstrates that we're delivering on our commitment to be flexible and creative and that our work on developing and launching new innovative solutions for the benefit of our distribution partners from improved TV Everywhere products, the data-driven advanced advertising solutions is a true differentiator for Viacom.", "As we do this, we're also obviously cognizant of what's going on with the pay-TV universe. We have seen marketplace information on the clients and we've seen it in our numbers, too.", "For us, it reinforces the importance of alignment with our partners. We need to work together to ensure consumers have the best possible pay-TV experience. That means accessing content the way they want it on all devices in linear and on-demand. And it also means providing choice across price points. The ship has sailed on everyone having $100 bundle.", "Many consumers want lower price options including options below $40 and so, we continue to focus on leveraging our unique attributes to be part -- a core part of that offering.", "And I'll say again that low price entertainment packs will be a reality. This will be a critical development in the arc of pay-TV subscriptions and it will be a positive development for Viacom.", "Moving beyond that U.S., this deeper level of partnership and more flexible creative consumer offerings is a big part of our international strategy. Our vast global infrastructure continues to be a real competitive advantage.", "As we capitalize on the various market dynamics to continue growing our pay-TV footprint and, very importantly, experiment with new distribution models. We've launched 12 new channels internationally this fiscal year and have announced that we will launch the Paramount channel in the U.K. in January.", "On the new distribution front, in Japan, the launch of MTV on mobile has transformed our audience reach in that market and now has consumption that surpasses linear viewing.", "We're also working directly with mobile carrier, Telkomsel in Indonesia, to make our branded Nick and Nick Jr. Play Plex apps available to 170 million subscribers as they increasingly migrate to consume data.", "And we've just announced a content development collaboration with iQIYI China's leading OTT video service, which will bring an original Chinese animated series to Nick Asia for the first time following a digital premier on iQIYI's platform.", "In sum, and then stepping back to look at the big picture, while there's still more work to do and industry trends to navigate, we're very pleased with the quick progress we've made to revitalize the business.", "I'll now hand it over to Wade to take you through the numbers.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon. We're pleased to report our financial results for the June quarter of fiscal 2017. In the quarter, we saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment as well as growth in adjusted operating income and operating free cash flow.", "We continue to execute on our strategic plan by extending and broadening our relationships with key distribution partners, evolving our advertising business including leveraging our leadership position and advanced ad -- TV ad products and strengthening our balance sheet.", "During the quarter, we took additional actions to delever including the sale of our stake in EPIX and the completion of our recent tender offer in which we retired over $1 billion of debt.", "Before I go through the adjusted operating results, I want to note that we took $59 million of restructuring and programming charges in the quarter. These actions principally result from new leadership and the implementation of our strategic plan at Paramount.", "In terms of consolidated results, Viacom generated revenue of $3.4 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year and adjusted operating income of $805 million, which was up 5%.", "We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, an increase of 11% over the prior year. And year-to-date, we've generated $548 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 71% over last year.", "Topline growth was driven by growth across all Filmed Entertainment revenue streams as well as an increase in affiliate and advertising revenues at Media Networks. Slide four of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment.", "Revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $2.6 billion. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 4% and advertising revenues increased 2%, while ancillary revenues were down 9%. Adjusted operating income was substantially flat at $870 million.", "Slide five of our web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues were flat at $2 billion, while international revenues increased 8% to $522 million.", "On an organic basis, if we exclude a five percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact and a 14 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenues declined 1% in the quarter.", "At our Media Networks business, domestic affiliate revenues were up 4%, our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The performance in the quarter was due to a timing benefit related to revenues from certain SVOD and OTT agreements, as well as contractual rate increases, partially offset by a decline in subscribers.", "In line with our guidance, domestic advertising in the quarter improved sequentially to decline 2%. This compares to a year-over-year decline of 4% in the March quarter. In the quarter, price increases were more than offset by lower impressions.", "Importantly, however, we made a decision to reduce ad loads in the quarter at a number of our networks in order to improve the viewer experience. If you exclude the impact of these unit load reductions, domestic ad sales would have been up 1% in the quarter.", "The 17% decline in domestic ancillary revenue to $71 million was principally driven by the timing of revenue associated with consumer products arrangement as well as our decision to rest the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise ahead of its relaunch in 2018.", "Now, turning to international. Advertising revenues increased 14% in the quarter. If we exclude a seven percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a 22 percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe, organic international advertising revenue declined 1%. The organic performance reflects growth driven by our global brands offset by softness in the U.K. due to Brexit.", "International affiliate revenues increased 1% including a four percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign currency and a four percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe.", "The growth in the quarter reflects the impact of new channel launches, rate increases and subscriber growth, partially offset by a decline in revenues from SVOD and OTT agreements.", "Worldwide expenses increased 3% in the quarter and reflect an unfavorable three percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe. Within operating expenses, programming expense declined 3% due to timing of programming premieres.", "Distribution and other expense increased 39%, driven principally by higher participations related to the timing of SVOD revenues in the quarter. SG&A expense increased 7% in the quarter due to the acquisition of Telefe as well as higher employee costs.", "Now, turning to the studios results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 36%, driven by increases across all revenue streams. Slide six of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues increased 189% to $263 million, primarily reflecting the performance of our current quarter releases, Transformers: The Last Knight and Baywatch as compared to the performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the June quarter last year.", "Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 14% to $218 million, primarily reflecting catalog distribution revenues. Ancillary revenues increased 61% to $66 million in the quarter.", "Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $9 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $26 million in the prior year, an improvement of $35 million. The improvement was driven by the increase in revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses.", "Now, turning to our co-financing relationships. We just recently extended our successful partnership with David Ellison's Skydance Productions for another four years. The agreement allows for Skydance to co-finance and co-produce certain Paramount properties while giving Paramount the first opportunity to co-finance and distribute all movies Skydance produces.", "As an update on our slate financing deal with our Chinese partners, there's been a delay in our June payment, and as a result, we've made the decision not to book any impact of the deal in the quarter. The deal continues to be in effect and we view HuaHua Media's acquisition by Oriental Time Media we know well as a positive. I would also like to the reiterate that we've been in business with HuaHua for a long time and may have and continue to be a valuable strategic operational and financial partner.", "Now, moving below the line. The increase in equity income primarily reflects the recognition of profits on transaction with EPIX than have been previously deferred. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date effect -- adjusted effective tax rate 30.5% as compared to 32.8% in the prior year, driven by the mix of domestic and international income.", "Slide 11 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. We generated $205 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter, which is 128% improvement versus the prior year.", "Year-to-date, we generated $548 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 71% year-over-year. The increase in operating free cash flow was driven by improvements in working capital at Filmed Entertainment including lower film spend, partially offset by higher cash taxes.", "Turning to leverage, which is detailed on slide 10. Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9th and our commitment to delevering, we have reduced the gross debt by approximately $2 billion or 15%.", "In terms of our debt, at quarter end, it was principally fixed rate with an average cost of 4.9%. We had $11.2 billion of total debt outstanding and $425 million of cash and cash equivalents. If you take into consideration the equity credit we received in our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $10.5 billion.", "During the quarter, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity, and delever the company. In May, we completed the sale of our stake in EPIX for $634 million inclusive of dividends. Net after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately $570 million.", "In June, we used these proceeds as well as cash from operations to redeem over $1 billion of debt. These actions were taken with the goal of supporting our long-term strategic initiatives and maintaining investment-grade metrics. We will continue to explore opportunities to monetize non-core assets, enhance our cash flow, as well as take other actions to achieve our stated objectives.", "Now, let's turn to some of the factors impacting the September quarter of fiscal 2017. In terms of worldwide ad sales, for the September quarter, we expect to see continued sequential improvement. This is driven by ongoing double-digit growth in international, partially offset by a decline in domestic.", "We expect the September quarter domestic ad sales decline to be similar to the June quarter's decline, including a similar impact from our decision to continue to reduce ad loads. We are pleased with the progress we have made to-date in broadening our relationships with our distribution partners and maturing early renewals.", "In terms of the domestic affiliate revenues, given the timing benefit related to SVOD and OTT agreements shifting into the June quarter, we expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline in the low single digits for the September quarter. As for international affiliate revenues, we anticipate continued growth in the September quarter.", "For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks' programming spend will now be in the low to mid-single-digits including the impact of the acquisition from Telefe, partially offset by benefits from our restructuring actions.", "For the full year, on an organic basis, we expect Media Networks' SG&A expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, reported SG&A expense will grow in the high single-digits. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%.", "With that said, I'd like to turn it back over to Bob to wrap it up.", "Robert Bakish", "Thank you, Wade. As I think you've seen, the financials for the quarter reflects an arc of progress across many facets of the business, but they also reflect certain challenges. Some challenges are a result of the time it takes new leadership to realize the benefits of the changes we're making, as in the case of the studio and our distribution relationships.", "But know that we remain highly focused, focused on revitalizing our company and strengthening the performance of our brands including the studio. Some of this is already happening, and we have a clear line of sight to more.", "At the same time, we're actively working to reinvest, to address the shifting landscape, to film new and growing sources of consumer and partner demand both year and all around the world.", "As we do all of this, organic execution is obviously critical. But we will also look broadly including a potential partnership and M&A opportunities to both strengthen our position and accelerate our transition.", "As we assess opportunities, know that we will be rigorous and disciplined that we will be guided by our strategy, our ability to execute, and our overriding commitment to creating shareholder value. This is something that we have successfully accomplished in the past, with Channel 5 in the U.K., Viacom 18 in India, and, more recently, with Telefe in Argentina.", "But to be clear, incremental opportunities may or may not happen. At the core, our overwhelming focus is on organic execution. We continue to see great opportunity at Viacom and the potential for material value creation from the assets we own.", "Thanks for your support. We look forward to continuing the dialogue with you as we move forward. And now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first will come from John Janedis with Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Hi, thank you. Bob, as you know, we've seen some X numbers from your peers from a subscriber perspective. So, what kind of trends are you seeing at the flagship six or core nine compared to the smaller networks? Is your outlook for stabilization? And can you give us an apples-to-apples domestic growth rate ex the extra timing I guess for the current quarter?", "Robert Bakish", "So, there's a bunch of questions in there. Let's talk about the sort of pay-TV environment and some of the decline that's been discussed. So, a couple of pieces. So, the internal data that we have showed a slight degradation from Q2 to Q3, and that data shows a run rate of about minus 3.5%. That's a sad number.", "Now, it's important to note that that data because the internal data based on remits we get from operators that has arrived, so it's incomplete. Now, in general, our internal data tracks with Nielsen in terms of the shape of the curve, i.e. when we're -- when they see improvement, we tend to see it, when there's degradation, they see it.", "So, if you look at the Nielsen data, which runs now from July, that data improved by 0.04 of a percentage point from May to July, so that suggests our data will too and we think the quarter will likely finished once we get through all these remits in the low 3s in terms of decline.", "So, I would characterize that as sort of moderation in the -- versus some of the things that people are talking about. And by the way, our data includes the impact of remits from both MVPDs and VMVPDs because we are seeing some growth from the VMVPD side.", "Wade Davis", "In terms of the question as it relates to the timing shift, if you look at the apples-to-apples third quarter to fourth quarter, if you were to take out and adjust for the shift of the timing of the SVOD agreements, both quarters would have been essentially flat. The growth in -- the majority of the growth in the third quarter and the low single-digit decline in the fourth quarter would have normalized out if we had shifted at that.", "John Janedis", "Okay. And maybe one quick. Given the comments that you made around the China slate financing, can you give us a little more detail on where you are there?", "Wade Davis", "Yes, I mean, as I said in my remarks, the deal is in effect. There was a delay in the June quarter payment and as a result, we decided to not book any impact of the June quarter in our financial statements.", "We've been in business with HuaHua for a long time. They've been a fantastic operating partner in China. They've really moved the needle for us on a number of the pictures that have been highly successful in China. They've been a co-financer -- co-financier for us for years.", "And as I said, we view the transaction that they entered into with OTMC is positive. OTMC is a fantastic company and a company that, frankly, is also well aligned with our Media Networks business in China.", "So, notwithstanding the delay in the June payment, everything's on track. We're happy with our partnership there. We're working with those guys every week and everything is fine.", "Robert Bakish", "Take our next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. That will come from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Thanks so much. A couple of questions as well. Just finishing out on the September quarter affiliate revenue or I guess 3Q and 4Q being flat, if subs are down around 3.5% maybe improving to low 3s in the September quarter, and you're doing flat, I guess the simple math would be your average rate increases are in that same 3%, 3.5%. And I seem to remember a previous commentary that rate annual escalators were more in the mid to high single-digits range, is that right?", "Wade Davis", "Well, for the quarter, the rate increases were around four percentage--.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Sorry, you cut out there.", "Wade Davis", "For the quarter, the contractual rate increase was in fact was around four percentage points.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Should investors think that's a good run rate to use in their models company going forward or based on negotiations you're having with Altice or ongoing conversations you have with other renewals that might be coming up? You expect that to improve, deteriorate, is that a good run rate number?", "Robert Bakish", "I think that the mid-singles is the right run rate to be thinking about. The content from the Altice deal, they're going to start lightning Suddenlink subs this month. They may even announce it today. They also talked about it on the earnings call and talking about a 90% penetration of Viacom services on that. So, that'll be beneficial. I think thinking about a mid-singles as a sort of annual price component is probably the right way to think about it.", "Now, of course, we will, as we get into next fiscal year, have some renewal activity. We're already in discussion around some of that. That has the potential to affect that. But as a general model, I think mid-single is the way to think about it.", "Doug Mitchelson", "And since you mentioned it, can you give investors a sense of what percentage of distribution does come up for renewal next year?", "Robert Bakish", "We don't typically disclose it. We do have staggered long-term deals, so we don't have any kind of majority distribution base coming up any year. We have deals that go so well past 2020. But we have some renewal activity and we're already in discussions around that, although these things typically don't get done early.", "Altice was a little unusual in that, and that was a deal that was done before the term ended as a result of some of the value they saw across the combination. But again, we do have -- it's an ongoing business and there are discussions, and ultimately, we're going to be focused on ensuring we get the best results for Viacom.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Bob, my other question was on M&A. I know you addressed it in your prepared remarks, but I think it will be helpful for investors that you are very focused on your turnaround strategy, improving the balance sheet as to -- as you approach whether there was a recent M&A transaction that was speculated or as you sort of look out at other possibilities, what the attractiveness of M&A might be for the company, again, notwithstanding that you'll be disciplined.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes, no, that's fair. Obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific. But in general, we think it's our obligation to look at the full range of opportunities that present itself to the company as we look to strengthen our positioning in the industry and accelerate -- and/or I should say accelerate our transition and getting to the multiplatform place that we have as our vision.", "So, we look at stuff. I believe it's beneficial to look at stuff, point one. Point two, as we do that, we are going to continue to be very rigorous and look at where we see value and how much that value is worth and ensure that we have confidence in execution so that we can capture that value.", "Again, personally, Wade, and I have been involved in a number of transactions which reflect that. Those happen to be international transactions, but I think it's important that we look.", "But rest assured, we are going to be focused on creating shareholder value. That is ultimately what this is all about and if we see an interesting transaction that can do that, then we will engage there. But beyond that, it's really hard to comment.", "Doug Mitchelson", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thanks Bob. You guys have -- you're having regular conversations with distributors. You've also extended some large ones, I think, after announcing the flagship six strategy shift. Can you just talk about how those renewals were approached on both sides as you sort of shift your investments around? I think there's a lot of concern that the revenue falls away from the non-flagship six as you move forward.", "But you've already signed some extensions with large distributors after announcing those deals. So, you maybe you could just talk about how that all works from an economics perspective now that you've done some deals post the announcement.", "And then sticking with the Media Net on expenses, same sort of kind of question. As you change the strategy at Media Nets, you've talked about not having to significantly increase investment in content. You still feel confident in that? Sitting here whatever it is, eight or nine months or seven or eight months since you first announced and you talked about the opportunities around cost as you head into the back half of next year?", "Robert Bakish", "Yes, sure. So, look, on the affiliate side, one of our -- before we get to the flagship six, which I'll address, our fundamental belief is that there's benefit to much more engagement, which is more regular engagement and broader engagement. And again, that's -- you could characterize that as a page from the international playbook, but my experience is that it yielded great dividends there and so we've been applying it here. And you could argue that the Altice outcome was an example of that working.", "Now, within that, by broadening discussion, frankly, you have more levers to play with. And this -- the ad lever in the form of data-driven advertising is a lever that has attracted a significant interest. And in fact, we're having conversations, I would say, at this point really with almost all of the distributors about that and are in various stages of expanding our partnership to address that. And importantly, as we do that, getting access to tens of millions of homes on a dynamic ad insertion basis, which again is a place where we can create value.", "Now, in the context of brand carriage, which is a component of the discussion and really the core of your question, you should conceptually think of Viacom services in three buckets: the flagship six, obviously; then another three networks that are widely distributed and have, frankly, strong audience engagement, but because of the definition of the flagship, which includes things like a piece of the feature film slate, doesn't really fit. Those are TV Land, CMT and VH1. And then there's a third segment, which is a whole set of smaller, call them, digital services with a distribution basis in 20 million -- I don't know 40 million, 50 million range, right?", "Now, if you look at the affiliate revenue composition against those buckets, the vast majority of it is in the flagship bucket, there is some real affiliate revenue in the second bucket. There's not a whole lot, maybe 5% in the third bucket. And actually I think it's even less than that.", "And so as we've gone into these discussions, first thing we're focused on is demonstrating our commitment to the value and performance of the flagship six. And if you think about that, you've got the world's leading preschool channel in Nick Jr., the world's leading kid's channel, Nickelodeon. You have MTV, which is in need of some revitalization, but frankly, on a very good track. I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing there. And by the way, that was a very well-received component of our discussions with advertisers, which I think is also a good, if you will, market test.", "We got rid of the only comedy network in the U.S. certainly and then you've got the leading African-American network. And then coming in January, you've got Spike reposition, rebranded as Paramount with really a very strong product line upcoming. And so people get that, that's valuable.", "And then when you add to the fact -- I mean, a lot of the early concerned around the flagships were like, does that mean TV Land is going away? And the reason operators were worried about that is it actually delivers very nice-sized 50-plus audiences that tend to be bill players.", "So, at least to-date, we've had, I'd say, productive discussions and in the case of Altice, a productive renewal, against the backdrop of our flagship strategy. And I think as the year -- the calendar year continues to play out, people will see that continue to gain an audience performance and that will help. So, it's certainly a subject to discussion. But as you put the facts on the table, you add these other pieces of value, to-date, we've been happy with the navigation.", "Then you asked a question about expenses, also relates to the flagship six. Let me touch on that and Wade might want to add in general. The flagship strategy is about -- it's prioritization and expense and shifting. As we look into our fiscal 2018 as an example, we're significantly increasing our investment on the Paramount side. We're also increasing investment at BET. And as a result of that, we are shifting some investment that was, historically, in some other places.", "We fundamentally believe that is the right way to ensure real brand strength and therefore portfolio value for Viacom, but it's a part of the strategy that I envisioned in February and that we are -- have been executing as we've gone through the year including in the prior quarter with our restructuring and certainly will be manifesting itself in our 2018 budget, which we're not quite done with yet. We still have a little on that. So, hopefully that helps and addresses your questions.", "Wade Davis", "Just to point that -- just to put a finer point, we don't expect any significant increase in expenses around content spending. In the aggregate, it's very much a remix. That's what we had said in the prior quarter as we were -- in the prior quarters as we were implementing this strategy.", "As you know, we're further down the road in the implementation and the content that we're bringing online. We're seeing the performance of that. We're even more confident in that guidance.", "As Bob said in his prepared remarks, that MTV is going to be able to deliver a 60% increase in the delivery of their original hours at a cost that's less than what they were seeing in the prior year. So, no significant increase. It'll be -- it's purely a remixing and we're very happy with the results.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes and think of the remix as the remix of cross-brands, which is reflecting prioritization and a remix within brands that's reflecting type of programming.", "Ben Swinburne", "Thank you.", "Robert Bakish", "We'll take our next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you. If you could provide a bit more color on your domestic advertising commentary for the September quarter. I think you said similar decline in the June quarter if I heard right.", "I guess with the ratings improvement you saw in June and more notable improvements in July, some of the [Indiscernible] networks, I guess why would we see some more improvement? Is it the ad load reduction going to be more notable maybe in the September quarter? I guess if you can sort of fill-in the missing pieces there. And then any general commentary sort of on scatter and the overall marketplace would be great.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes, so let me start then Wade will chime in. There's a couple of pieces to the answer that question, although it ends with yes. Ad load reduction is an investment we're making in the health of our brands which we believe will pay strong dividends.", "But going through it, we're coming out of an up front that we're very happy with. We have up volume. We've got a mid-singles rate of change or you could about it as CPM. Good demand across brands, so that's a nice foundation.", "Scatter right now, we're actually very pleased with scatter. I'd say it's certainly a decent market. You look at MTV as an example and scatter is up double-digits. So, we don't see any issues with access to money. We also candidly have the benefit that we do have an ADU bank that were anything to weaken a bit, we can ride through it, but again, the scatter market continues to look good.", "So, -- and we are -- we've seen ratings improvements and anticipate continuing to do so as additional new programming comes out. And when you look at October as the beginning of the fiscal, BET has a lot of programming coming; MTV, really through that -- today through them, a lot of programming coming.", "We got Klepper coming to Comedy Central to create late-night power hour with Trevor. So, we do like how this is lining up, and we do believe that the will pay dividends in terms of reported audience performance.", "However, our ad loads, in my opinion, were unhealthily high. And therefore we have taken this opportunity to use this rating growth to partially fund reduction in ad load. We think that's the right decision. But yes, that is -- and you heard Wade's commentary, if you adjust for that in the current or the third fiscal quarter just ended, we probably would have been around a plus one versus a minus two. So anyway, Wade -- you would add, Wade?", "Wade Davis", "That's exactly right. Think of it as really a three percentage point swing in terms of -- that's driven by the impression volume declines related to our deliberate decision to reduce unit loads. So, that deliberate decision is more than offsetting the impression volume gains that we get from our increased loads -- in our increased ratings.", "Robert Bakish", "That's just another revitalization step we needed to take given the hand we were dealt coming into this.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Sorry, I was going to say, does that headwind or that three percentage point swing stay consistent if we look forward in the next few quarters? I mean I'm trying to get a sense if the ratings continue to improve, despite that headwind, I would assume we would begin to see some sequential improvement, is that fair?", "Wade Davis", "No, it shouldn't -- I mean, it shouldn't continue.", "Robert Bakish", "The answer is the way you're thinking about it is fair that we should -- as we deliver additional audience gains, you will get that to flow through to the ad line. Again, we're looking at the next quarter; the services aren't fully where they need to be.", "If you think of the arc of turning around, if you will, on television network that tends to be a kind of one year window from the time you start working on programming until you get critical mass on air. So, again, we're not there yet. We have more programming coming and over time, the ad performance will follow.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will comes come from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks. Let me just follow-up for ad load and then one for Wade on balance sheet. So, on the ad load, the question I have is what type of content -- which networks are you cutting the most and what are you seeing that on the C3 benefit from cutting it?", "Wade Davis", "BET has the highest ad loads across the house and we're seeing coming into this quarter some of the strongest ratings performance improvement at BET. So, that's a place that we're cleaning up.", "But really across the house, we're using this opportunity to really walk that fine line of reaping some of the payback from the ratings gains to try and deliver a better experience for our consumers and our advertisers. So, it's really across the Board. BET is the biggest one -- and then I think you can also look at--.", "Robert Bakish", "I think MTV down, too.", "Wade Davis", "Yes, MTV. Those two are the biggest.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. And Wade, you and Bob made great strides in reducing your leverage to focus on every call. You talked about being done your leverage by $2 billion this year. So, I have to ask you, given the reported rumors of a bid for scripts using cash, a lot of people were caught off-guard because everything you've done to delever.", "So, can you talk a bit about your willingness to stay investment-grade as you look at deals? And if you're going to stay investment-grade, how is that deal going to be funded? Because we were sitting there kind of mystified, doing everything you've done so far to get back to lower debt ratios?", "Wade Davis", "Well, obviously, we're not going to comment on anything specific deal other than to say what we've said which is that we're going to -- to the extent that we're looking at M&A, which we believe is our obligation to our shareholders to do and to assess that we're going to be very disciplined in terms of how we think about delivering the right risk-adjusted return for our shareholders associated with any transaction.", "And obviously, we're balancing and looking at any transaction. There's a number of factors you're going to look at. You're going to look at the pro forma operating performance of the OP entity, a big part of which you're going to adjust taste on point of view you have on synergies.", "And then one of the things that we've demonstrated is our discipline around divesting non-core assets. And so it's possible that as we look forward to the strategic future of the company, we may take a different look at how we may free-up incremental capital from our asset base to potentially fund things that we think might be more strategic.", "So, I can't -- again, every transaction is unique. I can't comment on -- it doesn't make sense, obviously, for me to comment on any specific transaction, most notably ones that are speculation.", "But in general, we're focused on delivering shareholder value within the context of the priorities that we've laid out for folks and we're going to continue to be very disciplined around evaluating things through those lenses.", "Michael Nathanson", "Okay. Thanks Wade, thanks Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "And the other thing I would say just to add to that, -- excuse me, Mike, transaction may or may not happen. We feel we've got to look at it. At the same time, we feel very good about the asset base we own and the potential to create value and where -- that is the vast majority of our focus.", "Operator", "Rich Greenfield with BTIG has our next question. please go ahead.", "Richard Greenfield", "Hi, thanks for taking it. I've got a few questions. One, just on housekeeping. I think in the prepared remarks, you said domestic ad revenue. The trend is improving for fiscal Q4 versus fiscal Q3? I realize you're not saying whether it's up or down, but is it a continued improvement sequentially? Just want to clear that up.", "And then two, your stock has lost my guess is over 20% of its value since the charter news broke last quarter. You had indicated at the time, I believe, Bob that this is not in keeping with the way you read your contract or at least your impressions of your contract. You haven't sued them yet. They've launched a new sports list bundle without Viacom channels.", "Did [Indiscernible] and team screw-up the Charter contract, the legacy Charter contract? Is this going on litigation? And -- or is there a new deal imminently coming with Charter? I think it's had a huge outside impact on your overall stock and market cap. And then I've got the last follow-up after that.", "Wade Davis", "I'll take the ad sale piece.", "Robert Bakish", "Sure.", "Wade Davis", "So, yes, just on housekeeping, Rich, 2% decline this quarter, we think that the performance is going to be comparable in the next quarter, but it's important to underscore that we did say in my prepared remarks that the impact from the unit load reduction was comparable, right?", "So, to the extent that we saw a three percentage point more or less impact from our deliberate decision to take those units out of the marketplace, that's going to be -- you're going to see very similar dynamic in the fourth quarter with the caveat that the ratings trend that we're seeing early in the fourth quarter are pacing ahead of what we're initially modeling.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. And on the Charter question, so a couple of things. One is a strong point of view that they don't have the contractual right to tier our services in the way they have. We've obviously had that looked at by outside counsel, et cetera. So, we haven't changed our point of view on that, point one.", "Point two is I really don't fundamentally believe suing big customers is the way to solve problems. I think the better way to solve it is through engagement and exploring ways that we can create value together, and that's what we're focused on.", "Ultimately, I don't see this getting resolved in terms of the tiering until we get to any deal. And so this could take a little time. But rest assured, we're focused on it because we understand that it has caused some concerns, which in turn has likely affected the value of our stock. But again, we're focused on playing through that and ultimately getting to the right place with an important client.", "Wade Davis", "But to be clear, we're going to -- we are very focused on resolving this constructively given their importance as a client. But to the extent that we're not able to reach resolution, we are going to -- we will reserve the right to enforce.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes, that's right.", "Richard Greenfield", "And so just -- is there a timeframe you can give like your contract expires at the end of the fiscal year into the new fiscal year? And then just the larger point really for Bob. Obviously, we've had the discovery scripts transaction. Scale looks like it's becoming increasingly important as the sector matures, would you support the renewed merger with CBS if National Amusements chooses to pursue that path?", "Robert Bakish", "So, in terms of the Charter timing, look, we're not going to comment on that. You know that, we can't comment on that. And as far as a CBS-Viacom merger, that's really a decision of the Board, not myself as a CEO. Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. That will come from Jessica Wright with Bank of America.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Thank you. Just two divisional questions, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about of film, which in terms of upside, it's a smaller division, obviously, but otherwise could be very significant if you turn it around. Can you talk about some of the steps that Jim Gianopulos is taking to ensure a film turnaround?", "And going back to some of these advertising comments that you made, you've made a number of deals, Altice, and you said you'll do other distributed deals and open [Indiscernible]. How quickly you think Sean Moran's group can really drive non-traditional advertising to the revenue play?", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. So, on the Paramount side, look, it starts with you need a plan. There's a plan for Paramount, which has to do what a slate going forward including the composition that is a significant component of branded films.", "Then the plan enabling organization, which starts with leadership and there you've seen not only Jim, but now additional leadership reporting to Jim, Brian, et cetera. We have a great new television sales licensing Executive who came over from Disney. And so that's when you start going into execution.", "And you're right there is a significant opportunity to turn around Paramount. Jim is certainly excited about that and focused on that and building a team to achieve that. In the interim, it's focusing on getting the most out of the assets we have. That can go to marketing that could go to, as I said, licensing, library sales, et cetera.", "But it will be a material and really integral part of Viacom, both strategically and over time, financially. Worth noting that even with the existing slate and even with the underperformance of films like Transformers and Baywatch, we will have a nice year-to-year increase on the earnings side.", "Wade Davis", "The only thing I would add to that is I mean to the extent that your question was focused on actions that Jim has taken, so beyond charting a very well-defined slate strategy, beyond putting in place a world-class leadership team that can execute on supporting that slate strategy, just from a financial point of view, I'd just reiterate that we did take a restructuring charge this quarter that was reflective of Jim's strategy that included some -- cleaning out some development and programming that Jim didn't think was appropriate to carry forward and then was reflective of his strategy.", "So, Jim's doing -- Jim and his team are doing a lot of great work, where nearly -- actually have been kind of the medium stages of 2018's budget and we're very happy with where that's shaping up and the progress that those guys have made.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. And then on the ad sales side, a couple of comments. The advanced data, the vantage product is a real source of value for Sean and the team. And while we're through the probably -- 95% through, there's some small cleanup work to do on the up front, but that's a place where really budgets, if you will, are committed and we're still at the point then where you really turn them into actually actionable plans including how you incorporate some of these vantage products into their delivery.", "Another point I would add and it goes to the value of some of this dynamic ad insertion that we've gotten, which includes not only Altice, but Comcast and are you're starting to have significant base of essentially inventory you can utilize.", "And then if you look at a very large consumer products company from a marketing standpoint has recently indicated that they will use digital budgets to fund that kind of inventory because there's some differences in that inventory.", "These are meaningful levers that Sean not only can, but will and is, pulling as we move forward in this ad market. And again, the fact that we are a scale player in the ad market, you see the benefit that we went very early on in the queue of people that were going, which was a good thing in terms of access to budgets.", "And it's part of the story, just like, by the way, that what we're doing with the core brands, whether it's Paramount or MTV as part of the story, it's a multifaceted story, the one that has real value and has already delivered value.", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everybody for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our September quarter\u2019s earnings call. Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.", "I want to refer you to Page number 2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. Let me start by highlighting what a different a year makes. Last year on the Q4 call, when I had just been announced as Acting CEO, Viacom reported meaningful declines across all key financial metrics.", "This quarter\u2019s and this year's performance is dramatically stronger. Comparing year-over-year performance for 2017 versus 2016 on a like-for-like basis, excluding Telefe and foreign exchange consolidated revenues improved 5% versus a decline of 5%. Adjusted operating income was flat versus a decline of 30%, and operating free cash flow grew by more than $300 million versus a decline of over $1 billion in 2016.", "Finally, as part of our commitment to a strong balance sheet and maintaining investment grade metrics, since February, we paid down approximately $2 billion of debt, a reduction of 15%. This is an area we continue to be focused on and you will see further delevering over the course of 2018. Our momentum has been driven by the new strategy we introduced in February, a strategy we have spent the last nine months aggressively executing against.", "Our momentum is also the product of the many organizational and operational changes we have made to support that strategy. And it's not just financial metrics that have improved, it\u2019s operating metrics as well. Throughout 2017, we set out to fundamentally stabilize and revitalize the business and that is exactly what we've done. First, you see it in the flagship brands, which we have prioritized and put on a path to broader exposure. It's a strategy that's working. We closed the quarter with U.S. ratings across the portfolio, up 3% and flagships up 6%.", "This rating story extends internationally as well, where each and every one of our flagship brands as well as our general entertainment cornerstones Channel 5 and Telefe achieved growth in share for the first time ever. At the same time, we've made progress in broadening the expression of our brand, particularly with respect to features at Paramount, where we have a slate of branded films coming in 2019.", "Second, you see it in the partnerships that we've strengthened. In distribution per our strategy, we have in fact grown our business beyond carriage to include data, advertising, and co-production. Our renewed agreements with Altice and more recently Charter demonstrate the value of this approach.", "Here we accomplished what we intended. We secured broad distribution as part of multifaceted agreements at rates that are consistent with other large distributors and with attractive weight escalators going forward and we continue to be overwhelmingly carried on basic [tiers] [ph].", "In the past year, deals representing nearly 50% of our subscriber base have been renewed or extended and we now have no significant renewals until well into 2019. To be clear, this was a significant accomplishment at a critical time for our business that removed the major area of uncertainty that hung over the business in 2017.", "It's a key part of the stabilization story and I am very happy about it. I'm also excited to see that the gap in the market for a sports free, low cost entertainment bundle, the entertainment skinny pack that Viacom has been calling for is now starting to be filled. Just this week, we joined with Philo and a number of other entertainment content companies to announce a first-of-its kind U.S. product offered to consumers at $16 per month.", "But it's not just distribution you also see the growing strength of our partnerships in the ad market too, where our strong relationships, industry-leading innovation, and growing ratings have improved [Indiscernible] ad sales revenue by eight percentage points from last year's minus eight to this quarter's flat, a dramatic improvement in performance.", "Third, you see it across the talent and IP at our brand, whether that's the cross-house deal with Tyler Perry who's writing a film for BET as we speak or the joining of Jim Cameron and Paramount Pictures for the next new Terminator films, or the iconic band U2 rocking Trafalgar Square in London as part of the MTV EMA last weekend. There's a fresh energy and talent vitality across Viacom and that is critically important for a creative company like ours.", "Four, you see it in our expanding digital and real world offerings. On the digital front we piloted a series of initiatives and are now about to accelerate our push into digital native content with the launch of Viacom Digital Studios under Kelly Day\u2019s leadership. Kelly formerly Chief Digital Officer of Awesomeness brings deep expertise to the table to help take our brands to a significantly higher level in the space, and what I call the real world, we have doubled attendance at Viacom event this year to over 2 million people and we have significant room to grow this, our Consumer Products business further, which I'll talk about in a moment.", "Fifth, and finally, you see it in the energy in our buildings all around the world. Today we are more integrated, efficient and creative organization and I've been blown away by how this organization has embraced the new strategy and executed so quickly to drive our meaningful progress.", "Taken together, these were all important steps forward for Viacom and more importantly, we now have a strong stable foundation from which to attack a changing media landscape. The stabilization effort did have some near-term cost. From a revenue standpoint, the combined effect of renewal driven rate reset with the industry-wide decline in pay-TV subs will contribute to some further softness in domestic affiliate revenues, particularly in the first half of 2018.", "But as the year goes on, we will see the benefit of regaining distribution at Charter combined with easing of rate renewal comps, these efforts will allow Viacom to once again get the full benefit of its annual escalators and set the stage for return to affiliate growth in 2019. And it's off this now stable base we've established that we have turned our attention to the next phase of the journey, which is accelerating the transition to long-term sustainable growth in both revenue and OI.", "But before I take you through that, let me turn it over to Wade, who will go over our quarterly and fiscal year results.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Bob. Good morning. We are pleased to report our financial results for the September quarter full-year fiscal 2017. The quarter and for the full-year, we saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment as well as growth in operating free cash flow.", "First, I will discuss the consolidated results for the year. Viacom generated revenue of $13.3 billion, 6% increase over the prior year and adjusted operating income $2.7 billion that was flat with last year. Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment grew revenues. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $3.77, an increase of 2% over the prior year and we've generated $1.5 billion of operating free cash flow, which is up 26% over last year, demonstrating the durability of our cash flows. This represents operating free cash flow per share of $3.77, which translates to an operating free cash flow yield of 15%.", "Now moving to the results for the quarter. Viacom generated $3.3 billion of revenue and $578 million of adjusted operating income, up 3% and 7% respectively over the prior year. Both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment grew revenues. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter was up 12% year-over-year.", "As we previously announced, Paramount has secured a series of individual financing agreement, which replaces our prior slate financing deal and better aligned with the studio's new slate strategy, consisting of a mix of big broad audience films and more targeted flagship branded films. More flexible and tailored financing model will allow us to capture greater upside and more modestly budgeted titles were presently there is no third-party financing.", "Given the decision to end the slate financing deal with HuaHua and pursue alternative financing arrangement, we recorded a net $59 million negative impact on operating income in the quarter related to the write-off of amounts previously reported. Absent this impact, EPS would have been $0.88 in the quarter.", "Turning to our segments. Slide 4 of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment. Revenues for the quarter increased by 3% to $2.6 billion, worldwide advertising revenues increased 6%, and ancillary revenues were up 5%, while affiliate revenues declined 1%. Adjusted operating income declined by 8% to $693 million.", "Slide 5 of the web deck provides the breakdown of our Media Networks domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues decreased 2% to $2 billion, while international revenues increased by 24% to $593 million. On organic basis, absent a four percentage point favorable foreign currency impact and 14 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue would have grown 6% a quarter.", "At our Media Networks business, domestic advertising in the quarter improved sequentially to flat year-over-year, which exceeded our prior guidance. This compares to a year-over-year decline of 2% in the June quarter. In the quarter, ratings growth was largely offset by an overall decline in cable subscribers and our strategic reduction in unit load to improve the viewer experience.", "Domestic affiliate revenues decreased 3%. Decrease in the quarter was due to the lower revenues from SVOD and OTT agreement, decline in subscribers including continued flow through from Charter re-tiering and the transitional impact from rate resets associated with renewals.", "These factors were partially offset by mid single-digit contractual rate increases. 12% decline in Media Networks domestic ancillary revenue to $76 million is principally due to lower consumer products revenues and lower revenues from our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise ahead of its relaunch in 2018.", "Now turning to international. Advertising revenues increased 36% in the quarter. Absent a 3 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 26 percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe, organic international advertising revenues would have been up 7%. The organic performance reflects strength in Europe.", "International affiliate revenues increased 12% including a 4 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 2 percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe.", "Growth in the quarter reflects the impact of new channel launches, rate increases, and subscriber growth. 21% increase in Media Networks international ancillary revenue to $105 million included a 7 percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 7 percentage point benefit from Telefe. The organic growth benefited from our strategy to grow our off-network business driven by revenue from our recreational deals and higher consumer product license.", "Worldwide expenses increased 7% in the quarter and included a 4 percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe. In operating expenses, programming expense increased 12% driven primarily by the timing of original programming premieres and the acquisition of Telefe, while distribution and another expense declined 2%. SG&A expense increased 3% in the quarter which included a 3 percentage point impact from Telefe.", "Now turning to the studios results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues were up 2%, as increases in license fees and ancillary revenue were partially offset by decreases in Theatrical and Home Entertainment revenues. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues.", "Theatrical revenues decreased 43% to $115 million, principally reflecting lower revenue from our current quarter releases. Higher carryover revenues driven by Transformers, The Last Knight were more than offset by difficult comparison to the release of Star Trek Beyond in the September quarter of last year.", "License fees increased 30% to $423 million driven by higher Paramount Television production revenue as well as higher revenues from pay-TV and SVOD. Paramount Television continued its significant growth more than tripling its revenues in the fiscal year through breakout releases, including Shooter, 13 Reasons Why and Berlin Station, all of which were renewed for a second season.", "Ancillary revenues increased 33% to $61 million in the quarter. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $43 million in the quarter which included the $59 million negative impact related to our decision to end our prior slate financing arrangement. This compares to a loss of $137 million in the prior year, an improvement of $94 million. The improvement was driven by the increase in revenues and lower operating expenses.", "In term of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate for the fiscal year was 30% as compared to 31.7% in the prior year. This was driven by the mix of domestic and international income. Components of free cash flow are broken out in Slide 11 of the earnings presentation. We generated $962 million of operating free cash flow in the quarter and 9% improvement versus the prior year.", "For the fiscal year, we generated $1.5 billion of operating free cash flow which is up 26% year-over-year. The increase in full-year operating free cash flow was principally driven by improvements in working capital at Filmed Entertainment, including lower film spend, partially offset by higher cash taxes.", "Turning to Slide 10. Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9 and our commitment to reducing leverage and maintaining investment-grade metrics, we have made meaningful progress, reducing gross debt by approximately $2 billion or 15%.", "In terms of our debt, at quarter end, it was principally fixed rate with a weighted-average cost of 4.9%. We had $11.1 billion of total debt outstanding cash equivalents increased $1.4 billion. If you take into consideration, the equity credit we received on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $10.5 billion.", "I want to echo Bob's commitment to strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining investment grade metrics. Over the course of fiscal 2018, we will continue to pursue opportunities to delever. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018 transitional impacts from our renewed distributor relationships will continue to flow through our results, particularly in the first half of the year.", "The near-term, we anticipate pressure on domestic affiliate revenues driven in large part by rate resets, lower SVOD revenues and the subscriber declines, which are amplified by a lag in the penetration improvement associated with our recent Charter renewal. Domestic affiliate revenues will show high single-digit declines in Q1 and Q2 with these declines improving in the second half, resulting in a mid single-digit decline for fiscal 2018.", "Importantly, we expect that the momentum we gained in the back half of 2018 will set us up to return to domestic growth as we get into fiscal 2019, we benefit from regaining Charter distribution, flat renewal rate resets and fully benefit from contractual rate increases. This guidance reflects the transitional impact of our successful efforts to stabilize the distributor base and position us to drive new opportunities for future growth with our distributor. As of international affiliate revenues in fiscal 2018, we anticipate continued growth.", "Turning to the ad sales, in the December quarter, we expect to see overall growth driven by continued strength of International, a low single-digit decline on the domestic side due to some ratings softness. We expect domestic performance to improve over the year with positive growth in the back half due to new original programming coming on air, as well as greater carriage benefits and contributions from digital initiatives.", "Turning to Media Networks fiscal 2018 programming expenses, we expect the growth rate will be in the low to mid single-digits and continue to invest in our flagship networks, while benefiting from a shift in mix to non-scripted programming. Network from our programming expense, we see the opportunity to reinvent our cost structure to drive margin and profitability.", "Based on the plan we have constructed, we project cost savings approximately $100 million in fiscal 2018, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars of additional run rate savings, most of which will be realized by fiscal 2019 and will drop to the bottom line. Accordingly, fiscal 2018 Media Networks SG&A expense will improve by low single-digits driven by these cost initiatives.", "Moving to the Studio, Paramount Pictures new management team has moved quickly to begin production on a 2019 slate and find cost efficiencies in production and marketing to enhance the bottom line. For fiscal 2018, we anticipate hundreds of millions of dollars operating income improvement.", "Finally, for fiscal 2018, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%. We will refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of the domestic versus international profitability.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "Thanks Wade. So no question, the industry is changing, but we see so much opportunity in all this change, because we know our audiences are consuming more content than ever before and that's why they're evolving our content, product line and business to enable Viacom's greater participation in that consumption.", "And again now that we have a stable foundation, we have been ramping up our ability to do just that. If 2017 was about stabilization of Viacom, 2018 is all about acceleration, especially when it comes to important growth initiatives. We have a global content engine with diversity and depth of content across film, television and increasingly digital-native and real world experience.", "We have global infrastructure for creation, packaging and monetization and we have seen piloted and gained experience with alternative models outside the U.S., all of which we are benefiting from as we leverage our base to accelerate growth across three broad opportunity areas.", "First, accelerating the evolution of Viacom's media business to better serve next-generation platforms and solutions. Second, pushing the diversification of our business to grow our revenue footprint outside of media. And third and finally, growing share and margins both in our core domestic networks business as well as at Paramount film and television production to drive earnings growth and what continues to be a very large and profitable business.", "Let\u2019s go through each of these. First, we are accelerating the evolution of Viacom's media business, ramping up our push into next-generation platforms and solutions. This is a multifaceted opportunity to expanding both B2B and B2C providing access to subscription, advertising, and production revenue stream on a global level.", "Let's start with the enormous assets we have. We have a TV library with more than 10,000 unencumbered hours of content. We have an iconic film studio that not only produces premium content, but its home to a library with 100 years' worth of movies. And we are launching a digital studio that will produce short form content at scale. We are now focusing on how we can leverage, package and further monetize these incredible assets in innovative ways on multiple platforms.", "Specific opportunity segments include OTT, licensing our products to third-party OTT distributors such as Sling and Sky Now and newer entrants like Philo as well as mobile platforms like Bima TV and dTV in Japan or Telkomsel in Indonesia. It also includes our own direct-to-consumer experiences, maximizing our free and authenticated apps, standalone subscription services such as Noggin and an international app version of BET and new experiences to come.", "Finally, there are advanced advertising and brand solutions. These include our large and growing pool of addressable video inventory on our O&O platforms and the third-party inventory we have access to our distribution partnership. The good news is that these are not businesses we just have to create from scratch. In fact in fiscal 2017, the next-generation platform and solution business generated more than $350 million in revenue. The better news is that we can grow this substantially and that is what we are increasingly turning our efforts to.", "Growth will be driven by new Viacom DTC products as well as the inclusion of our existing programming and additional OTT and mobile distribution platforms. In fact mobile with its billions of connected video enabled devices and increasingly commoditize and competitive structure as an enormous potential to drive growth. As an example of that potential, consider our recent experience in Japan where we created made for mobile versions of MTV that now have more viewers than MTV linear on pay-TV. And MTV linear ratings are at year-to-year high.", "Through this end some initiatives we will take advantage of pilot work, we've been doing outside the U.S. over the past 24 months as well as those 10,000 hours of TV library content. Those will also be driven by the rapid expansion of Viacom\u2019s digital-native content including that created by Viacom Digital Studios as we ramp up this important content factor. And again, this is both a distribution and advertising revenue opportunity and it provides important promotional linkages to the other expressions of the flagship brand and it's global.", "All told, these areas are targeted to grow more than 25% to approximately $450 million in 2018 with a plan to deliver more than $1 billion organically by 2020. Going forward, we will continue to update you on our progress in these areas given their increasing importance to our business.", "Second, pushing our diversification into businesses with synergies to our traditional core. In February, we announced we would increase our focus on businesses that live off the screen and in the real world. This area leverages our global brands, IP, promotion, and operational infrastructure that strategically create revenue streams that are incremental to and independent from business.", "Our global consumer products and live event businesses are the key elements of this area. In 2017, these build an $80 million of revenues and are currently expected to deliver approximately 25% growth to $350 million in 2018. And we have a plan in place to deliver between $500 million and $600 million of revenue by 2020.", "Growth of the Consumer Products business will be driven by leveraging Viacom's full portfolio of IP, including that associated with both TV and Film in a more structured way. We will also benefit from the launch of new IP like Nick Jr., top-ranked as well the relaunch of existing IP like the new version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that is coming this year.", "And increasingly, we will build partnerships with third-party IP owners to represent their Consumer Products business generating substantial economies of scale for both our partners and Viacom's benefit. It is through this combination of initiatives that Viacom can create a true scale position in the marketplace over the next few years.", "Moving to our Live business. Growth will be driven by new licensed recreation and theme park properties, growth of existing events, and new events. This includes next month opening of the SpongeBob musical on Broadway here in New York. The opening of various licensed international destinations over the next few years, which are already in the pipeline, and the further growth and commercialization of existing events by Comedy Central Colossal Clusterfest and the BET experience. As with next generation platforms and solutions we look forward to sharing details on our Consumer Products and Live business over the coming quarters.", "Third, and finally, we will create earnings growth both in our Core Domestic Networks business as well that Paramount Film and television production by growing share and margins. On the Domestic Networks side, we see a clear path to share growth through the flagship strategy we're already executing on and we see audience share improving as the quarter goes on where relative to last year, we've back loaded premier volume growth to better fit with pay viewing seasonality and the related audience opportunity. We're also looking for the launch of the Paramount Network on January 18, 2018 as a next the very exciting milestone.", "In addition, as Wade mentioned we'll continue to improve our cost structure to grow our margins and drive profitability. We see considerable opportunity through changes related to procurement, real estate and automation as well as various other efficiencies the capture approximately 100 million in savings in fiscal 2018 and additional run rate savings in the hundreds of millions mostly realized by fiscal 2019 and all of these savings will boost income.", "Beyond this let me remind you that our Network\u2019s business is global and that our International business has a very strong momentum having grown earnings strong double-digits in 2017. This is a business that has substantial growth ahead of it and one that includes 50% of an unconsolidated India business that is now doing more than $0.5 billion in revenue.", "On the Paramount side, we see significant share and margin growth as this great content engine completes it's already underway turnaround and the new slate strategy a mix of big tentpole titles and smaller branded films comes to theaters in 2019. This combined with our growing slate of TV production, which tripled revenue in 2017 will drive material earnings growth at the studio.", "It is important to note that Viacom\u2019s ownership of Paramount differentiates Viacom from many of its TV Network peers, particularly those focused on the pay TV space. We also believe both of these businesses International and Paramount, are real sources of unrecognized value, particularly in an evolving Media business. We couldn't be more excited about the year ahead and where we're going to take this business.", "We have culturally and commercially powerful brands diversity and depth of content and the global infrastructure and expertise to accelerate growth across three areas of opportunity and create value for our shareholders. And underlying all of this work are Viacom's devoted audiences.", "In a world of ever expanding consumer choice, passionate and loyal fans are more critical than ever. Viacom is the most watched cable family in the country and we rank number one among our young and diverse audiences for a reason. Our ability to create powerful, relevant content, sparks passion in our fans like no one else in our industry, and in an environment where direct relationship with your fans is fast becoming a competitive imperative, Viacom is one of the handful of media companies in the world that can persuasively make that claim.", "Lastly and very importantly to me, as we look ahead, I am committed to further igniting the culture of creativity that makes Viacom great and which is essential to our success in the future. That means making the best content, any genre, any format, any length, or any platform.", "Content we are proud to make and our audiences are proud to share. That means attracting the best talent in front of the camera, behind it and in every office and that means being seen as a creative problem solvers, a team that is continually pushing the envelope when it comes to products, packaging and promotion, helping to lead the industry evolution and working with our partners to do so. Finally, know we will execute and deliver in the months ahead with the same discipline and passion as we have in the last nine months.", "Thank you. Now we'll take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from John Janedis with Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Hi. Thanks guys. Maybe two for me, it's somewhat related. One is, given the visibility, you just sort of laid out on domestic affiliate growth from a pricing perspective and then the deals you've locked in. I guess and then layering in the sub losses, can you help us a little more in terms of the bridge on the assumptions there in terms of sub losses and the path of that growth in 2019?", "And then I guess related for Wade possibly. Can you speak to the comments on margins and growth in the Media segment? Is the read-through here that you expect margin growth this year even with the pressure on domestic affiliate growth or is that more of a 2019 event?", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. Hey, John, how you\u2019re doing? I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll flip it to Wade as you suggested. So in 2017, we accomplished what we setout to do on the affiliate side, which was securing broad distribution as part of broadening partnerships and entering into the associate agreements. And we did that at rates in line with other large distributors and with attractive escalators going forward.", "And as we said, in the past years, deals representing nearly 50% of our sub base have been either renewed or extended and a significant number of those were outside of cycle and so it's part of us proactively addressing the sub base. And again to be clear, this was a real accomplishment at a critical time for Viacom and it's a major part of the stabilization story and we do have no significant renewals now until well into 2019.", "Now to your question, so September quarter financials reflect the combined impact of really three different elements and that is kind of runway to the business, the impact of renewals and then activity outside of that whether that\u2019s SVOD or the like. So when you look at the run way in the business, we see industry sub declines in line with what the industry [Indiscernible] have been talking about, this is the minus 3.5 that we have talked about before. You apply to that our annual escalators.", "The second part \u2013 but there is one slight negative, which makes our number worse than minus 3.5 on a temporary basis, which is the impact of the Charter tiering. And that's a situation we have resolved, and that will roll off going forward, but that shows up both in the September \u2013 in the fourth quarter and it shows up in part of 2018.", "Moving to the renewals, as we said, we entered into a number of new affiliate deals, which included rate resets. That is \u2013 actually will comp through as we go through 2018. And then there's the third part, which is the SVOD part, and as we stated that's a business we've moved away from as we prepared for our next leg of growth and that's a leg of growth that we talked some about that.", "So when you put that all together, you see our 2018 affiliate business as down mid-single digits. It will be more than that in the beginning of year. It will improve in the second half of year as we comp through some of these things.", "Wade Davis", "And with respect to margins and growth for Media Networks, so as we said we're very focused on efficiency for the Media Networks business. Bob did highlight some of the headwinds we have in the first half of the year, but those headwinds are substantially unwinding in the second half of the year.", "We do expect to see significant margin enhancement in the second half of the year. And as it relates to overall OI growth for the year that\u2019s largely going to be a function of the timing of some of the cost savings that we see come online, but you can expect it to be essentially flat or growing depending on the timing of that. But definitively the overall company will grow operating income...", "Robert Bakish", "And I also want to emphasis on the affiliate side and as we transition through 2018, we will see a return to growth in 2019.", "John Janedis", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne", "Thanks. Maybe just picking up on actually both those topics. Bob, I think the market, if you look at your stock price, obviously had some questions about your ability to drive affiliate revenues over time. And there's concern that every renewal that you have will lead to a reset. So when you look at what happened this year, the conversations you're having with distributors and the fact that you\u2019ve actively renewed with some. Can you contrast this process with what you expect the process to be in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 and beyond as you go through what will hopefully be a more normalized renewal process? ", "And then Wade just wondering if you could help us \u2013 you talked a lot about growing company OI in 2018, which is good to hear. Could you help us on free cash flow and what you expect for free cash flow versus 2017?", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. So I'd say the difference now versus the future is really threefold. One is we have to address some friction in our relationships that have been built up over time, and so we spend a lot of time with affiliates. And as part of that going to the second part, we brought to the table a broader value equation, which includes not only licensing affiliate feeds, but also participating in adding value in the ad space and in the case of charter doing some co-production.", "Now we did all that in a time where we're still revitalizing our product on the flagship side. And we did all that including with charter with a place where we did have a significant gap in rate given their current size. So as I look forward the two things that changed are, one is the products getting a lot stronger and we're able to leverage this proven at that time a broader relationship. So no, I anticipate that this is part of the stabilization process and as we move forward we leave that in our [tail lights] [ph].", "Wade Davis", "And as it relates to free cash flow, we had a very good year from a cash tax standpoint in 2017. So whether or not we will grow free cash flow in the aggregate, is going to be a function of cash taxes which obviously for everybody is a little bit up in the air in terms of tax reform and for us is going to be a function of domestic and international mix.", "But fundamentally the operating part of our business, Media Networks, corporate Filmed Entertainments, we will grow cash flow out of those areas. So whether or not overall free cash flow growth for the company is going to be a function of cash taxes but it will grow out of the operating elements of the business.", "Benjamin Swinburne", "That's very helpful. Maybe just one follow-up, Bob on the advertising side, which was a nice surprise this quarter, as you pick up Suddenlink distribution and the re-tiering at Charter unwinds, is that a material tailwind to the ad business given you're going to pick up a lot more potential viewers?", "Robert Bakish", "It\u2019s definitely a tailwind that will roll in as we get into 2018.", "Benjamin Swinburne", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "Thanks. I have two different topics. First, in light of the potential Fox, Disney transaction on AT&T, Time Warner just in light of some of the reshaping of the media industry. Can you give us your thoughts on where Paramount sits given its size? You said its core to the business and it differentiates you, but would you consider getting bigger and if so could you talk about potential structures you would consider?", "And the second topic is on the newer cable deals, it seems like there's two pieces, advertising piece and a content piece. Can you give us a little bit more color on each of those and it sounds like you're getting not just more data analytics, but maybe more inventory, and then on the other side you've decreased inventory load. Can you just give us color across that whole piece? Thank you.", "Robert Bakish", "Yes. Sure, Jessica. Let me take the Paramount piece and then I\u2019ll let Wade fill in some of the details. So on Paramount, as you stated, we view it as an integral part of the company, it's part of our flagship brand strategy, we're thrilled with the new team we have in place, we have an industry leading team there, and we're very excited about what's in the pipeline for 2019 and by the way that's not just the film side that the television side as well, which as we remark tripled revenue in 2017.", "We are highly confident in our ability to drive organic growth there as that great content engine really comes back to the fore. And so that\u2019s the business we think is great as it is and we look very much forward to. So we don't believe to answer your question we need to combine it with another film studio. Wade?", "Wade Davis", "Sure. So first I'd like say with respect to our strategy in changing the nature of our affiliate relationship, so we did announce in February that we\u2019re focused on really reinventing the nature of these relationships to become much more multifaceted and allow us to strengthen the overall value proposition of the pay-TV echo system with our distribution partners.", "And so you saw that in our \u2013 you\u2019ll see it again in Charter where in addition to the core content licensing. We've also introduced content co-production as well as an innovative approach to advertising an advanced data that allows both of us to grow our revenues associated in these two areas.", "As it relates to the co-production part, this is a great place where in the Charter, example we're creating value for both companies. Charter gets the first window for the exclusive content in their footprint and then we get a second window of exclusive airing nationally. And this is also going to be produced by Paramount, it\u2019s going to grow revenue for Paramount TV, it\u2019s going to grow library value for Paramount and continue to fuel this important area of growth for us.", "As it relates to ad sales, it\u2019s a separate agreement between us and Charter outside of affiliate agreement to collaborate on advance data and advertising opportunities that are going to accelerate the penetration of dynamic ad insertion into the TV infrastructure. This creates new valuable and probably most important differentiated pools of inventory for both Charter and Viacom similar to Altice. And as far as we know we're the only company in the space that's kind of leading this transformation of the nature of these relationships to include these multiple facets.", "Jessica Reif Cohen", "And then what about the advertising decrease? How much did you decrease your load?", "Wade Davis", "Over the course of 2017 we decreased the load about 7%. It\u2019s among the factors that Bob indicated that are going to fuel the growth in domestic ad sales over the course of 2018 will be lapping that in addition to the other factors that Bob indicated.", "Robert Bakish", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And we will take our final question from Rich Greenfield with BTIG Capital Markets.", "Mark Kelley", "Hi, guys. This is Mark Kelley on for Rich. Thanks for taking the question. When you say growth in 2019 affiliates, is that assuming a 3.5% loss of subs because the industry as a whole not just Viacom is underestimated the rate of cord cutting and shaving? So what gives you comfort in that runway for 2019? Thanks.", "Robert Bakish", "So as I mentioned there's three components of the affiliate equation. There is the run rate which is where your 3.5% would fall in. There's the renewals which wouldn't apply to this answer and then there's the other business which you think of us as SVOD. So where we see growth is really in the first component and the third component and we don't see a significant renewal activity in 2019.", "Important to note that \u2013 you're right, I mean we have the 3.5% that's a plus or minus, we'll see that whether it plays out, but we do anticipate continued activity in the VMVPD space and importantly in the mobile space. So when you think about mobile as I mentioned in my remarks, you have at least in the case of U.S. hundreds of millions of subscribers, obviously billions worldwide and look at what's going on in mobile now.", "We've been piloting video distribution on mobile outside the U.S., we begin to see some of that activity in the U.S. And by the time we get into 2019, we believe that will be a factor and that will be a strong positive.", "Mark Kelley", "Thank you.", "End of Q&A", "James Bombassei", "We want to thank everyone for joining us on our earnings call.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

(NASDAQ:VIAB) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  8, 2018  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "James Bombassei - SVP, IR", "Robert Bakish - President and CEO", "Wade Davis - EVP and CFO", "Analysts", "Alexia Quadrani - JP Morgan", "John Janedis - Jefferies LLC", "Rich Greenfield - BTIG", "Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley", "Michael Nathanson - Moffett", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom First Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir.", "James Bombassei", "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us for our December quarter earnings call.", "Joining me for today's discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; and Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website.", "I want to refer you to page number two in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today's remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on the call can be found in our earnings release or on our website.", "Before we begin I want to note that while we put out a statement last week, announcing the establishment of a special committee of independent directors to evaluate a potential combination with CBS, we will not be responding to any questions or comments about that process. The purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter results and performance.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.", "Three months ago, we told you that if 2017 was about stabilizing and revitalizing Viacom then 2018 is all about transforming our company for the future. We said, we would fast-track our evolution into next-generation platforms and solutions that we'd further expand our business beyond TV and film, all grow in share and margins in our existing core business.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "I'm happy to say that we accelerated these transformation efforts in the first quarter making important strategic progress. On the numbers, let me remind you that on the last call, we talked about Q1 and the first half of 2018 as being transitional quarters, which would not fully reflect the value of our strategy. At the same time, I want you to note that we are on track for growth in the second half of the year and in fact, now see upside to our prior guidance.", "So, let's start with our progress growing share and margins in our core business. The first headline here, our flagship focus continues to work. Overall flagship share growth continued in the quarter, bright spots include MTV and BET, which are now in their third consecutive quarter of ratings growth.", "In fact, MTV was the second fastest growing major cable network in Primetime. And beyond the flagships, VH1, CMT, and TV Land also grew ratings in the quarter. ", "-->", "[Author:G]", "And of course, Viacom's flagship strategy is what led to our most ambitious rebrand yet, with the launch of Paramount Network last month. Kicking off with a live Lip Sync Battle at Adobe Theater, Paramount Network quickly followed-up with the first episodes of Waco, a high-quality cinematic mini-series, it's on a clear message to talent and business partners that we're playing to win in the premium content space.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "While it's early days at Paramount Network, the results so far are encouraging. In its launch week, the Network reached 12.1 million viewers in the highly coveted 18 to 49 demographic, an increase of nearly 20% versus the prior week.", "Up next, Heathers, a modern-day re-imagining of the 80's classic film, then American Woman, which stars Alicia Silverstone and Mena Suvari amid the rise of feminism in the 1970s, followed by Yellowstone, an epic and cinematic, dramatic series created by Taylor Sheridan and starring Kevin Costner.", "The second headline in our core business, we're continuing efforts to strengthen traditional revenue streams and we see an improving picture relative to three months ago. In the quarter, domestic affiliate revenue was in line with previous guidance and we now anticipate better than expected results throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, as we benefit from our partner first approached with distributors.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "I'm happy to tell you that our return to carriage with Suddenlink was effectuated in the first quarter, and as of February, our largest networks are back to their previous fully penetrated positions across Charter's most widely distributed tier. Something that has happened faster than we initially anticipated. That combined with stronger than expected VMVPD performance has resulted in our subscriber trends improving to the mid-2% decline range from the mid-3% range, we had previously discussed.", "In fact, we now believe full-year domestic affiliate revenue will decline on the low-end of mid-single-digits, a 200-basis point improvement versus the guidance we gave you in the prior quarter.", "Moving to ad sales, in the first quarter, worldwide advertising revenue gains were driven by the continued strong performance of Viacom International Media Networks partially offset by universe [ph] declines and rating challenges at certain networks domestically.", "However, we believe we have reached a turning point in our domestic advertising story. As digital revenues continue to grow strongly, audience share improves and Charter and Suddenlink subs are back in our distribution.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "We now expect domestic ad revenue to improve sequentially, over the balance of the year with positive growth in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we expect continued strong growth across our international networks.", "The third headline in our core business. The turnaround of Paramount Pictures is well within sight. With Q1 behind us, we now have just a few films left on our legacy slate. And we are particularly excited about our Summer Tentpole, which has Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt returning for the sixth installment of the incredibly successful Mission Impossible series.", "Very importantly, we have now finished building out our best-in-class leadership team at Paramount, including the recent additions of Wick Godfrey, President of Motion Picture Group, and David Sameth, the new Head of Worldwide Marketing who joins from Disney Pixar.", "With his team in place, Jim Gianopulos is laser-focused on returning the studio to growth. And we're very excited about how the 29 team slate is coming together, including the fact that we anticipate half the slate will be co-branded productions through our Paramount Players division, which focuses on driving attractive economics on a fast production cycle. With eight branded films planned for 2019, Paramount Pictures is bringing Viacom's flagship brands to the big screen in a big way, which Viacom is uniquely positioned to do.", "And with three new major production deals signed with Hasbro, Skydance and the Fast and Furious producer Neal Moritz, plus Wick Godfrey's immense film experience at the helm, we'll be able to further feed the studio's pipeline in the years ahead, including bringing to life exciting tent pole films like a Transformer spin-off Bumblebee, Gemini Man, a Top Gun sequel and more.", "Building on the successes of 2017, Paramount Television continues to expand TV production relationships with top talent, including George Clooney, who will direct and star in Catch-22, a limited series for Hulu, and John Krasinski as the new Jack Ryan in the series picked up by Amazon.", "Additionally, the Alienist, a limited series for TMT just premiered as Cable's number one new drama series this season in live-plus-three. With win after win, Paramount continues to gain credibility in the space and it's doing so, in an environment where demand has never been stronger.", "Before I move on from the core business, I also like to note that we are on track with our cost transformation initiatives and efforts to improve margins. This quarter saw Viacom make meaningful progress, including through an organizational realignment that reunites all support functions across Viacom Media Networks, new sourcing and procurement policies, real estate consolidation and more. All told, we anticipate these initiatives will deliver $100 million in cost savings this year and generate hundreds of millions of savings on an annual run rate basis.", "Moving beyond the core business to our second area of strategic focus, accelerating our efforts in next-generation platforms and solutions, this has been a huge area of focus for our company and we're thrilled with our progress in dramatically ramping up our digital efforts. One of the most important developments on this front in the quarter was the launch of Viacom Digital Studios, the digital studio is now executing against the clear vision to produce unique video content at scale to build loyalty and engagement for our flagship brands, to become the first choice home for a wide range of young talent, to develop an ecosystem where our massive social footprint supports a wide range of partnerships and distribution models, and to create a diversified, profitable digital business.", "Our goals for this division are ambitious. We are going to increase video views to 2x in 2018, we are also going to increase watch time on YouTube and Facebook by 3.5 times by the end of the year. And VDS isn't just focused on short-form content production, they are working closely with our ad sales and distribution teams to evolve our offerings to mobile and OTT platforms and creatively connect partners to our brands and talent, which is one of the reasons why we recently acquired WHOSAY, an early mover and influence marketing with a strong track record of executing campaigns for major brands. ", "-->", "[Author:G]", "WHOSAY will work with Viacom digital studios and our ad sales team to produce premium original content, innovative advertising solutions and truly multi-platform distribution for our brand partners.", "In addition to ad supported social video, VDS is also partnering with our distribution team to power our products for digital and mobile platforms. Here, we are already in a range of discussions with carriers in U.S. who see the combination of our existing news and entertainment brands, tent pole events and new digital native series and talent as a potentially compelling new source of value in a very competitive marketplace. ", "And outside the U.S., we're already bringing product to mobile. Earlier this week, we announced a major step forwarded in the mobile entertainments space working with Telefonica in Latin America.", "In a first for Telefonica and its mobile and broadband subscribers, their mobile platform Movistar Play will carry live feeds of MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Junior, Comedy Central and the Paramount channel across Latin America, beginning in the first half of fiscal 2018.", "In addition, Telefonica will have on-demand content available via our mobile streaming apps and its important note that economically this looks like a traditional Pay-TV deal with monthly affiliate revenue per subscriber.", "This first of a kind deal for Viacom is a critical first step in what we talked about on our last call, bringing a new product to new distributors on a global basis. As we've said before, we believe mobile is a big opportunity globally and we're focused on quickly unlocking it. ", "Finally, as we discussed on our last call, we continue to expect to launch a significant and differentiated direct to consumer experience by the end of this fiscal year.", "Moving to our third strategic priority, diversifying beyond our core business, as we said on the last call, we believe there is a lot of opportunity to expand and grow our live events and consumers product businesses in particular, and we made some important progress in Q1.", "Building on the success of our International events business, every flagship brand now will have a live event in U.S. including Comedy Central's recently renewed Clusterfest, BET's BET Experience, and Nickelodeon's upcoming SLIMEFEST. ", "And even Viacom Digital Studios will have its own tent pole event. We just announced our acquisition of VidCon, the largest and most popular multi-day conference celebrating online video. This partnership will feed our next-gen and live events businesses placing Viacom at the center of the important conversations, innovations, and talent driving the future of content.", "Think about this as VDS's VMAs. Here on Broadway, the SpongeBob Musical is also off to a very strong start, following its highly acclaimed debut. We're also making meaningful strides to grow our consumer products business.", "Last call, we said we wanted to start putting our global CP infrastructure and expertise to work for other brands beyond our own. And in Q1, we struck a deal with Mattel to be their exclusive U.S. agent for Thomas the Tank Engine across many key non-toy CP categories. A strategy you'll be hearing more about in the coming year.", "Finally, before I turn the call over to Wade, I want to discuss our International business, which is firing on all cylinders.", "In the quarter, International had double-digit growth in overall revenues, affiliate sales and ad sales, and very strong double-digit growth in earnings. And there is a bigger strategic story underlying those numbers.", "International strong track record of creating new incremental value across a variety of markets and models, like in India, where through our joint venture Viacom18, we took a loss-making business and turn it into a fast-growing top three diversified media and entertainment company with revenues up over $500 million.", "Last week, we announced a transaction with our partner where we would sell 1% of the business at a $2 billion valuation. We did this deal to set the company up for its next wave of growth by more closely aligning with our partner's affiliated Jio platform, one of the largest and fastest growing mobile, broadband and video distribution platforms in India, having grown to 160 million subs in just over a year since launch.", "This is fantastic for Viacom18 and for Viacom since we retain a 49% stake. We're very excited about the road ahead.", "The latest success story for international is in Latin America. One year ago, we bought Telefe, a dominant local broadcaster in Argentina. Today, it's serving as a platform for global growth.", "Let me explain. We acquired Telefe because we knew we wanted more scale in Latin America across audience, advertising and distribution. We also knew we wanted to own more content and production capabilities to satisfy the huge and growing demand for quality Spanish language content to feed global platforms, both ours and others.", "When we acquired Telefe, they were producing 3500 hours of high-quality content per year yet monetized little beyond their own network. As a standalone market specific broadcaster, they didn't play in larger markets beyond Argentina, including Latin America more broadly, Spain, U.S. Hispanic, the Middle East and Africa, all of which have high demand for Latin originated Telenovelas. ", "So, we spent the last year creating what we call our Latin orbit, combining Telefe's power and production capabilities with Viacom's global footprint to set Viacom up to be a true player in the global Spanish language content distribution business.", "We started increasing IP ownership of Telefe content by retaining majority rights including International distribution. And we consolidated our content sales teams to capitalize on Telefe's volume.", "While year one was really about laying the foundation for future growth, we expect to exceed the revenues generated by all but the largest well-established content studio players in 2018.", "Output hours have increased by 12% and we project overall content sales to increase by 70% this year. All of our Telefe network maintained its position as the number one free-to-air channel in Argentina and we anticipate growing overall operating for Telefe by 40% this year and we are just getting started. Our goal is to quickly become, one of the top creators and distributors of Spanish and Latin content in the world and we are already on a path to get there.", "I 'l now pass it over to Wade to take you through the numbers.", "Wade Davis", "Thanks, Bob and good morning. We're pleased to report our financial results for the December quarter of fiscal 2018. As we guided, we continue to experience short-term transitional impacts from the stabilization of our distribution base that are reflected in today's numbers. However, as Bob discussed, we have made meaningful progress on a number of important strategic initiatives since our last call and we are seeing more favorable trends and key metrics, such as our domestic Pay-TV subscribers.", "These actions in trends will lay the foundation for growth and revenue OI and EPS in the second half of 2018 and beyond.", "Before I speak to our adjusted results, I want to note that we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $103 million in the quarter, primarily due to the enactment of tax reform legislation. This amount principally consists of a reduction of our net deferred tax liabilities, partly offset by a one-time expense related to the transition tax on the deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.", "I am going to speak to the impact on both our book and cash taxes from tax reform, later in my remarks. But it is important to note that Viacom has been historically a full tax payer, with the overwhelming majority of its earnings in the U.S. Accordingly, we will be a significant beneficiary of these changes going forward.", "Now turning to our consolidated results. I would point you to slide four of our earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Total company revenue declined 8%, principally driven by fewer theatrical releases and legacy slate under performance at film and entertainment. Consolidated Media Networks revenue decreased slightly with the domestic affiliate declines more than offsetting strength in worldwide advertising and ancillary revenue growth.", "Turning to slide five. Our adjusted operating income declined 4% to $717 million. This reflects an improvement at film and entertainment and a decline of Media Networks. Media Networks' decline was driven by the previously mentioned revenue decline, combined with marketing and content expenses associated with the January 18 launch of the Paramount Network.", "Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 reflects the lower effective tax rate from tax reform and lower interest expense from our continued reduction of debt.", "Turning to our segment results, slide six of our earnings presentation provides an overview of our Media Networks segment. Worldwide Media Networks revenues for the quarter were $2.6 billion, driven by strong international performance offset by domestic declines.", "Domestic revenues decreased 6% to $1.9 billion, while international revenues increased 18% to $631 million.", "On an organic basis, absent of five percentage point favorable foreign currency impact and a six-percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenues would have grown 7% in the quarter.", "Worldwide advertising revenues increased 1% and ancillary revenues were up 5%, while affiliate revenues declined 4%. Adjusted operating income declined by 7% to $913 million owing to domestic revenue performance as well as higher ad, promotion and original programming expense associated with the launch of Paramount Network.", "Including the pre-launch expenses, aggregate programming and SG&A expense increased 1% and 6% respectively. In line with the guidance, we provided last quarter, domestic affiliate revenues decreased 8%, reflecting subscriber declines as well as rate reset associated with our successful efforts to stabilize our distribution base.", "Domestic advertising revenues in the quarter declined 5% percent due to lower linear impressions, partially offset by higher pricing and robust growth in digital ad revenue.", "Our expectations for domestic affiliate revenue for fiscal 2018 have improved since we last provided guidance. I am happy to report that we expect full year domestic affiliate revenues to decline at the low end of mid-single-digits, an improvement of approximately 200 basis points from our previous guidance.", "Our improved outlook is based on the earlier than anticipated reinstatement of subscribers and accelerating growth at our virtual MVPD partners. In terms of seasonality, we anticipate that the domestic affiliate revenues in both the March and June quarters will decline in-line with the full year rate of decline, while the September quarter should decline in the low single-digits.", "We expect that the momentum we gain in the back half of 2018 will set us up to return to domestic growth as we get into fiscal 2019, and benefit from rate escalator that lags [ph] the one-time impact of rate resets. ", "In the March quarter, we see sequential improvement in domestic ad sales with declines in the low to mid-single-digit. We expect performance to improve steadily and sequentially over the remainder of the year reaching positive growth in the fourth quarter, this will be driven by ratings improvement we expect from new original programming coming on air, greater carriage benefits from improved distributor penetration and accelerating contributions from digital and dreadful [ph] initiatives.", "Lastly, we had a strong quarter on our media networks ancillary business, reflecting our push into adjacent businesses that leverage our core brands and IP. For the quarter, domestic ancillary revenues grew 8% to $85 million, critically claimed a successful launch of SpongeBob Musical as well as higher gaming revenues with a primary driver of growth from the quarter.", "We expect ongoing benefit from our diversification efforts and anticipate continued growth from this line of business over the course of the year.", "Now turning to international media networks on slide seven. Performance continued to be strong with 18% growth in revenue and strong double-digit growth in operating income contribution. International affiliate revenues increased 18% driven by organic growth as well as the five percentage points favorable impact from foreign currency. ", "Advertising revenues increased 22%, absent of five percentage point favorable impact from foreign currency and a 10-percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe, organic international advertising revenues would have been up 7%.", "This organic performance reflects continued strength in Europe. As Bob mentioned, international is pacing ahead of our original plan and will continue to be an important engine of growth for Viacom.", "For the balance of this fiscal year, we see opportunities for enhanced growth in affiliate revenues and expect full-year growth to improve to low double-digit, even growth in Latin America and our extended and expanded India JV licensing agreement. International ad revenues are expected to continue to be strong with growth in the low to mid-teens for fiscal 2018. ", "We now expect the full year growth rate for worldwide programming expense to be in the low single-digits, as we continue to invest in our flagship networks of benefiting from a shift in mix to non-scripted programming and from leveraging our content across multiple platforms and multiple networks on a worldwide basis.", "Given the timing of shows coming on air, we expect programming expense growth to be weighed for the June quarter. Given the momentum that's materializing in the performance of our growth initiatives, including advanced marketing and advertising solution, live events, and new digital experiences, we will be increasing our associated investments to fuel our second half of 2018 and beyond revenue growth. ", "Accordingly, we anticipate that worldwide distribution and other expenses will grow double-digits for the full year.", "As Bob noted, we've also made progress on our initiatives to grow share margins and profitability in our core businesses. Earlier this week, we took initial steps on our plans to reinvent our cost base and we're on track to realized cost savings of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2018, and we project hundreds of millions of dollars additional run rate savings, most of which will be realized by fiscal 2019, and will drop to the bottom line.", "It is important to note that none of our cost reinvention strategies are targeted at programming expense. We continue to invest to grow the success of our flagship networks.", "Taking all together, we see upside and media networks full-year adjusted operating income, as we benefit from both improved outlook for affiliate revenues and from improved international profitability. ", "Now turning to film and entertainment on slide eight of our earnings presentation. Although the performance of the films from the legacy slate was disappointing, we are extremely bullish on Paramount's continued execution of its turnaround strategy, the build-out of its 2019 slate and ramping up of TV production.", "In the quarter, revenues were down 28% to $544 million, reflecting the under performance of the legacy slate and fewer theatrical releases. Adjusted operating income improved $50 million to a loss of $130 million in the quarter. This was driven by lower operating expenses which were a function of the mix and number of theatrical releases, as well the studio's focus on more efficient marketing spend.", "For fiscal 2018, we continue to expect Paramount to generate a meaningful improvement in the bottom-line compared to fiscal 2017. However, given the soft performance of certain December quarter releases, this improvement will be somewhat less than we had originally anticipated.", "Turning to fiscal 2019, the slate will reflect the studio's new strategy and cost discipline. Accordingly, half of the 2019 slate will be co-branded films and six of the films have production budgets of $25 million or less. The 2019 slate looks great and we are excited for a new era at Paramount.", "Now moving below, the line, in terms of taxes, the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% under the new tax legislation, as compared to 30.8% in the prior year. For the full year, we are now forecasting a rate of approximately 25%, which compares to our prior guidance of 31%.", "Given our September fiscal year-end, our fiscal 2018 U.S. tax rate is a pro-rated rate. We will continue to refine this as we go through the year and get a better sense of domestic versus international profitability. From a cash tax perspective in fiscal 2018, we expect to see a benefit of approximately $200 million in the new tax law.", "The components of free cash flow are broken out on slide 12 of the earnings presentation. We had a cash use of $16 million, which compares to $113 million of operating free cash flow last year. The decline in operating free cash flow was principally driven by higher working capital utilization due to the ramp-up in film and TV production.", "The significant ramp in the size of Paramount slate from 10 films in 2018 to 16 films in 2019 will drive incremental working capital consumption for the year, which we expect to more than offset the cash tax benefits from tax reform.", "Since we announced our strategic plan a year ago, including our commitment to reduce leverage and maintain investment grade metrics, we have made meaningful progress, reducing our gross debt by approximately $3 billion or 23%. During the quarter, we used our excess cash to redeem over $1 billion of senior notes and debentures.", "Accordingly, at quarter end, we had $10.2 billion of total debt outstanding and cash of $394 million. Our debt was principally fixed rate with a weighted average cost of under 5%. If you take into consideration, the equity credit, we received from S&P and Fitch on our hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter end was $9.5 billion. And we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to delever over the course of fiscal 2018, including using our excess free cash flow to redeem debt.", "Wrapping up, we've accomplished a lot over the past year, having stabilized our operations and implemented new initiatives to drive long-term growth. We see a return to growth in the back half of the year, with upside in domestic affiliate revenues, international operations and our media networks cost structure.", "The negative impacts of the Paramount's legacy slate are largely behind us and we're looking forward to welcoming in a new era at the studio with the fiscal 2019 slate. We are extremely pleased with our progress and believe that the execution of our strategic initiatives will continue to deliver results.", "And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Bob.", "Robert Bakish", "Thank you, Wade. In closing, now roughly 14 months into our journey, to revitalize and reinvent Viacom, we couldn't be more proud of the progress we've made and more energized and excited about the opportunity ahead.", "We believe in our ability to execute and we believe in our asset mix, which is compelling and includes world-class production capabilities that continue to build on one of the largest and most powerful libraries across television, film and now digital maintenance.", "This content engine powers a broadly distributed set of Viacom branded services that are market leaders with the audiences they serve, and it feeds a growing ecosystem of partner platforms. Within that, we own one of just a handful of Hollywood studios one on a clear path to regaining its iconic status across film and television and a truly powerful International creative, distribution and monetization infrastructure which continues to grow rapidly.", "We also see a broad opportunity set including potentially game-changing mobile distribution B2C advanced advertising and valuable extensions across consumer products and experiences. And we're on a clear path to unlock all of them.", "Behind all of it we have a strong team and reenergize company culture and in an incredible set of creative advertising distribution and broader commercial partners whom we thank for working with us every day and with whom we look to do more.", "Thank you for your time and support. We look forward to updating you as our journey continues. And now, we'll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JP Morgan.", "Alexia Quadrani", "Hi, thank you. Just a couple of questions first can you provide a bit more color on the recent management changes at the media network specifically Nickelodeon and then just staying on Nickelodeon, what can be done if anything to improve ratings there, it seems like your program is really strong, but it's more of an issue if you were spending less time on your TV. I guess how fast can digital ramp and are you forecasting ratings improvement at Nick in order to get back to the positive ad revenue growth you would achieve at the end of the year?", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. Thanks, Alexia. So, first of all there has been no change in leadership at Nickelodeon, but in light of media speculation and kind of confusion on this matter, I'd like to clarify a few points. ", "Sarah Levy has been promoted to a newly created position as COO of Viacom Media Networks. That means we're bringing all our media network shared services under one structure and to be clear, this is about the shared support structure, it is an extension of the responsibility Sarah has held for the last year and that extension is to BET and to Nickelodeon. ", "-->", "Sarah and each of the brand Presidents will continue to report to me and as with our other efforts. The intent here is to streamline our structure, break down silos and ensure we are as efficient and agile as we can be.", "[Author:G]", "-->", "[Author:G]", "-->", "[Author:G]", "Now, on the Nickelodeon side, it's true we've had some rating softness at Nick and we're actively working to address it in two parallel paths one on television and one beyond television.", "So, first the television point. Truth be told it's not the first time we've seen softness at Nick and we've turned it around and Seema and her team are very focused on this. We have a robust slate of about 400 premier episodes coming up and those 400 episodes are across 15 series that are across the board strong. And we will be supplementing that with some incremental stunting and marketing.", "And just to give you an example, we debut a new series last week, Hunter Street, it's a serialized Novella and that show built each day. So, a lot of work going on the TV rating side and despite some of the headwinds with the parts, we feel good about our trajectory as the year plays out. ", "But we are also working aggressively to build to your point our non-TV impressions, this includes ramping up our social video strategy, particularly through VDS, where we see a significant opportunity to capture share and add dollars.", "It also includes continuing to grow Naagin, there we're going to add the power patrol franchise, that's something that hasn't been available on Naagin, and obviously is a worldwide hit as well as adding more educational content and supporting all of that with some increased marketing.", "Finally, there is the live event side, we talked about it SpongeBob, the Musical and International property called SLIMEFEST which is coming to the U.S. this summer.", "So, a lot of work going on at Nickelodeon and I am feeling very good about what the team is doing there. Also, worth touching on Nick at Night since that's the back half of Nickelodeon, there we had some ratings of softness in the quarter two.", "However, we have recently made three programming moves there bringing Two and a Half Men and The Goldberg's, which are two very strong series to Nick at Night and then also doing some things with movies, a couple of night a week. And as we have done that we have seen demand [ph] ratings already start to move in the right direction.", "So, lot of attention on this area, but again I feel good about everything we have underway.", "Operator", "All right. Thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of John Janedis of Jefferies.", "John Janedis", "Thank you. You guys touched on this a bit but as you know the market has been nervous about your domestic distribution and affiliate growth, so can you just talk a little more about your confidence level and the improvement and to what extent that hinges on either the entertainment path launch for some sort of new deal with a Virtual MVPD?", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. So, John look, we really have a multi-part strategy in the distribution side, which encompasses the MVPD universe, the VMVPD universe and unlocking the next wave of opportunity, particularly in mobile. So, let me touch on each.", "As you know, 2017 was really a year of transforming and stabilizing our relationships in the MVPD space, there you saw us implement a new strategy which is more relationship driven and bring incremental value to the table, beyond licensing, linear fee, putting more in the on-demand space, dense advertising partnerships and in some cases, co-production relationships.", "That strategy is clearly working for us. And as we said before through those efforts we renewed or extended half of our sub-base. And worth noting that we have no significant MVPD renewal on the near-term horizon.", "So, feeling very good about that and I would also remark that all that was done at a time where our flagship strategy really wasn't effectuated yet and we hadn't begun to see the audience improvements that we're now seeing.", "So, as we go into longer-term renewals, which again there is no renewals on the near-term horizon. We're also going to benefit from the stronger product line, which I think is key. Then there is a VMVPD space, there we represented on the two largest by far OTT platforms, those are DIRECTV Now and Sling, and as I remarked earlier, there we're seeing nice growth in fact it's turning out to be more of a driver for the overall category that we had initially contemplated, so we feel great about that.", "We did launch with Philo, that's still in its shake-down [ph] phase, hasn't gone to its marketing phase. So that should yield more benefit in the future. And we continue to have conversations with other players in this space.", "Finally, mobile that's really the next wave of opportunity. We are in conversations with multiple carriers literally as we speak in the U.S. and I think again I'd point to Telefonica as an example of the future because that is really a great deal for us and we'll have significant benefits.", "So, a lot going on this space, but I feel very good about our trajectory far better than I felt this time last year.", "Wade Davis", "Just one thing I'd like to underscore to that John you said, you asked if the improved guidance that we laid out hinges on any incremental virtual MVPD launch, the answer is that it doesn't any incremental virtual MVPD progress that we make and any sort of domestic mobile product that we bring to market like the Telefonica product that we announced that would be incremental upside, beyond the upside that we already guided to.", "John Janedis", "Thanks Wade. That's helpful. And then one quick thing Bob, there has been a lot of noise around the health of the ad market, given the audience fragmentation, so when you speak to the return to growth how broad of ratings improvement do you need to get there and get there and does that assume that you can get to industry like growth because that's something you really haven't done in a while probably a few years? And I guess related to that what is the contribution from digital?", "Wade Davis", "Yeah. Look, the softness that we had in domestic ad sales this quarter was a function of linear impression decline, which in turn was some linear rating softness principally at Nick. But it was also driven by the gaps in distribution that we had in the quarter.", "It's important to note that those gaps as Bob said in his remarks have now been filled with Suddenlink carriage fully penetrated in the achievement of full penetration on Charter's most likely distributed tier.", "So, having accomplished that, that's going to add a couple points of domestic ad sales growth going forward, so that is obviously something that underscores our confidence.", "With respect to your digital question that's the place where we're seeing great momentum as you know. We have some of the strongest advanced ad sales capabilities in the marketplace. We saw nearly 40% growth over the prior year's quarter in our advanced marketing and solutions business. So that's also a place that we see momentum ramping over the course of the year.", "And we further bolstered the capabilities in advanced, our advanced marketing solutions business with the recent acquisition of WHOSAY which brings us substantial incremental capacity in our network branded entertainment and solutions.", "And then we also announced VidCon, VidCon is another place where we grow out our capacity in experiential marketing there are big domestic event is in June so that brings great capacity online in that category to supplement the growth that we are seeing in things like the BET Experience, Clusterfest and now the SLIMEFEST coming online for our experiential business.", "So, the return to growth is actually really driven by a pretty broad portfolio of initiatives all of which we have pretty strong visibility into and it starts on the head start that we get going into this quarter with the penetration that's kind of head of what we had initially expected, so that's why we are confident in the sequential and consistent growth over the course of the year and the return to growth in the fourth quarter.", "John Janedis", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield of BTIG.", "Rich Greenfield", "Hi, thanks for taking the question, actually I have two. One just philosophical, I guess for Bob. I realize you are not going to talk about CBS given Jim's comments at the opening\\, but we had the Disney-Fox transaction last quarter obviously discoveries in the process of buying scripts, which I know you were interested in as well, maybe if you could just talk about scale, do you need more scale or not even do you need, how would more scale help Viacom and especially when you think about Paramount, there is a lot of noise about Sony right now and other studios that might become available, ", "Wondering how you think about your appetite for, if the Disney Studio isn't that scale and neither Fox, it would seem to me that Paramount definitely needs more scale through other studio acquisitions and just how do you think about that?", "And then just the second question, Wade touched on the Paramount Television business, obviously the film slate you were left with is the films slate, but it's obviously disappointing, but when you think about the TV side of the business, it seems like that's a business that doesn't get a lot of focus wondering where are you in terms of earnings on an annual basis on the TV side of the film, of the studio and how you see that progressing and becoming more meaningful over the next couple of years.", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. Thanks, Rich. So, I'll take the first part. Look, there is a lot going on in the industry, there is a lot of conversation about scale but through that noise, let me reiterate we are excited about the progress we're making, our assets mix and our competitive position as we execute against our strategy to enhance shareholder value. ", "And I want to highlight, international and Paramount are key points of differentiation and advantage for Viacom. We do see a clear path to organic growth through growing share and margins in our core business, accelerating our participation in next-generation platforms and solutions and diversifying into related businesses with synergies and we talked about that. ", "All that said, we will, of course, continue to look at M&A and other partnership opportunities, because you can get benefits to scale off and without actually acquiring a company, we'll do so in a disciplined manner and look at ways we can potentially accelerate our strategy execution and create value. ", "Two recent examples of that are WHOSAY and VidCon both which are essentially announced in the last week and both which clearly accelerate our strategy in terms of capabilities, in terms of top-line, top-line growth and in terms of value for our partners. ", "On the Paramount side, it's a highly valuable asset. I am thrilled with the leadership team under Jim Gianopulos and the slate they put together and quite frankly, the creative thinking they have, because they are not looking at the business in the same old way, they are also thinking about other things they can do, and I would highlight that this fast Disney transaction should have come to pass, but even in this sort of unknown stage it's actually increasing the value of Paramount and there's plenty of people out there who are coming to Paramount every day wanting to do business with that and believing in the potential of this iconic studio. So again, we're overwhelmingly focused on organic execution and we see a lot of potential ahead, Wade the second part?", "Wade Davis", "Yeah, with respect to Paramount TV that's been a huge success story in terms of when it's going to start contributing meaningfully to profitability that will be in 2019 we expect that business to be significantly over $400 million in revenue in 2019 and as we reached as we go into its first year of profitability it should be operating at or above 10% margin.", "It's important to note that that's a biz but all of that is achieved within just under three years of having launched that business. It's also important to underscore the strategic positioning of Paramount TV within the overall portfolio mix so all the financial permit side just described is really been driven by product it's being licensed by third parties.", "But there are critical synergies with respect to the Viacom networks where we have either five shows on air or in late phases of development to fuel our flagship brands and then the last point I would just note that Bob actually hit this a little bit in his remarks but having these content creation capabilities at such a premium level is one of the things that's really been able to allow us to deepen and expand our MVPD partnerships who are looking for exclusive premium content as part of their mix to drive penetration and retention so Paramount TV is a huge success story in one that not only is going to contribute meaningfully to our financial growth but it is also a critical strategic asset for us.", "Robert Bakish", "And I would just say look at the product, go watch the Alienist and when Jack Ryan comes out watch it. It is and we're just putting out the incredible product and it's really part of bringing that iconic studio back.", "Rich Greenfield", "And maybe just give us a sense of how diversified in terms of who you're producing for I don't think everyone realizes how live that that array of partners is?", "Robert Bakish", "Yeah, great point Rich, thank you. Look, we're producing for in-house networks, things like School of Rock for Nickelodeon, we have a number of projects in development for the Paramount network including first Wide Club - in fact, one at Paramount we're also as part of this Telefe conversation looking at creating an English language show in parallel to what are the Novellas down there a very attractive economics.", "In addition to in-house clients back to Paramount we're producing four call it traditional Cable Networks like the Turner Networks with Alienist as an example. We're producing for kind of new age networks, Catch-22 is for Hulu, Jack Ryan is for Amazon, so again and then Wade mentioned in the context of our Charter renewal we have a co-production relationship with them. So, this asset plays in a variety of configurations and is really part of the value creation that you began to see, and we'll continue to see ahead.", "Rich Greenfield", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.", "Benjamin Swinburne", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions I want to ask you about the Telefonica deal in Latin America and also your direct-to-consumer plans. We were obviously familiar with the traditional distribution model can you put a little more sort of color on what a mobile agreement looks like how that might translate into other relationships in that region or globally, you mentioned it's per month per sub to those economics tend to look sort of similar to a television deal or anything you can help us to sort of size that or think about the opportunity to build off of that?", "And then direct-to-consumer a lot of the media company is moving down this pass, when you think about launching something by the end of this fiscal year can you tell us a little bit about whether that would be a U.S. or global launch how much content you might be able to bring to there and also is there any impact at all in your existing NDP relationships where you would - theory start competing with them a little bit?", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. So, let me get the first part on your Telefonica question. Again, this is a Latin America deal, it is about Telefonica rolling out five of our brands MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Junior, Comedy Central, what we call Paramount Channel XUS to be movie star play platform for their subscribers. It is Pan-Latin America, so it is not just one country, we build off an existing relationship we haven't with Telefonica in Latin America, there were also a Pay-TV distributor or MVPD, but this is a mobile complemented act. It is a sense, revenue per sub economics which are comparable to Pay-TV rates and it's really the first and what we believe will be a series as many, where we unlock that platform to drive incremental reach for our brands and of course incremental monetization.", "It's worth noting that we're in numerous conversations similar to this all around the world and as I indicated we're in a set of conversation with multiple carriers in the U.S. And if you think about it this is the point that upends the whole argument with a client of Pay-TV. Because mobile is the most ubiquitous platform in the world and mobile subscribers outnumber Pay-TV subscribers by many, many, many multiples there are literally billions of them out there.", "The business the mobile business highly commoditized and competitive and carriers are looking for differentiation and there is just enormous road ahead and therefore, I'm thrilled to be talking about Telefonica but it's really the tip of the iceberg.", "Wade Davis", "So, I mean in terms of B2C as we said in our remarks we are not yet prepared to fully announce the offering but we're very confident that we're going to be in a position to do so soon and then as we said launch it within the fiscal year. What I can say is that it's going to be significant and it's also going to be differentiated from what's in the marketplace today.", "You asked about U.S. versus global initially it's going to be rolled out in the U.S., in terms of the amount of content that it's going to have, it's going to have tens of thousands of hours of content that cut across the library we have on a global basis. And it's important to note one of the reasons that we are able to do this is that we've chosen to curtail the amount of content that we license into third-party B2C experiences that the decision that we have made when Bob rolled out his strategic plan last year and although that had some short-term pain for us because unlike some of our competitors we've not been able to get the short-term revenue kick from licensing to third party SVOD.", "It's really important that we've kind of built in that library to be able to use for our own strategic purposes and fuel offerings like this. In terms of the impact on our MVPD community, it's going to be a fundamentally different product and in fact at least one of our MVPD partners is looking at incorporating this into their broader product as an important complement to their offerings.", "[Author:G]", "So, you should assume that we are really putting all of Viacom's assets against this so not only the content library that I talked about but we're also going to leverage the power of our brands and the audience in activating the audience that they already have leadership positions in and kind of the important categories of kids and family, you can music comedy African-American and urban and also the general entertainment presence that we have in our building with Paramount, Paramount TV and now the Paramount Network and then also we're going to leverage our ad sales force we broadly acknowledged to have the leading advanced ad sale capability in the television landscape.", "We have relationships with the world's largest advertisers. So, those are some of the at that when you think about Viacom bringing it's kind of full power to bear on launching something really different in the marketplace.", "Probably the last thing that, that's important to just to mention is that although we're able to leverage all of these assets and that's kind of an important tailwind and platform for us to build on. It is going to require some investment. But I do want to really underscore that any investment that we are going to make in this business is already embedded in our guidance.", "Robert Bakish", "I just want to add one thing to Wade's remarks which is you asked what MVPD, we do not view this as an MVPD substitute product there has been a recent example in the marketplace, where someone had a substitute product and an MVPD, therefore, chose not to carry them anymore we view this very much as MVPD complement product.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "And I know that sounds cryptic and we are going to have to leave it at that until we announce it but MVPDs MVMVPDs for that matter are critically important for Viacom we've done a lot of work to build our relationships with them in the last 14 months we continue to do that work, they continue to be very important to us. And so, this is a product that we think works in that ecosystem.", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Michael Nathanson of Moffett.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks, Bob. I have two quick ones, one on strategy and one Wade in the working capital. So, Bob two things just walk us through the rationale to sell that Indian stake to what percent and what does the change of structure provide in terms of growth opportunities ahead and then walk us through also the Cloverfield decision to sell that movie and do you ever see to start moving to maybe work for higher model for films and then for Wade what's the normalized working capital change for you guys, it's I know how - is but when we think about modeling working capital for Viacom what do you think about kind of a normalized year?", "-->", "[Author:G]", "Robert Bakish", "Sure. So, let me flip that around on, let me take Cloverfield first and I'll throw it to Wade since he was on the ground in India and did that deal for the India piece. So, on Cloverfield, let me start by saying this was a unique situation that we thought was the right fit for the franchise. It allowed us to take advantage of an attractive audience and really create some pretty compelling economics.", "So, while we continue, now also important that we're going to continue to focus the vast majority of our releases on traditional theaters and we see a great opportunity there to take share driven by our 19 Slate and beyond. But given our production capabilities and the landscape, we're going to continue to deliver broadly and creatively for opportunities to create additional value for Paramount. So again, I think Cloverfield is an interesting story, it's a bit of a one-off but it's an illustration of creative thinking and ways to create more value.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "Wade Davis", "So, in terms of Viacom18 venture this is something that we're, this is a business we're incredibly proud of, it's been a huge success, it kind of bare us reminding people that little under a decade ago we formed this venture and had diminished revenue and pretty material losses. And today it's over $500 million of revenue and meaningfully profitable, it's one of the top three diversified media companies in India. It today has the number one Hindi language general entertainment channel but it's business is also span a bouquet of regional languages in channels, feature film business that's had a great deal of success in the last couple of quarters as well as enabled our business that's one of the leaders in the marketplace there. So, it's been a huge success story.", "Now in terms of the transaction, we did this was really it was driven by the strategic desire to really take advantage of our partners' position in the marketplace and their affiliated Jio platform. The Jio platform is something that is really transformed the Indian market, media marketplace over the past year where it's gone from nothing to over a 160 million subscribers in just over a year and so by allowing our partner to take really kind of day-to-day operational control over this business it's going to facilitate a much deeper integration of our business into the Jio platform and we think drive a real inflection point against the already strong growth of the business.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "And I think there's a couple of other points just worth for mining folks which is number one, this business was never a consolidated asset so the sale of 1% and giving day-to-day operating control to our partner isn't something that has any impact on our financial statements whatsoever. What does have an impact on our financial statements is the fact that we extended and enhanced our license agreement with Viacom18 and that's one of the thing that not only allows us to benefit from the top line growth of the business as we accomplished the strategic objectives that I just described but it also immediately has a material impact on Viacom International media networks financial performance and that's one of the things that fuel that's going to fuel the upside that Bob referenced in his announcement, immediately in 2018 and also beyond.", "So, it's a great transaction, we're really excited about it, kind of well beyond a couple of billion-dollar value that it picked today and having sold only 1% we still retain the vast majority of our upside.", "Quickly because we've got to wrap up in terms of working capital changes, so we do have some growth in working capital consumption this that's really driven by the ramp up in production for the 19-film slate, where we're moving from 10 films this year to 16 films next year. We're ramping Paramount TV production and then a lot of the investments that we're making to continue to fuel the flagship networks.", "So, although we're going to see some cash tax upside from tax reform this year it's going to be more than offset by the growth in working capital changes. Going forward that's going to, you'll see that kind of lap itself and unwind so you'll see continue to see strong growth in operating free cash flow going forward beyond 2018.", "Michael Nathanson", "Thanks, Wade.", "Robert Bakish", "Okay. We want to thank everyone for joining us for the earnings call.", "-->", "[Author:G]", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in the Viacom first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.
