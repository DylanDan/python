Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance.", "We believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially, are in the forward-looking statements detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Security and Exchange Commission.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and continued strong growth in our device platforms. We also saw the start of a steady ramp our latest mask technologies.", "For the call today, I will review top level financial results, outline some regional highlights and discuss key announcements this quarter. Then, I will hand the call over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in further detail.", "We achieved strong device sales due to our leadership in digital health and connected care. The number of patients managed on the AirSolutions platform and the number of daily uses of our Brightree platform continue to grow rapidly. This quarter, we announced that we have reached a milestone with more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our cloud-based physician and provider solution called AirView. We have well over 2 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers and patients like never before.", "Midway through the quarter, we commenced the launch of our new AirFit range of mask, the AirFit N20 nasal mask and the AirFit F20 full face mask. Both of the products leverage new step change technology called Infinity Seal that provide significant advances in fit and comfort to the patients. Earlier this month, at the JPMorgan healthcare I announced that we had received FDA clearance for the ResMed AirMini, our world leading, travel friendly, sleep app technology. I will talk more about that a little later.", "At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-over-year basis in Q2. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share or EPS was $0.73 on a non-GAAP basis.", "We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring an appropriate investment in both R&D and SG&A, so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across our global markets.", "Now for some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree and 13% growth in devices. Device growth was particularly remarkable given that we were up against a 24% year-over-year comparable.", "The mask and accessories category in the Americas grew 4% in the quarter. This is up sequentially and reflects the fact that our sales team that received products around Thanksgiving timeframe has started showing the new technology to physicians and providers. There is clearly a long way to go in the ramp of these products in Q3, Q4 and into fiscal year 2018.", "Growth in devices was driven by the continued support for the AirSense 10 systems by our customers. These are powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions software platform, including the myAir patient engagement app that has over 1,000 new patients signup every day.", "We achieved good growth in our respiratory care device platforms in the Americas, particularly our cloud-connected life support ventilation platform called Astral. We earned strong growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions this quarter, primarily driven by Flow Generator sales, with some outstanding performance from our combined Curative and ResMed China businesses.", "We have now completed the earn out and the integration is going very well. As we enter the Chinese New Year, we have truly formed one ResMed China team with one vision, one mission, two brands and many and varied customer channels, the thing is really coming together well.", "Mask, accessory and other sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were down year-over-year due to a couple of factors, one we had some international licensing revenue from the comparable quarter a year ago in the region and two, the N20 and F20 were only released in a few countries, and as we know uptake of new masks is a lot slower in EMEA and APAC then the U.S. market. We expect this mask category to return to public growth in EMEA and APAC as we continue to launch the N20 and F20.", "Feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers on the fit range and comfort of the N20 and F20 are very positive. This is a great indicator for stronger mask growth in Q3, Q4 and into FY 2018. Looking at our Software-as-a-Service revenue Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model in the low-to-mid teens.", "We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality into the AirSolutions portfolio. We are truly creating end-to-end software solutions for our customers and Brightree is achieving strong double-digit growth, with high levels of customer's satisfaction and customer workflow efficiencies gains.", "Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett.", "In the first horizon of growth which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable products, catalyzed by digital health and connected care solutions.", "We launched our new AirFit F20 full size masks and our new AirFit N20 nasal masks in the second quarter. The Infinity Seal technology is a step change in comfort for patients and fit ranges of 97% to 99% of patient populations approving a winning value proposition with respiratory clinicians. We are seeing exceptionally strong demand for the N20 and F20 products and for some of the masks SKUs demand is in fact outpacing supply as we ramp up our production capabilities for these new technologies. We will continue to ramp up our supply and expect to be out pacing demand as we go through Q3 and into Q4.", "At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier this month, we announced the FDA clearance of the world's most CPAP called the ResMed AirMini, it's a tiny portable travel PAP with all of ResMed's best in class comfort features. AirMini is intended to be a secondary device for travel, and it truly compliments our world leading AirSense 10 platform.", "AirMini is an amazing technology and we expect to launch this product commercially before the end of the fiscal year. I have personally been using a prototype of the ResMed AirMini for over 12 months. It has traveled with me to Asia, all over Europe and throughout the Americas. For those listening to this call, who may also be CPAP patients feel free to go to airmini.resmed.com and signup. We\u2019ll make sure that you\u2019re amongst the first to know when the product is fully launched through our Homecare Channel Partners.", "We continue to lead in the field of connecting care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have reached as I said earlier 1 billion nights of sleep data and are focusing on algorithms to convert big data into actionable information. The ultimate goal is to unlock even more value for physicians, providers, payers and most importantly for patients. This quarter, we announced results from a European study published by PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzing data from more than 23,000 patients in Germany and the UK.", "The study shows that myAir patients when compared to controls, used their CPAP devices for longer durations and have significantly higher adherence rates. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea vertical, we are extending this cloud based coaching algorithms to our ventilation and oxygen technologies, watch this space.", "This is a great transition for the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We know that COPD is the number three cause of death and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the western world. The spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our ResMed portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes for patients with this debilitating disease. Connected Care in ventilation can reduce costs and improve patient outcomes in COPD and beyond.", "We continue to see portable oxygen concentrators or POCs as an important addition to our spectrum of respiratory care products. Our integration of the Inova acquisition has focused on quality improvements to the current Activox POC platform. We are gradually ramping the launch of this technology to our global sales team as we continue to improve quality and functionality of the product. We will ultimately add cloud connectivity to our POC platform which will help drive adherence for patients, fleet management for providers and activity tracking for physicians.", "Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of long term opportunities including sleep help and wellness as well as clinical adjacencies, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Another key area of horizon three growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, health care analytics, care co-ordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice.", "In the area of sleep help and wellness we are making good progress with our new joint venture called Sleep Score Labs with capital investments from ResMed, Pegasus Capital and Dr. Mehmet Oz. We started the partnership last quarter with an entire Dr. Oz show dedicated to the field of sleep wellness. Dr. Michael Bruce and Dr. Oz leveraged the S+ by ResMed the world's first non-wearable sleep device and Smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep.", "The sleep awareness campaigning encompassed anonymous sleep data from a database with over one million nights of sleep. Sleep Score Labs calculated America's overall sleep score and Dr. Oz announced the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas earlier this month. Dr. Oz reported that people are not sleeping as well as they should, we're getting less than what the National Sleep Foundation recommends which is seven to eight hours plus of sleep. We are about one hour behind the minimum with around six hours of sleep.", "People say they're tired and people say they want to understand their sleep better. Sleep Score Labs will do just that, they will truly quantify sleep and help people objectively determine which sleep solutions are best for them.", "For ResMed this is about driving the importance of sleep awareness and sleep health. We will be helping people realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing at night or any shortness of breath day or night. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall health. We will continue to drive sleep health and sleep awareness and our ResMed brand as a leader in the field.", "Let me close with this, we are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017 including the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower cost for providers and improve outcomes for patients.", "We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep, so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers. We continue to bring out strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world.", "With that I will turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Right, thanks Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the second quarter fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted we had a solid quarter. Revenue for the December quarter was 530.4 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 18%. Excluding acquisitions in constant-currency terms organic revenue increased by 10% over the prior year quarter.", "Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $293 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $203.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $154.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $146.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 21%.", "Masks and other sales were $57 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms a decrease of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 17% for masks and other increased by 2% over the prior year quarter. Brightree revenue for the second quarter was 33.8 million, with growth on a prior year comparable basis continuing to track in in the low to mid-teens.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted impact of amortization for acquired intangibles, acquisitions related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring expenses and the release of the SERVE-HF accrual. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.", "Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP gross margin increased by 20 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. These were partially offset by product mix, typical declines in average selling prices, and unfavorable currency movement. Due to current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue be in the range of 58% to 60% for the balance of fiscal year 2017.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $139.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increased to 18%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, and in constant-currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.3% compared to 26% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for the balance of fiscal year 2017. This reflects expected marketing expenses associated with product launches and ongoing legal expenses.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $38.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior-year quarter, or on constant currency basis, an increase of 28%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 11% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2017.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was 11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 7.3 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was 10.8 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was 131.6 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 103.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was 76.7 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73, consistent with the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54.", "Note that our prior year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. Whereby we recorded a tax benefit of 5.1 million in Q2 FY16. In the current quarter, under the standard we recorded a tax expense of 25,000. Excluding this impacts non-GAAP earnings per share would have increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.", "Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted second quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1%. And looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%.", "During the quarter, we recognize restructuring expenses of 4.4 million associated with rationalization of our European R&D activities. Additionally, we recognize an expense of 10.1 million for additional contingent consideration associated with acuity acquisition. The additional accrual was the result of the business achieving performance milestones that result in the investment contingent consideration payable under the purchase agreement. Finally, we recognize an expense of 8.5 million is part of global settlement of all litigation between ResMed, BMC and 3B.", "Cash flow from operations was 119.9 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by modestly increase in net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 14.7 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled 27.7 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior year quarterly dividend.", "As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018. At December 31st, we had approximately 1.2 billion in gross debt and $380 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31st, total assets were 3.3 billion and net equity was 1.7 billion.", "And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue.", "Mariana, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.", "David Low", "If we could just start with the mask rollout. Mick, you mentioned that you've had some issues with keeping up with demand and you've also talked about the rollout into other countries outside the US. I was wondering if you could just expand on those two issues, and wondering particularly whether that production issue means that the rollout internationally might take a little longer.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question David. Look the patients and provide and clinician acceptance in the mask has been great. The Infinity Seal technology particularly and its ability to reach 97% to 99% of the patients that coming to a sleep lab or through a clinic. And so these acceptance has been great and certainly exceeding what we had thought it may be.", "And so what we\u2019re finding with the new production technology that we\u2019re using for this infinity sale is that, as we ramp across the different stock keeping units, that in some of those SKUs, we are not keeping up with very high demand, but as we look forward over Q3 and Q4 we will start to catch up and we will expect by certainly, the end of Q4, that we\u2019ll be well ahead of the demand for the product.", "Rob, do you want to add something on that?", "Robert Douglas", "I said, regarding the rest of the world rollout, the volumes in the U.S. are much larger than elsewhere in the world and we really don\u2019t see a big impact on the rest of the world rollout, that will continue slow and steady progress as we reported previously.", "David Low", "Great. Yes, looking at it obviously, it seems like a good problem to have if you can't keep up with demand. Just the other question I had, Brett, you mentioned in the SG&A commentary, you've given us guidance, which I think is above what we've just seen and I think you made a comment about legal expenses. Just wondering if that relates to the settlement that's already happened or are we talking about other ongoing legal expenses?", "Brett Sandercock", "No, that\u2019s really the ongoing legal expenses Dave, I mean, we're into, obviously, legal action with S&P, so that's not inexpensive.", "David Low", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Probably a follow-on call, sorry, follow-on question from David, just trying to get a bit more granular on the N20 series. Just the 4% mask growth you saw in the U.S., just if you're willing to characterize, was that mainly the N20, I guess, after a sort of flat growth elsewhere? And just also any feedback from the pilots that you guys ran on those masks?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Andrew. Well both the N20, which is mask, and F20, which is the full face mask are doing very well. They both have the Infinity Seal technology this year, single-layer technology that provides excellent fit and moment for patients, I personally wear a CPAP mask and the N20 is particularly comfortable for me, but those products are going very well and doing well in the U.S. market and that\u2019s what got us to the sequential uptick in the U.S. mask growth and we expect to, as we go through Q3 and Q4 and pick our production up to continue to grow quite strongly there and to turn back to a positive growth in EMEA and APAC.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Any new feedback from the pilot? Did it meet your expectations in terms of the way the DMEs are thinking about this mask ahead of other masks?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, certainly as the DME or HME home care providers, as we call them in Europe start to see this product, that fit range, fitting 97% to 99% of the patients that walk through the clinic has just been a real winning value proposition for the respiratory technicians. The N20 is the go to mask for nasal now for them. And the F20, we believe is a go to mask for them on full-face, and its early days in the rollout, the U.S. team got this at the weak of Thanksgiving, they\u2019ve really only had half a quarter and one with the bunches of Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, but we do expect as we look for Q3 and looks to Q4 and start to ramp the production up, that\u2019ll be a slow steady gradual increase in both the U.S. and in other regions through Q3, Q4 and of course beyond FY2018. These technologies have a lot of legs.", "Andrew Goodsall", "That's great. And I just want to think of that 4% as a good lead indicator of the early success.", "Mick Farrell", "Correct.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Okay. That\u2019s great, really appreciated. Thank you.", "Operator", "Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Couple of things. You mentioned the impact of lower ASPs and mix on the expense structure. Could you expand upon that just a little bit?", "Mick Farrell", "[Multiple Speakers]. Brett, you want to take that?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Just on -- that was really truly that the gross margin year-on-year that kind of ASP product mix is probably the biggest one year-on-year, we\u2019re still seeing, well we\u2019re seeing that really strong device growth continuing and unfavorable FX impacts was quite a bit too. If you just look at it sequentially, Joanne, it was 60 basis points, but we had unfavorable FX of 40 basis points. So it was -- that was probably the drivers you look at on a sequential basis.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay. That's very helpful. Share repurchases, when are you likely to restart those, given your cash flow in the quarter? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, we\u2019re still of the view that we\u2019ll commence that in FY18.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay that\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it back. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with the question.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Brett. The first question is really what drove the acceleration in Americas devices and the number was pretty big. The question is, it sustainable and can your mix of new products and ASV offerings really keep that revenue growth profile for ResMed in the low double-digit or teens range?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question Margaret, it's Mick here. So we did have very strong growth in devices in the Americas, it's 13% on a constant currency basis. We think that was primarily fueled by AirSolutions, the portfolio of AirView and myAir capabilities to lower the labor costs for setting up a CPAP by 50%, 60% for a home care provider. Also the ability for engagement apps like myAir to drive adherence from previous industry standards of 50%, 60% up to 80%, 87% in some of the data that we have talked about publically.", "So we think all that comes together to drive good sustainable growth and that does of course include some of the growth in the respiratory care line, our Astral ventilation, our life support ventilation line. Look we talk in terms of the industry growing in the mid to high single digits. Clearly, we were taking some share in devices in this quarter and you know as we look forward we'd expect to see you know good mid to high single digit growth of the industry and we'd like to lead or beat that and clearly we beat that this quarter.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Okay and then maybe a similar question on the international side. Obviously you had strength international generator, so was there anything specific to this quarter? And then I hate to sneak one more in, but the constant currency of mask growth what was it excluding the licensing fees that you referenced at the beginning of the call?", "Mick Farrell", "Okay, I'll hand it to Rob to talk about international devices and licensee. ", "Robert Douglas", "Yes, so Margaret, the factors driving the international sales are similar to the ones driving the U.S. sales, just that the sort of the ramp has been different as the take out from the whole process of explaining AirView and getting the myAir going is a longer process. Then the other really significant thing in the rest of the world data, outside of the U.S. data is China had a big impact, and so we had a very strong quarter in China, really related to the teams getting together and our integration plan going really well. And the team all pulling together focusing on new channels, really getting the sleep business and also really driving our respiratory care business in China. And then of course you know the Q2 is sort of like the end of year in China, is traditionally a strong quarter for us.", "Mick Farrell", "The only thing I'd add to that, Rob, which I think is really good is that ASV turned from the post survey check where it was a headwind into a tailwind again. And so we're starting to see growth in ASV, not just in complex sleep apnea and central sleep apnea, but the pain management and in the U.S. in the PTSD category. So all that together, Margaret, is sort of what's one of the tailwinds driving those strong device numbers.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Matthew Taylor from Barclays Bank is online with a question.", "Matthew Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the question can you hear me okay?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, got you loud and clear Matthew.", "Matthew Taylor", "Okay great. So one question I wanted to ask is you announced the settlement of all your litigations with BG. And I just wanted to know if you could help us understand what the ongoing impact is going to be in terms of the licensing royalty revenue that you could see and the lower legal expense that you could have, now that you have this settlement.", "Mick Farrell", "I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Global General Counsel, Dave.", "Dave Pendarvis", "Thanks Matt, first of all we're really pleased with the settlement. We think that it is helping to validate the strength of our IP that we're now going to get paid royalty on sales in the U.S. by our competitor for the products that are covered by the deal. The reality is, those royalty streams will not likely be material to us going forward and you know that's fine. They don't have a large market share in the U.S. market. We don't expect that to change anytime soon. So we don't expect it to be material.", "Obviously there is a reduction in the ongoing litigation cost that were associated with that case and really a number of cases around the world, but as Brett mentioned earlier we continue to have really, frankly a larger case against F&P and some other ongoing legal expenses. So there still will be significant legal expenses going forward. But obviously one of the reasons you settle cases is to the avoid the further ongoing expense and that was one of the reasons that motivated us to reach this settlement with BMC that we did, but we're very pleased with it.", "Matthew Taylor", "Great and then just a follow up on an earlier question. I mean it's a little bit surprising that's late and kind of the flow gen launch to see such a big acceleration, was there any kind of stocking order or anything else that was abnormal that you would call out or was this just a good execution quarter?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, Matthew I think it was really about good execution. The value proposition of AirSolutions has shown itself to be very sustainable. It's a sustainable compelling value proposition for customers. When you're reducing the costs of therapy setup by 50% or 60%, it's just embedded -- becomes embedded into the work flow and just how our home care provider partners like to work, they like to work with the cloud-based system. They like to work with one that's lower costs and drives adherence.", "And so as Rob said there was some sort of good acceleration in China and some good sales of our China team running through the tape. But then globally we're seeing the AirSolutions platform have a really good impact and Astral as it comes into play and is now part of the cloud-based or cloud connected system, is getting some good traction as well. And then the third factor is ASV, the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology coming to a tailwind. So all that together has provided strong flow generator growth and we expect strong growth to continue. And obviously the rates will be what they'll be, but mid-single digits -- mid to high single-digits is what we see the market going at and again we'd like to meet or beat that.", "Operator", "Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.", "Sean Laaman", "I've a question on Brightree. So good revenue number there ahead of us. I was just wondering, Mick, if you could give us a sense of I guess some of the CPAP share dynamics and some of the resupply dynamics you've seen amongst new adopters of Brightree? That's the first question.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Sean, I think I'll hand that question over to Jim Hollingshead, who runs the Americas. I'll just start off with, yes the low to mid-teens growth from Brightree is strong, again it's a compelling value proposition for our home care providers, and they like it incorporated into their work flows. Jim, any further color with regard to ongoing resupply sales associated with Brightree?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yes, the Brightree platform, if you think of it from a point of view of the core sleep business is an extension of process automation. And so there's a lot of affinity between new Brightree customers and customers who are users of the AirSolutions platform and the data connection between the two of those platforms makes it much easier for them to continue do that. And so it's -- even though the two businesses have separate commercial teams, separate sales team out in the market they tend to reinforce each other in the market.", "Brightree customers tend to have a very good experience with ResMed sleep products and back and forth. And then the Brightree software platform for a resupply which is called Connect is getting increasing adoption in the market. It's very valuable for the customers who adopted it and it's very-very good for patients because it drives regular resupply for patients and they therefore have a better experience on therapy and that is a growing part of their offer.", "Sean Laaman", "Sure, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up when might we see the P20?", "Mick Farrell", "Sean, we don't talk about future pipelines to a great extent. We did open up a little bit on this call about the ResMed AirMini, the world's smallest travel seat CPAP that we got FDA clearance on, that was a public FDA clearance, but we won't be talking about the pipeline of future masks. But thank you for the question.", "Operator", "Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question.", "Will Dunlop", "Just firstly on pricing in the U.S. I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that you had gone early with customers in reducing price prior to the introduction of competitive bidding on 1 July. Not all customers, but some I remember you saying. Just wondering when you might cycle those price reductions and you might see maybe a more favorable pricing environment in the U.S.?", "Mick Farrell", "Will, I think you're referring to something maybe 18 plus months ago, where they were some changes around competitive bidding round two. So 18 almost, 24 months ago [Multiple Speakers] when there were some resets.", "William Dunlop ", "I'm referring to the latest round of competitive bidding. [Multiple Speakers].", "Mick Farrell", "So, okay. Well if it\u2019s related to that they know that what we\u2019ve being saying, which is the reality around the competitive bidding round three and round three national expansions, and the rebids going on now is that it\u2019s pretty steady pricing picture, in fact no step change at all. Industry normal price changes year-on-year in a steady pricing environment. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing a lot of competition amongst the innovation. Innovation in the masks and innovation in the cloud connectivity and connected care side. So intend complication for us and our competitors in masks and digital offerings. But in terms of price it\u2019s been a very steady environment last four, eight, plus quarters.", "William Dunlop ", "Okay. Thanks. And then could you just talk to demand for the AirSense in Europe please?", "Mick Farrell", "Sure. Rob, do you want to address?", "Robert Douglas", "We don\u2019t really break it out, but as I said before the value proposition around AirView and the connectivity is the same in European countries as it is in the U.S. It's just that some sort of the dynamics of how people understand the value and create the value is different and it takes -- has taken more time to build that up.", "In particular, in France, we had talk about, there was some legislation or some rules supporting that that was going to effectively create a differential reimbursement. So there was more reimbursement, the devices that were monitored wirelessly. And that was then knocked out in a court case, but subsequently that rule has been reversed and we\u2019re expecting sometime this year to see it become the norm that there will be that differential back in the French business and that, for example, in that one country, of all those many countries would help drive volume.", "Other than that, we continue to see the volume increases going on, the take up of myAir is strong and we continue to see that patients in Europe are very interested in getting their own data and using that to help their treatment and help improve their own health outcomes.", "William Dunlop ", "Okay. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the questions Will. ", "Operator", "Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question.", "Mike Matson", "I guess, I just wanted to start with your manufacturing operations. I think they are pretty much all outside the U.S. One, I want to know if that\u2019s correct, and two, how do you think you\u2019d be affected by some of these border tax proposals that the Republicans are talking about?", "Robert Douglas", "Listen Mike, currently we have a very strong global supply chain footprint that manufactures in many countries and we talk a lot about Singapore and Sydney as being major part to that supply chain. What we don\u2019t often talk about is that we do have manufacturing in the U.S. as well and our motor, ResMed motor technology subsidiary is based in the Los Angeles area. And we also manufacture some in the U.S. in our Atlanta facility. And so we\u2019ve actually got the capability to respond to what is needed on a tax basis, as needed and we'll keep any eye out and be flexible with it. Dave I think you had a comment?", "Dave Pendarvis", "Yeah Mike, its Dave here. Though I think the one thing we can all agree on about U.S. politics today is it's going to be hard to predict. There are a lot of -- there is a lot of discussion about tax reform and what that might mean and we'll just have to wait and see what the actual proposals are, and what the details are, and what gets implemented, when it gets implemented.", "As Rob said, we\u2019ve got opportunities to do things and frankly, if there become incentives to manufacture more in the U.S., clearly that could be an opportunity for us. We've got a lot of customers in the U.S., a lot of patients in the U.S. But we take care of all of our stakeholders, we look at what we do best for shareholders, what we do best for customers, what we do best for employees and take all those factors into account when we make our decisions. But it\u2019s going to be I think a few years for things to sort themselves out, and we\u2019ll obviously make the best decisions we can on the basis of whatever the details are.", "Mike Matson", "Okay. Thanks. And then just curios for AirMini, I think there is one other product out there that\u2019s big part of that segment of the market. So I was just wondering if you had a feel for how big that market is currently, I guess in the U.S. at least, if not globally?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question Mike. The current travel PAP is a very small niche segment and what our goal at ResMed as the global leader in sleep apnea therapy is to bring the world\u2019s smallest, the world's most comfortable, the world\u2019s quietest and most engaging travel CPAP to the market. And so we think we will actually expand on what is currently a very small travel CPAP niche and create a sizable segment of travel CPAP users that are willing to pay retail cash and work with our home care provides who access those products and really make it as part of their care so that you can have the same experience when you\u2019re traveling around the country, around the world as you do at home. So that\u2019s the goal of the ResMed AirMini and as we launch that between now and June 30, you'll see us talk about how we're going to drive awareness, create that niche and make sure that patients the world over have the opportunity to have ResMed therapy with them wherever they are.", "Mike Matson", "Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in? Just curious if the liquidation of AirStart devices had any kind of material impact on of your U.S. flow generator growth in the quarter.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll hand that over to Jim any thoughts on AirStart?", "Jim Hollingshead", "It is a very small part of sales in the quarter. Not material.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the questions Mike.", "Operator", "Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with the question.", "Suraj Kalia", "So, Mick, a couple of questions from my side. First, you just mentioned you're expecting AirMini to be cash-pay for customers, specifically from a travel perspective. Mick, can you give us some idea about how you'll stratify this market in terms of numbers in the U.S.? Just trying to get a sense -- obviously, you guys have a head start here also, how the numbers could play out? That would be one question.", "And the second question would be how do you all view a potential Tom Price confirmation as HHS had? Our checks obviously are that he's pro DME. Any color from you guys thinking perspective also would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Suraj. I\u2019ll take the second one first and then I\u2019ll hand to Jim maybe to talk a little bit about AirMini and we're looking at segmenting the cash-pay market and working with our provider, customers. But the second part first, Tom Price was a Congressmen from Georgia who spoke at the Mid Trade Conference in Atlanta last fall. And I don\u2019t think anyone in the room knew or thought that he might become HHS Secretary, but when he got off on the floor and made a very passionate speech about the importance of home care, importance of keeping patient's out of hospital, taken well care of in the home. He's an Orthopedic surgeon, I think he understand the economics of the broken sort of sick care system where patients are frequent fliers in the ICU and CCU with COPD and we believe also sleep apnea is a big impact on that.", "I think he will be a big supporter. And if he puts in place some of the policies that he was advocating for in behalf of the homecare industry as HHS Secretary, we think it could be beneficial for our industry. But look you know as Dave said earlier, there is a lot of things going on in Washington right now, a lot of change and we're going to wait and be ready to hopefully see some more homecare friendly policies out of Washington, but we'll wait till we see them and then we'll act on them. But that sort of the early take on Tom Price, I\u2019d say it's a positive for our industry.", "Jim, on the AirMini, thoughts?", "Jim Hollingshead", "On the AirMini, we see a couple of opportunities with the AirMini. One for patients and one for HME customers. Patients, we believe have a strong pent up demand for a good travel solution for CPAP. And right now there are some solutions on the market that we think are not up to snuff. We think our offer is going to be very superior and well actually as Mick was saying earlier, we'll grow demand in the category because patients really want to take our full featured CPAP with them when they travel. And so we see an opportunity for patients to have better care and more convenient life with their CPAP as they travel.", "For customers it's an opportunity because we know that our HME customers, especially in the U.S. are trying to grow their cash-pay business. There is more and more health care spend that's out of pocket in the U.S. because the way insurance is increasingly shifting the landscape. Our DME customers, HME customers are looking for and often exploiting quote, unquote, cash-payer out of pocket opportunities. We intend to take this product through our dealers which will allow them to service patients and that pent up need for a good travel PAP experience and also create a cash-paying opportunities to grow their businesses.", "Operator", "Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with the question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Just a couple on underlying device growth in the quarter and it sounded like there's some moving parts there. I'm just wondering if you have the combined contribution for Astral and Nova and ASV. And then maybe just a revisit on underlying sleep margins, where they sit today, just getting all the moving parts with pricing and mix versus Americas or U.S. and masks flow gens? And then one follow up question. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Right, Anthony, well look, the underlying device rate, we don\u2019t split up sleep versus respiratory care and then respiratory care down to ventilation and oxygen. But as you saw in the Americas, a really strong 13% constant currency growth in devices and in EMEA and APAC, very strong 21% with the global 17% growth. We think that growth is strong and sustainable, but there are elements, as we've said earlier with regard to China where there were some things that where sort of onetime and there were other more sustainable parts such as the AirSolutions platform and its ability to continue to drive AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 sales along those lines.", "But with regard to margins and as we look forward, I think other than the foreign exchange impact, it was pretty reasonably good quarter in terms of margins. Any color there Rob, you'd like to add?", "Robert Douglas", "Well, I think as I said some of the drivers around margins in the sleep have to do with product mix, so while machines grow stronger as the headwinds for margins, sales strong in the U.S. compared to our lower volume markets in Europe and in Asia will generally also be a headwind to margins as well.", "Offsetting that our efficiency improvements in our supply chain and as we really cranking the production for the AirSense 10 and in other products we see ongoing improvement and it\u2019s a continual headwind to our win rates, so we run neck and neck too. Brett, I don't know if you have any other comments?", "Brett Sandercock", "No, everyone thinks you've articulated it pretty well. I guess we try to take it all into account as best as we can and so we're still looking at the guidance of 58% to 60% and then it\u2019s just contingent on how the product meets geographic mix, FX plays out during the quarter.", "Anthony Petrone", "That's helpful. And then a follow-up would just be, did you quantify the benefit from China and then just any comments on the Cures Act, with that passing, obviously, that pushed out some of the reimbursement cuts, how does that play out? Our checks are suggesting there's sort of one-time payments that DMEs will get at some point in 2017, but that it could be scattered throughout the year. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Right, thanks Anthony, I think somehow you managed to get four questions in there, but we don\u2019t quantify the breakdown there. Rob was talking qualitatively to the curative ResMed China combination and its impact on the quarter, so we're not going to break all that out. Dave do you have any comments with regard to 21st Century Cures and impacts for ResMed?", "Dave Pendarvis", "Sure, so it's really well done by the industry to get this through, you know it's been a long time coming. You remember we were a while back and we were about to have some relief for the rollout of the national expansion of rates and it was stopped by a protest on the floor of the house for gun controls. Just goes to show you, crazy things can happen when you're trying to go through the legislative process.", "So the industry worked very hard, really across the board and was able to ensure that this time around it stuck and they got some relief, that was six months of relief and there are still some issues with competitive bidding rates and how competitive bidding is determined. But the industry I think on the whole feels good about having gotten a win and feels like, as Mick was saying earlier, that if Congressman Price is confirmed as Secretary of the HSS, there should be at least a sympathetic ear for perhaps some further regulatory relief. And as the industry moves forward you got some stability now. The rates are set with Medicare for the next two years, till January of '19 and Congressman Price has billed to add in binding bids, so that now anyone who bid in an area has to put up a bond, that's a benefit. And so I think the industry is feeling like it\u2019s a better environment with some more predictability and some more stability and that's a positive.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question, Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question.", "Saul Hadassin", "Maybe first question, Mick, any more color on just what the production issues involved with regards to those SKUs on the masks. In other words, is it a matter of adding more manufacturing lines, for example, or is it just simply putting more product through the existing lines and the demand has maybe caught you by a bit of surprise versus the production capabilities? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Saul, well yes clearly the market acceptance has been ahead of our expectations and Rob you want to go into some detail with regard to the manufacturing?", "Robert Douglas", "Any new product sold has new tooling and new things to learn about it and really new fine tuning to do on the process and it's really just a matter of mixing that fine tuning and matching that fine turning and process building, plus capacity building, which is predominantly driven by tooling and supply chain management. Matching that with the take up of demand and we should see that sort of match up as we said earlier through the quarter.", "Saul Hadassin", "Great. Thanks. Just a follow-up for Brett maybe. But just on the cash flow from operations, for the half, again, looks like it's reasonably weak versus the PCP. You did flag the inventory build. Should we expect that to recover second half as you start to clear this product that you've been building up, particularly on the mask side for the launch? ", "Brett Sandercock", "So, we've had -- I mean -- I think Q2 [ph] cash flow around 120 million was quite good and we just had some sort of modest working capital gain. So that was pretty good. If you look at comparing it to the prior year, I guess we're kind of -- working capital was definitely moving in our favor and we pushed that down quite a bit, so we're generating some big cash flow last year. But I'm still -- Q1 was a little low, it was quite happy with Q2, actually that cash flow ran 120 million, and you might -- we thought new product flow and so that we need to sort of catch up with -- and you might say that you're a little bit, but I still think overall working capital probably just a modest increase that we'll see.", "Operator", "Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on line with a question.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Just to start with on the core sleep business, by my calculations, and there's a lot of inputs here, looks like it increased, the gross margin increased by about 80 basis points. First of all, is that fair sequentially? And then is that strictly -- it looks like it's mostly manufacturing driven, maybe a little bit of mix on the generator side, but would love to hear your thoughts on that.", "Brett Sandercock", "So, I'm not sure on that. Sequentially -- if you look at this sequentially, we're at Q1 was 58.9 and this quarter was 58.3. I mentioned before unfavorable effects impacts around 40 basis points, a little high then what we expected with kind of deterioration in euro really through the quarter. I mean I guess the rest was pretty benign if you looked at it sequentially. If you look at it year-on-year which is up a tad from 58.1 up to 58.3 --.", "Mick Farrell", "Hey Brett, excluding Brightree.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, so excluding that we've got. Yes, I mean the bigger impact there is on product mix and we're still seeing really strong device growth. I think as we go forward and we get some improvements in mask growth with the new products and so on, then you'll see that impact moderate, but at the moment it's still a headwind for us, so that's kind of if you like kind of offsetting this to large extent on the Brightree. And had typical ASP decline and there was FX also year-over-year which was unfavorable, but as we mentioned earlier in manufacturing procurements so on, we've driven that and we've got efficiency there as well, which more than offsets those other elements.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Okay. I'll follow up a little bit offline on that. As far as Inova goes, I think when you bought that about this time last year, you said it would take about 18 months to refine the product, feel more comfortable in rolling that out to your broader sales force. Just based on the comments from earlier in the call, is it fair to say that you're a little bit ahead of schedule and you could be a little more aggressive in rolling that out throughout the course of 2017?", "Mick Farrell", "I\u2019ll take that. Matt, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much on schedule for that sort of 18 months, I'd get it to, where we think ResMed's quality and functionality should be. Look the Activox product is a great POC. It\u2019s light and very portable. But it can improve in some areas and we\u2019re really working on the improvement of those areas in terms of oxygen delivery and sustainability of that over the many months that they\u2019re out there helping patients get freedom back.", "And so I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t track and we\u2019re looking forward to gradually ramping that Inova product out there. And as we said in the prepared remarks earlier adding communication capability onto that and pulling it as part of the whole AirSolutions portfolio, we think we\u2019ll allow home care providers to do better fleet management of all these POCs that are out there, but really engage the patients in terms of inherence for the product as well. So the conclusion is, I think we're just pretty much right on track with the versus the timeline that you talk about.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Victor Windeyer from Citi Investment Research is online with a question.", "Victor Windeyer", "Look, my phone dropped out before so if I'm going to be repeating something, I apologize. I just wanted to understand the rest of the world masks and I think, from the questions, you've been saying that supply outstripped demand on this. Can you just confirm that? And why the masks in the rest of the world declined 4% post launch and what we're expecting there.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Victor. So I mean, I\u2019m sure, you heard the prepared remarks what we talked about. There are two factors behind EMEA and APAC on the masks. Number one, we had a big comparable, what was about around 8% constant currency growth in the quarter a year ago in EMEA and APAC. So we had some licensing revenue in there and some really good sales to particular customers.", "And we just launched the N20 and F20 at the ERS. And so it\u2019s the first quarter out there and as you know, you\u2019ve been following our stock for a long time, mask launches in EMEA and APAC, you're talking hundreds of countries and you go country-by-country and thy see the masks, they don\u2019t immediately buy the masks. It can even slowdown the purchases of current masks, because they see the next generation technology and they put it through their systems, they have it as their frontline setup and they work out how to put it into the protocols and starts to get launch through.", "So as we said earlier, we expect to gradual improvement of masks growth not only in the Americas, but also in EMEA and APAC. Certainly the positive in that region and then through Q3 and Q4, we really think the impact N20 and F20 are going to be there and sustainable throughout fiscal 2018.", "Victor Windeyer", "Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to ask about the sort of pricing and whether there has been a significant return -- end of quarter bulk discounts been away for a while. Has that come back into the market? How are you sort of seeing pricing around [indiscernible]?", "Mick Farrell", "We\u2019re seeing pricing as I said earlier in the pretty steady state these last six to eight quarters. Back to industry standards on year-on-year in terms of price. So the competition is fierce, but it\u2019s around innovation. Who's got the best fit, the best comfort, the quietest device and now best informatic solution to really improve quality of care with patients and provide us to improve their world flow efficiency. Thanks for your questions Victor.", "Operator", "We are now at the one-hour mark. So will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. ", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, thanks. In closing, I want to thank the 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing tens of millions of lives. We remain laser focused on our long term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020, and we look forward to executing on everything we talked about this last 60 minutes and driving this innovation, great products throughout 2017.", "Thanks for your time today. And we\u2019ll talk to you again in about 90 days. Thanks.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you everyone for joining us today. If there\u2019s any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I'll now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Kelly, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today, are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners now that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael Farrell", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q4 and our full fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we finished our fiscal year with robust performance in both our core sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business as well as a return to solid growth for our mask products.", "In my remarks I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, regional highlights from our global business, and an update regarding our long-term strategy. I'll also provide high level summaries of two recent acquisitions, first CareTouch, a healthcare informatics acquisition that we announced just a few weeks ago; and second, an investment that we made and announced just earlier today, a few minutes ago, it went over the wire with Curative Medical. Finally I'll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail, and then we'll get to Q&A.", "As you saw in our press release, our global team achieved double-digit revenue growth up 17% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. This is our best performance in over four years, and quite an achievement on the robust foundation of the $1.7 billion global business. Our team performed incredibly well.", "In our Americas region we achieved double-digit revenue growth, and in our combined European and Asia Pac region we achieved solid mid-single-digit growth on a constant currency basis. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep and respiratory care businesses.", "Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.68 on a non-GAAP basis. Our global team produced excellent top line growth this quarter, and we have been balancing our investments in growth opportunities while managing costs in R&D and SG&A. As you look ahead to our fiscal year 2016, we believe that we can achieve further operating leverage in both R&D and SG&A.", "Brett will talk about gross margin guidance in more detail in his remarks, but I would like to outline three areas for efficiency that are critical to our FY 2016 plans. First, we are moving more and more of our shipping volume from air freight to sea freight as we continue to ramp our product launches. Second, we are reducing supply chain costs with significant and sustained internal and external cost-out programs throughout FY 2016. And third, we continue to grow incremental manufacturing volume in our lower cost plants. In addition, we have also established sales plans for accelerated growth in our high margin products throughout FY 2016 and beyond, including the AirCurve 10 variable platform and the Astral Life Support Ventilation platform.", "Okay. Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas we had strong performance in Q4 sales, with the commercial team driving 27% year-on-year growth. Our team achieved phenomenal flow gen related growth of over 50% for the quarter. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing success of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 platforms, and it was powered by our Healthcare Informatics solutions, including AirView, U-Sleep, and myAir.", "We also saw ongoing customer adoption as we continue to expand our Life Support Ventilation business in the Americas with the Astral platform. We achieved good mask growth in the quarter with our AirFit portfolio, and it's important to note that pricing in this mask category is in a good place. We continue to expect solid Mask and Accessories category growth over the next year.", "Moving on to our combined European and Asia Pac region, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe, again driven by the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10 and the Astral platforms as well as robust growth in our Masks and our Accessories businesses.", "The big news for the Asia Pac group this quarter is our investment in the expansion of our China business. I'll talk more about the Curative Medical acquisition in a few moments.", "Let me now roll up to a broader perspective to discuss the progress we have made against our long-term growth plans, our three horizons of growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth, which encompasses our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive Healthcare Informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes.", "Our recent acquisition of CareTouch allows us to add key features to our resupply offerings. CareTouch is a provider of Internet-based solutions and resupply programs for the home care industry. This technology provides an easy use solution for managing patient populations with patient engagement algorithms and an automated IVR outreach as well as a live, multilingual call center. We have rebranded this offering as ResMed Resupply. We will continue to serve current CareTouch customers and expand this offering so that it's available to all our HME partners.", "As you heard at our Investor Day in San Francisco a few months ago from Raj Sodhi, the President of our Healthcare Informatics business, we now have established Healthcare Informatics as a core competence for ResMed. We will continue to build HI capabilities and buy them when appropriate so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings and ultimately improve patient outcomes.", "We also continue our ongoing efforts to build market awareness regarding the importance of sleep and sleep apnea during the quarter. We announced in the press release results from a study on our consumer wellness offering, the S+ by ResMed. The study showed that after one week of use 67% of S+ users with low baseline sleep scores achieved an improvement of an average 30 minutes of extra sleep per night.", "We are excited that our first consumer sleep wellness offer has achieved these results. The more consumers become aware of the importance of sleep and aware of any risky breathing or suffocation they have during the night, the better for addressing the vast majority of sleep apnea sufferers who are still not aware of their condition and have not yet seen a doctor about their problem.", "During the quarter we also announced a $5 million donation for medical research into sleep apnea and COPD to help create a Center for Excellence in this field at the University of California, San Diego. UCSD is a leading academic research institution located just a few miles from our global headquarters here in California. We believe that academic industry partnerships like this are critical to the ongoing innovation in the fields of both sleep and respiratory medicine.", "Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we are making solid progress on two fronts: list of free care market development, and ongoing investment in our high growth markets. We continue to grow our European Respiratory Care business from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade, since our acquisition of Saime in Europe in 2005. Our Americas region is fast following suit, fueled primarily by the Astral product offering. There is a very long global runway ahead for our life support, ventilation and our non-invasive ventilation solutions to help both COPD as well as neuromuscular disease patients.", "The Curative Medical acquisition that we announced earlier today hits on our strategy and horizon to both vectors. It grows our respiratory care product portfolio by adding current and existing and future ventilation products, and it also takes us to a leadership position in the geography in the high growth respiratory medical device market in China.", "Curative provides a complementary product portfolio for ResMed in both sleep apnea and respiratory care. ResMed and Curative offerings serve different customer segments through complementary channels. Together we have the broadest portfolio of innovative sleep apnea and ventilation devices, from premium imported devices to locally designed and manufactured product offerings that are tailored for the needs of the China market. We plan to continue to invest in both R&D and manufacturing in China for the Curative brand. We will maintain separate brands and distribution channels in order to quickly respond to the needs of the full spectrum of customer segments in China.", "Our Curative acquisition is an example of us putting our capital to work. We will continue to invest in China, India, Brazil, Eastern Europe and other key, high growth markets in medical devices. We will execute on long-term strategies that are tailored to each individual country while improving patient outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs.", "Our third horizon of growth includes a spectrum of cardio-respiratory conditions. We expect presentation of the SERVE-HF results by the study's primary investigators in a few months. Without going into too much detail on SERVE-HF, I would like to say that I am very proud of the global ResMed team and how we dealt with the SERVE-HF study. Our ethics and integrity was on full show. We made patient safety the most important priority. I believe that we have built credibility with patients, providers, cardiologists and our core sleep pulmonary and critical care physicians. That only adds to the ResMed brand.", "Subsequent quotes and discussions with key opinion leaders, both publicly and privately, have provided strength for this belief. We follow the data and we do the right thing. To this point you will see in the published results some interesting insights. For example, as discussed by our Chief Medical Officer at the APSS Conference in Seattle just a few months ago, as ejection fraction increases, there is an increasing trend towards benefit from ventilation therapy even amongst the third HF group. We will continue to monitor our heart failure patients in our U.S. based heart failure trial, which is called CAT-HF.", "Longer-term we see further adjacent opportunities in cardiology in heart failure but also in atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. I'll provide more regarding our ongoing cardiovascular strategy during our next quarterly call.", "We remain active on the capital management front. This quarter, our board has declared an increase of our dividend by 7% to $0.30 per share. And we are continuing with our share purchase program. You will hear more from Brett in just a few moments.", "On the M&A front, we continue to look at acquisition opportunities that meet these three criteria: first, the business is aligned with our long-term growth strategy; second, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and third, that there is a cultural fit between the leader of the business and ResMed in our innovation culture. We found two great companies that meet all three of these criteria recently; CareTouch and Curative Medical. We will continue to seek further opportunities as appropriate.", "Let me close with this. We remain excited about our performance, our near-term outlook and our long-term three horizons growth strategy. We are the global leaders in sleep and respiratory medicine not just in market share, but more importantly, in product, service, channel and market innovation. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly, for our patients.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q4 and full-year financials. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "All right. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $453.1 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 17%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weak euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $32.5 million in the fourth quarter.", "At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $273.7 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia Pacific totaled $179.4 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter.", "Breaking up revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $151.5 million, an increase of 53% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in Europe and Asia Pacific, flow generator sales were $121.1 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Revenue growth in Europe and Asia Pacific was lower mostly due to lower ASP sales and a tough prior year comparable for Asia Pacific, reflecting typical lumpy order cycles. Masks and other sales were $58.3 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 6%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 25% while masks and other increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter.", "During the quarter, we incurred a one-time charge of $5 million associated with a field safety notice expenses in the response to the result of the SERVE-HF clinical trial. Additionally, we made donations totaling $6 million, which comprised of $5 million dollar donation to the University of California, San Diego, and a one-off incremental donation of $1 million to the ResMed Foundation. All of these charges have been excluded in non-GAAP numbers.", "In addition, the non-GAAP measures exclude amortization of acquired intangibles in the current year and restructuring expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles in the prior-year quarter. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers is included in our fourth quarter earnings press release.", "My subsequent commentary will reference non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP gross margins for the June quarter was 68.4%, lower than guidance, essentially due to product and geographic mix, notably the strong performance in America's flow generator style and the impact of lower ASP sales as a result of the SERVE-HF trial outcome. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 450 basis points, reflecting adverse currency movements, unfavorable geographic mix, unfavorable product mix and declines in average selling prices. Looking forward in fiscal year 2016, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60% assuming current exchange rates.", "Now I'd like to spend a little time just walking through the drivers of our gross margin guidance. We are assuming that average selling prices remain relatively stable with a normal level of modest decline as we recycle the price change we made in the first half of fiscal year 2014. Our range does assume that we continue to have relative out-performance in America's flow-generated growth, which is positive to the top line but will have a negative price and geographic mix impact on our gross margin in fiscal year 2016. It also factors in the product mix impact associated with the expected reduction in ASV revenue.", "To the extent we continue to see out-performance in the America's flow generator growth, we would expect to move towards the lower end of our guidance range. However, as I said at our recent Investor Day, we're working very hard on our cost-out programs which include the benefit of shifting from air freight to sea freight as well as a pipeline of cost-out initiatives in the areas of procurement, production and logistics. The benefit to these programs will be realized over the course of fiscal year 2016 and will have a positive impact on our gross margin.", "Finally in terms of currency impacts on gross margin, the recent depreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar will continue to be a headwind in Q1, however there will be a positive benefit from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which will be reflected in our gross margin from the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $123.5 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increased by 12%, primarily due to higher available employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.2% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2016.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter; or in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.7%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, Informatics Solutions, and clinical trials, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $13.1 million. On a non-GAAP basis our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.8%, and for the full fiscal year 2015 our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.5%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 20% to 21%.", "Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $96.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $87.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.05 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro and partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar. On a constant currency basis, non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 11% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $99.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.2 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $17.7 million.", "We have continued to be active on the capital management front. Our board of directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, representing an increase of 7% over the previous quarterly dividend. Additionally during the quarter, we repurchased 941,000 shares for consideration of 55.9 million. And for fiscal year 2015, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for consideration of 152.6 million. At the end of June, we had approximately 15.5 million shares remaining under our authorized repurchase program. In addition as Mick outlined, we announced the acquisition of Curative Medical and expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar year 2015. We've not disclosed the financial terms of the transaction.", "In fiscal year 2015, we've returned 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders, live dividends and repurchases, and over the last five years, we've returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders, live dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $417 million, and at June 30, title assets put up $2.2 billion, and net equity was $1.6 billion. And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Kelly, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, we will not begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Your line is open.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Thanks very much for taking my call. Terrific results. Could I perhaps just ask the effect or just to characterize the effect of ASP from the safety recall just with a \u2013 we saw already trend lines I guess particularly around people with a normal heart function who might have complex sleep apnea.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Andrew, for the call. And I agree with you, it was a good quarter. With regard to SERVE-HF and the follow-up from that, the results these last months since we published the SERVE-HF results all had been presented by our Chief Medical Officer at the conferences and discussed them with regulators, the publication will be in a couple months, have been pretty much in line with the information that we put out there. And so we said that ASP accounts for around 7% of our revenues and about a quarter of that is potentially in this affected population. So we're talking about impact of less than 1.75% of our group sales. And that's sort of the trend line that we've seen approximately in that range over the last months since the data were published on the trial.", "Interestingly, our ASP business in narcotic-induced central sleep apnea or treatment emergent central sleep apnea has not been affected, and that's mostly in the U.S. side of the business and it's an opportunity for us to grow that what they sometimes call complex sleep apnea or treatment emergent central sleep apnea opportunity in Europe.", "Andrew Goodsall", "And with the \u2013 I know you described Europe as having some impact for ASP. Would there be any reason why Europe is perhaps a little bit more difficult post the safety notice in Europe than perhaps the U.S.?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, thanks for the follow-up, Andrew. And yes, since we had run the SERVE-HF trial predominantly in Europe, there were some sites in Asia Pac, but mostly in Europe, and had been a big focus on the heart failure component that the majority of the ASP effect has been within the European region.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Perfect. And [indiscernible] just really quick housekeeping, just the FX effect of the net income level from Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, on the FX impact on EPS this quarter, it was pretty significant. It was around $0.05 negative on EPS.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open. Again, your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor. Your line is open.", "Michael Farrell", "Matt, I think you've either got us on mute or you're not there. Let's go to the next question, Kelly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ben Andrew", "Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two areas for us; Mick, talk a little bit about the durability of the reacceleration in Masks? You had an easy comp obviously in the quarter, but you're getting rid of the price declines. Do you see Masks in the U.S., and you talked a little bit to this in your script, but do you see it getting back to the high-single-digit growth rate durably?", "Michael Farrell", "So good question, Andrew, and yeah it was a great turnaround from Q3 to Q4, from minus 3% to plus 5% on the Masks line. We do think that's a sustainable turnaround for a number of reasons. The AirFit portfolio, particularly the P10 and the F10, are very solid and strong masks and are being received really well by customers. That's point one. And point two is yeah, we annualized those price declines that we talked about from January to June, 2014 through January to June, 2015 so we're through that sort of hurdle. So good products, good pricing, good positioning and we think the masks will continue to do well for the year ahead.", "Ben Andrew", "Okay. And then on the gross margin side, Brett, maybe give us some insights into the relative magnitude of currency, mix, geography, things like that? So whether for Q4 or maybe for 2016 so we can be a little more granular in how we think about that? Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, Ben. If you look at Q4 year-on-year, and as you know a bunch of drivers on that margin, but if you look at that, the single biggest impact for us was FX. And to put that into perspective, I think it was around sort of that 150 basis point mark. So that was the biggest impact, but each of the others were meaningful in terms of geographic mix, product mix and ASP decline I think all played a part in that. That kind of gives you sort of a relative sense of what was driving the gross margin there.", "Ben Andrew", "And then the guidance again for 2016, is it presumably product mix is a bigger impact? Or is it some of the other things start to go the other way? Is that fair?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, I think that \u2013 yeah. I mean the mix, with the flow generator growth in the U.S., what you're seeing there is quite extraordinary. So it does swing your product mix and your geographic mix somewhat. So they sort of become a little more volatile, if you like. So I think if you were \u2013 I think it will run through fiscal year 2016, I think some of those will tend to moderate as kind of your cycle price introduction and so on. As you know we're working very hard on cost-out programs, and they will deliver. The timing will be uncertain but they'll deliver over the course of 2016.", "And then currencies, okay, that's always a bit of a wild card, but we've seen some depreciation in the Aussie dollar recently. We haven't seen the benefit of that yet, tends to lag about a quarter. Really we'll start to see some of that benefiting in Q2 as well. So I mean some of the \u2013 certainly a lot of those drivers that were working against us will certainly I think moderate over the course of 2016. But again, they're quite volatile so the kind of the gross margins guidance would be a little bit wider, I think that really accounts for some of the volatility we're seeing in some of the drivers.", "Ben Andrew", "Okay.", "Michael Farrell", "Ben, I'd just add to that, to Brett's comments which I agree with all of them, and I don't want to sound like a broken record but I'll reiterate what we're doing the next 12 months on this, we're moving from air freight to sea freight as these products ramp up. We're moving these cost-out programs in the supply chain, so that's with suppliers and our partners but also within our internal programs and manufacturing and COGS reduction. And thirdly, we're increasing the incremental growth at lower cost plants. And I think all those three elements will help move GM to the higher end of Brett's guidance rather than the low one.", "And then finally, our sales teams, Jim and Ann and their teams are being provided incentives to drive high gross margin growth. So growth in the AirCurve 10 range, growth in the Astral range, and growth in the AirFit range of masks all being provided incentives to the channel to make sure that we grow those high GMx products. And so all those together I think are a pretty powerful weapon.", "Ben Andrew", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great. Thanks. Maybe just to focus in on SERVE-HF and just cardiology, I'm wondering, Mick, maybe if you can resize the opportunity post the SERVE-HF results here, it seems there's still certainly an opportunity in the less sick patient population. I'm just wondering if there's any numbers that you can share with us around that? The follow-up to that would be is there an update on timing in getting to that patient population? And then lastly on this topic, which could be an update on CAT-HF? Thanks.", "Michael Farrell", "Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. So to seize the opportunity in HF globally, we're in the U.S. with more than 8 million patients and globally there are more than 20 million patients with heart failure worldwide. Obstructive sleep apnea progress in that group is north of 40%, we think central sleep apnea is around 30%. SERVE-HF was targeted at the 30%. If you look at all the key opinion leaders post SERVE-HF and their comments around both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea in general, is obstructive sleep apnea should be treated with all co-morbidities, and the SERVE-HF results have no impact on that area.", "I might go into some information in some publications that have come out from ATS in the American Journal for Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, on that front if we need to, but certainly that's what the key opinion leaders are saying. That's what we've seen in practice as we look at our sales over the last sort of 60, 90 days since the SERVE-HF results have come out. So as we look forward we think there's still a significant opportunity in heart failure with the obstructive sleep apnea patients.", "And amongst the central sleep apnea patients, which is the 30% prevalent side, physicians are still trying to work out what to do, whether it's just CPAP or a combination of oxygen and CPAP or bi-level, and they're working through each of those modalities. And I think you'll see a lot of research in the area to go closer to HF to next steps. We are working with Chris O'Connor and the group at CAT-HF to certainly finish and follow through on the patients who are already in that trial. And Rob and I just had a teleconference with Chis O'Connor a couple of days ago, and we're planning for next steps post HF and post CAT-HF, how do we find the groups of patients who are well treated and we can really focus on health economics, keeping patients out of hospital beyond that 30-day, 90-day period with heart failure, which is such a focus, and their functional outcomes as steps that we look ahead for post CAT-HF and post SERVE-HF.", "And as I said in the preliminary remarks, we're in the field of play here. We'll give you an update next quarter as to where we are with our cardiovascular strategy, but we're not moving away from this area. In fact, we're likely to double down on it because as you'll see, the results from SERVE-HF come out with some pretty interesting insights as you look at the different quintiles and the different groups of patients. But I'm not going to say too much more on that because I'm going to wait for the data to be published in the period review article, and then I can start to talk about the market opportunities that have part of that. Thanks for the question, Anthony.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Steve Wheen", "Good morning. Just a quick question on the margin again; you mentioned the various factors, Brett, that were impacting it. One of them is the ASP, the ongoing ASP declines. You're obviously seeing a rebasing of pricing in masks now that it's returned to growth, so is there, can you just sort of talk to the think pressure you're seeing across the flow generators, which I assume is where that is coming from?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, I mean, the ASP declines was year-on-year, Steve, so still cycling a little bit of that kind of second half impact, but we're basically through that now. So we do think the impacts from ASP declines will certainly moderate from where they've been. And that's kind of being factored into the guidance. As Mick said, we're seeing a relatively stable environment, I guess, on the pricing at the moment, and that's kind of across the whole product range really.", "Steve Wheen", "Okay. And then, some commentary that you made last quarter was that you'd be expecting to be not as reliant on air freighting. Did that not pan out as you expected just because of the sheer uptick in volume that you saw in flow generators? Are we still seeing that sort of impact on the gross margin from air freight?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, true. We haven't been able to get, basically move from air freight to sea freight quite as quickly as we would have liked. And you saw it just in the latest quarter. When you look at it, frankly the flow gen growth has been accelerating through the quarters. This quarter you saw 50% growth in the U.S., which is quite phenomenal. But the guys have really done a great job in making sure we've got the capacity there and that product is going out to market quite seamlessly. But we've been doing that with obviously more air freight than we would like. Based on the trend down it was kind of where we're looking at July that I'm quite happy with how we're trending that now. But I do think that will start to see meaningful benefit I think coming through in Q2 on the freight out program. The trajectory and the trend is absolutely there, so I'm quite confident we'll see that; likely to be Q2 impact at this stage.", "Steve Wheen", "Yeah. And just to be clear, that air freight cost is sitting in your gross margin, not in your SG&A line? And if you can just cover off on whether or not because of that demand in flow generators you've got any unfilled orders?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, so definitely it's in our gross margin, the freight. The \u2013 and we don't, no, we would have finished the quarter pretty much with negligible back orders.", "Steve Wheen", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior from Evans & Partners. Your line is open.", "Matthew Prior", "All right, guys. Great results. Just two questions; first one from me is Mick, just in terms of the U.S. sales and the great flow gen result, where are we in terms of the Astral product cycle and ramp-up given that \u2013 I'm just wondering with the strong U.S. flow gen result and the uptake of Informatics if we're focused a little bit too much on the sleep side of the business? And you may be having success in ventilation in Astral in the U.S. that's somewhat covered up I guess in the focus on that number.", "Michael Farrell", "Well, Matthew, the U.S. flow generators numbers includes both sleep and respiratory care products, but the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 are the vast majority of it. But I'll hand it over to Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to maybe give a little more color on the growth of our Astral line of respiratory care and the flow generator, the amazing growth in the line's growth for the quarter.", "James Hollingshead", "Yeah, we've had great flow generator growth across the entire quarter. Specifically your question on Astral, it's still early days on Astral. And so that's still ramping, but it's so far, exceeding our expectations. The device is quite a good device. It's very strong clinically and it has very high ease of use. And so we're very happy, we're very pleased with the adoption of Astral. It's ahead of expectations.", "Matthew Prior", "All right. Thanks. And just a second question from me. Mick, in terms of Informatics, can you talk whether the Informatics roll-out and uptake has driven any mask resupply styles increase in terms of that important metric, and whether that aided you in the fourth quarter with U.S. mask sales? And also just ask are you seeing any re-tapping on the back of Informatics' success? Thanks.", "Michael Farrell", "Good questions, Matt. The Healthcare Informatics core competency, the capability their view, U-Sleep and myAir has really enabled us to achieve those flow generator growth numbers. The analogy would be iTunes is such a great platform that people are buying a lot of iPhones and iPads, and so we do think that the growth of those flow generators is linked to really the changing of the basis of competition in our industry from just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And that more connected element is the Informatics that liberates the data, unlocks values for patients, providers and physicians and, ultimately, hospital systems.", "Your question, your sort of part two of the question was is there a link to the Q4 masks number? And I'd say, no, no, just yes, right? The acquisition of Jaysec earlier this fiscal year and CareTouch that we announced just earlier this month, both will enable us to use those data to drive resupply programs and to get them out to all the HMEs and make available to all the HMEs. We think there's still a huge opportunity to contact patients and let them know how far up they are along in their mask gauging and give them an opportunity to buy. So I think as you look forward over FY 2016 and beyond, there's a huge opportunity for Informatics to drive mask sales, but it wasn't really there in Q4.", "And the re-tapping opportunity again, I'd say that's not in the historic, that's in the future. And we do have an opportunity to reach out to patients through the Informatics solution, to e-mail, text or IVR to patients on coaching and adherence, and that could lead to reaching out our masks and on re-tapping. So you'll hear more from us over the coming fiscal year, and we can give you an update next quarter as to the link between Informatics and driving those trialing revenues. But it's a huge opportunity for us and for our channel and for the patients.", "Matthew Prior", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Michael Farrell", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Du from CBA. Your line is open.", "Bruce Du", "Hi, guys. I just firstly was following up on the ASV question prior. You touched on sort of the impact in Europe, so I was sort of just wondering whether or not you've seen or probably expect to see the next couple of quarters any impact in terms of demand out of Asia. And I know you sort of mentioned that Japan in the past has been quite a lumpy market, but this thing could take up there?", "Michael Farrell", "Yeah, Bruce. Well, I'll hand it to Rob Douglas to talk about the impacts on ASV in Asia Pac. Rob, do you want to take that?", "Robert Douglas", "Yeah, definitely. We've talked quite a lot that the ASV's been very successful, and there have been a lot of local trials in Japan. In various patient populations, there's an incredible amount of support for the ASV in Japan. Given the different regulator environments in that, the Japanese regulators are moving at a very deliberate pace towards analyzing and understanding what this has been and what it all means, but we expect there still to be significant interest in Japan. And in the short-term Japan remains, still because of the nature of the market, we have variable demand on a quarter-to-quarter basis for Japan. So it's a little bit hard to measure that exactly at this stage.", "Michael Farrell", "The only thing I'd add to Rob's comments, which I agree with them, is that in Japan ASV is often used in an acute setting.", "Robert Douglas", "Yeah.", "Michael Farrell", "The SERVE-HF results were done in a chronic setting, and so the physicians there are working through the difference of application between acute and chronic care, and there are different clinical implications. And more will come out post the publication of the SERVE-HF data on that in the coming months. Thanks for the question, Bruce.", "Bruce Du", "Okay. Great. And I just had one more, it was just around clarifying is it correct that the non-invasive ventilation is now out of competitive bidding, the upcoming round?", "Michael Farrell", "I'll hand to Dave Pendarvis to answer that.", "David Pendarvis", "Yup. Short answer is yes, Bruce, that the next rounds of competitive bidding will not include non-invasive ventilation. There was an initial proposal that it would, and the announcement after that, that it's not included in competitive bidding, which our customers feel good about and we feel good about.", "Bruce Du", "Okay. Excellent. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to start with the \u2013 a follow-up to a previous question on the Informatics. Mick, just as you think about where that product line can go going forward, I think we're probably low-single-digits in terms of market share at this point, but just how that market's going to segment itself over the next several years between the real high end featured products including Informatics versus kind of your average mid-to-low feature set and then the low end as well?", "Michael Farrell", "Yeah, Matthew. The impact on revenue of the Informatics is really through the rest of the business. So if you think of Informatics really as an enabler or a new basis of enabling our HME providers, our patients and our physicians to get access to data. So physicians can access data in AirView, patients can access it in myAir, and then through electronic data interchange we're able to put the data into Epic or Cerner systems for hospitals and even payer providers so they can leverage that data.", "So the monetary, you're talking about what percentage of the revenue, the monetary feedback directly from payments for the Informatics Solutions is de minimis and it's not material. But the enabling of the sales, such as the 53% growth in flow generators in the quarter in the Americas, was really fueled and catalyzed and powered by those Healthcare Informatics solutions. So we do have internal calculations of the value of Informatics to justify our ongoing investment in that space, but it's a really long-term play about showing the value of home care, of taking sick patients out of hospital, putting them in a home and saving money for broken healthcare systems that's there.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Sorry, Mick, I think I wasn't real clear on the question. It wasn't a function of what kind of revenue can you get from the Informatics. It was more of a function of if you don't offer Informatics on your CPAP system, are you just not going to be able to participate in the segment of the market, and will that segment of the market be 25%, 30% of all CPAPs being sold in a few years.", "Michael Farrell", "That's a good question. Thanks for the clarification, Matthew. Look, I think that it'll first be 100% of the market that you require data because what's happening is what we're doing is if you look at the data that's in our investor deck there, the published data that we put out there on the product called U-Sleep, where we showed a 59% reduction in the labor costs for the HME upon using U-Sleep and an increase in adherence from 73% to 83%. You start to run the economics for our customer, and it's going to become just an essential basis of competition to play.", "But I want to make it clear that Informatics is not Informatics. It's not just saying, well I can get my data to the cloud. It's doing it fast, securely, enabling systems to move quickly, and I do think there's a partnership element of connecting directly into the Epic or Cerner system or into our HME-provider systems on the electronic front. And it's a global play. It goes beyond just the first four ways, really just been in the U.S. in the Americas region, but we are now moving our Informatics capabilities into France, Germany, Japan, and it's really something that is going to go global. So I think it quickly goes from where it is now to 100% over the coming quarters and fiscal year.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Okay. And then as the follow-up, the Curative transaction that you just announced. I know that you didn't want to provide too much in the way of details, but could you just give us a sense for how quickly that business is growing and the profitability profile versus overall resonating?", "Michael Farrell", "So we're not going to get into specific details on it because it's not material to our global business. It's on the order of 1% of our group revenues. It's growing faster than our group, and we're very excited about the opportunity. It takes us to a leadership position within the China market and sleep and respiratory medicine. And Jason Sun, the founder and CEO, is a great gentlemen, an individual, a very smart leader and entrepreneur who's created a very strong team around him in Suzhou. And we're really excited to be partnering with Curative to help grow and help the Chinese population get access to great care across the customer segments from Curative and ResMed.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Matthew Taylor", "Hi. Apologies for before, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask one about masks. In the beginning of your prepared comments, you said that you were excited about mask growth next year, you expected robust growth. And I was wondering if you could just help us qualitatively understand what's driving that? If it's pull-through or launches or both, or just continued strength of the product?", "Michael Farrell", "Yeah, Matt, I'm excited about the mask growth. People close to the business are even more excited about it. I'm going to hand it over to Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to talk about it.", "James Hollingshead", "Yeah. Thanks, Matt. We've talked over the last two or three quarters about how we changed our pricing strategy and now that that's been grandfathered I think the biggest move that happened this quarter is a lot of those pricing moves that we made in mask in the second half of the prior year of neg ramp [ph] following through. So we've seen pricing stabilize. The AirFit range of masks continues to compete very, very strongly, I would say especially in pillows and full face. The nasal market has always been the most competitive category of masks and continues to be quite competitive. But our volumes are up and our pricing is stabilizing. We have a very strong position and we feel confident we can maintain growth.", "Matthew Taylor", "Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on flow gens, just given how strong the Americas growth has been, once you start comping those big numbers, how much more can you grow over those 53%, 42% growth numbers that you had in the back half?", "Michael Farrell", "Yeah, Matt, if you look at our global sleep and respiratory market, we believe it's growing in the sort of mid-single digits. So you can't grow double-digits forever, but our goal is to not just meet but we want to beat market growth in every geography we're in every financial period we're there. So we're searching for excellence. The team has produced excellence, and we're going to continue to do what we can to outperform market growth.", "Matthew Taylor", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Ian Abbott", "Oh, yes. Good afternoon. I was just wondering on the informatics where you're at in the roll-out of that to DMEs in the U.S.? Do you think you've pretty much reached all of them with your latest informatics, or do you still get some way to go there?", "Michael Farrell", "Jim?", "James Hollingshead", "It's a great question, Ian. Thanks. The \u2013 where we've seen everybody with the initial offering, right? So the uptake of the initial offering has been very, very strong. And I think that that's a huge contributor to the flow gen growth. We're taking share in flow gen and I think we're taking share in flow gen. And a large part of the devices is great the device, both the AirSense and AirCurve devices are fantastic devices, just an aside [ph] , but the Informatics side of that with anybody comms and the Software-as-a-Service platform is clearly starting to get uptake because it creates a lot of value for our customers. And what they're seeing is both they can increase compliance and therefore increase revenue, but they also take out a lot of labor-intensive processes with it and troubleshooting and patient management some. So broadly it's getting adopted.", "We will add to the platform. So you see things like the Jaysec acquisition and the CareTouch acquisition. As we build on the platform our customers will get even more growth. And so as we build the platform we hope to drive even more adoption, which should maintain an even grow share in the flow gen space, make our customers' businesses more productive, more profitable, and improve the health of the market for both us and for our customers.", "Ian Abbott", "So would mastery [ph] be on some version of it already? I mean I know you're saying you're rolling out more, but do you feel like you're fairly well there already?", "James Hollingshead", "I think there's a lot of growth to come. I mean I think that the platform will grow and so we'll have more feature sets and more opportunities for growth as the platform grows, but we've had very broad adoption of the product set across the whole market of HMEs, right. It's not restricted to a customer set. We're getting broad adoption across all of our customers. We're getting growing adoption across our customers. And we will continue to drive that as we add more features to the platform.", "Michael Farrell", "And Ian, I'd add that beyond the U.S. geography which sort of has been the first early adopter here if you like of the Healthcare Informatics solutions, and that study I referenced was based in the U.S., we're seeing the same thing as we take this offering to France, to Germany, to Japan, across Northern Europe and we will be taking this globally to all of the 100 countries that we provide products in. And the value that's provided in this is universal. I mean we take waste and inefficiency out of the delivery system.", "We provide data real-time, we call it the HALO, Hour After Last Off. You literally can put your mask down at 6:30 a.m., by 7:30 a.m. your data are in the cloud and they're available for you on your smartphone on myAir. There available for the doctor at your 7:30 appointment. And they've available to the portfolio manager who's looking at a population of chronic disease, of COPD, sleep apnea or heart failure or hypertension patients. And so the value of that has such a low runway that Jim saying it's available to every customer in the U.S. is 100% true, but has it fully unlocked all its value in the U.S.? No way. And has it gone to every country around the world that we do business in? And have we been able to show that value fully yet? No way. There's a whole lot of runway left on that.", "Ian Abbott", "Okay. Thank you. And my other question was about SERVE-HF; it's now a couple of months since you actually came out with the trial, initial trial data. How would you characterize the response from the sleep doctors from that, and the cardiologists? How would you sort of in general characterize the response, and what sort of things are they looking for going forward?", "Michael Farrell", "So on this one, I won't characterize a response. I'll read out the response from the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, which is the journal of the American Thoracic Society. Let's read two paragraphs out. This is four authors from University of British Colombia, Johns Hopkins, Brown and others.", "The title of the paragraph is What Should we do with Patients Being Treated with ASV for Other Indications? And I'll just quote this. \"It is important to note that survey chest study only included patients with heart fail, with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly central events, and the findings should not be extrapolated beyond the study population. Patients who have been given ASV for other indications, such as narcotic injuries, central sleep apnea, heart failure, preserved ejection fraction or complex sleep apnea, can likely continue ASV safely as we see no compelling reason to withdraw, especially if there is a beneficial impact on their symptoms.\" And they go on further to say, \"We believe that newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea should be treated on CPAP as a first-line treatment of obstructive sleep apnea if clinically indicated as there is no compelling reason to believe that CPAP is harmful in any way with heart fail, with reduced ejection fraction patients.\"", "So they're just two quotes directly from publication in mid-July from APS. What we've seen out in the market is exactly that. The sleep physicians and the cardiologists are working together to look for patient groups where they can double-down on treatment with, I would say, bi-level, oxygen and ASV, and they're looking for areas where there might a safety signal, but as we delve further and further into the SERVE-HF data, our chief medical officer said at a session at APSS that when you get ejection fraction above 30%, the safety signal goes away.", "So these data are going to get out there. There's going to be public, and there's going to be a lot of follow on, but the dust has sort of settled on these last two months, and it's sort of what we predicted, as I said earlier, in the numbers, and as adjusted earlier, they're from the peer-reviewed press that we're starting to see articles concerning that and certainly in the numbers we're seeing in sales and the channel. We're seeing that we're all moving forward, and a great thing about this is that we've done some great scientific research. We have the data on Kern-Loin [ph] showing a 60% reduction in mortality in severe COPD, and we had a safety signal in heart failure. But our reputation at ResMed in our clinical community only goes up by these large, randomized controlled trials that we publish in the peer-reviewed press and will continue to do that.", "Ian Abbott", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Low from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "David Low", "Thanks very much. I think most of the questions have been asked, but just a couple of ones. Competitive bidding, which is a national roll-out next calendar year, what are your expectations or the implications of that?", "Michael Farrell", "Dave?", "David Pendarvis", "So it's still a little bit up in the air, but the announcement is that you've got a January 1 phase-in that goes sort of half and half with existing rights and half with the national averages, or national averages plus 110% depending upon whether you're in an MSA or not. And then July 1 going forward would be the new rights set on either the national or local averages.", "But we obviously support our customers. We think our customers ought to be getting fair value for the services that they are providing. And I know there is still dialogue that is going on. So it remains to be seen whether or not this goes forward on the date as scheduled but regardless we think that this competitive bidding that's been in round one and in round two is a known quantity.", "So from a disruption standpoint there should be less, there's a little bit easier to plan for. And also because there's no reduction in the number of providers while on the one hand you'd say for our customers it's not quite as fair because they're just taking the price cuts without getting the volume up. On the other hand, there's less disruption in terms of who's going to be in the market as a customer. So we'll wait and see when it comes out and how it progresses. But we feel reasonably confident about how the market is going to develop between here and there.", "David Low", "Okay, thanks. And just switching to the acquisition that's been announced today, Curative. Am I right in understanding that effectively you'll have two product ranges in China? And is that a strategy that you'd expect to take to other markets?", "Michael Farrell", "Sir Rob Douglas will answer this.", "Robert Douglas", "Yeah, thanks, David. So we think the Curative brand is actually quite strong in China. It's one of the major players there. And the interesting thing behind the acquisition rational, there's a very strong correlation in culture and values in those brands values. And also as we think about China in terms of segmentation in the market where there are people who want to buy our stuff, expensive stuff and people who want good stuff, local. And so we \u2013 and our distribution channels are actually quite complementary through that. So specifically in China we see that multi-brand strategy working well and we talk with our teams, we will have coordinated strategies, but we'll be very independent entities. And we think that's a very efficient way to run an integration plan. As we look at other markets they'll be done on a market-by-market basis as to what makes sense in those as we move across the world.", "David Low", "So is security offer cheaper presumably then a ResMed or a Respironics offer?", "Michael Farrell", "You know what? I don't think we'd go there. It's more a question of functioning, good functioning, good value products, our target into the right segments. And really these products have all been designed in China for the China market. So they really got the right picture fit for those patients that have targeted that.", "David Low", "Okay. Great. Well, thanks very much.", "Michael Farrell", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Securities. Your line is open.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I have a very specific one and a very big picture one. First one specific, what's really interesting to me is that year-over-year your gross margins declined by 450 basis points, but operating margins are only down 90 basis points which means you're managing the rest of your expenses. How do I think about the FX impact that rolls through the other expenses that helped you capture that only 90 basis point hit?", "Michael Farrell", "Brett, do you want to have the first go at that and maybe Rob add some color?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. I mean Joanne, you're right, I mean we do take more of a holistic approach to it and sort of the products and for example the flow gen growth's been great on top line, been some pressure on the gross margin but we also managed the operating expenses as well. So at an operating profit level, and you can look at it on a non-GAAP basis, operating profits grew 5% notwithstanding a bunch of FX headwinds and distractions from SERVE-HF and so on. So this thing kind of demonstrates pretty resilient, pretty robust business I think. And so we try to manage it across the board, not just kind of one particular segment.", "So but the currency, so I mean certainly it helps us if you like the currencies through the SG&A and R&D, helps us a bit on the gross margin. I think if you step back, take a longer term, I think we're still very committed to getting operating leverage at kind of that SG&A or operating profit level, so I think, think of it in that context, that we do want to get operating leverage there. To the extent we get that, that's certainly going to drop to the bottom line and help our earnings per share.", "Joanne Wuensch", "That's helpful. So it implies that, that is the right way to think about this holistically, that there's a lot of pieces running through this and that there's room over time...", "Brett Sandercock", "Exactly.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay.", "Brett Sandercock", "Exactly.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you. Now for the big picture question, most of my medtech companies at this stage are consolidating. We're running a lot of merger models on a regular basis. You guys have done an amazing job since the spin-out from Baxter, you're making tuck-in acquisitions like we saw today in China. How do you think about playing the new world order where more product is better product?", "Michael Farrell", "Well, Joanne, you know we play in a different space to companies like the big ones you're talking about like Medtronic, Covidien, Label [ph] . You're selling products to hospitals and large GPOs [ph] . Our job, and at some of the lines with the Western European healthcare systems and where the U.S. healthcare system has now gone with Accountable Care organizations, that the goal now is to keep patients out of hospital and in the home. And within the homecare medical device space we have a very strong position, and certainly within the respiratory medical and COPD side we're the market leader in driving those channels.", "So I would say our opportunity is to continue to drive value to show that taking patients out of hospital and putting them into the home is the right thing. And our job is to run faster and do better and to make sure that we continue to grow. We will continue to look at M&A, as we announced on this call two acquisitions, and our goal is organic growth and leveraging our current business, driving the operating leverage that you mentioned in the first part of your question, but also looking strategically at how we can add value to the marketplace, and I think taking patients out of the hospital, managing them in the home, getting the data to the cloud so you can quantify the benefit of that is kind of a unique value proposition, if you like, to the medical device market.", "Yeah, we have competition, and we continue to compete against our fellow competitors in the homecare space and the respiratory space. I think we do it better and I think we'll continue to lead and innovate and look at appropriate M&A to keep ourselves at the front of the pack.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you.", "Michael Farrell", "Thanks, Joanne.", "Operator", "And we are now at the one hour mark. I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for closing remarks.", "Michael Farrell", "Thanks, Kelly. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives with every breath. We've had an incredible year launching game-changing products and services and we've reached $1.7 billion in annual revenues, but we remain laser focused on our long-term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you again for joining us. If there's any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I will be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions]", "The company has asked me to address certain matters: First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements.", "These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead, sir.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Thank you, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining.", "I'll begin as usual with some summary remarks, and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock for some more granularity on the finances.  And we will then do some Q&A.", "First, the financial summary. We finished with another extremely solid quarter and fiscal year. Global revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 grew 9% to $372 million, up 13% on a constant currency basis.", "Revenues in the Americas grew 13% year-over-year to $207 million. And ROW revenues increased by 3% or 13% in constant currency terms to $165 million.  This represents our 70th consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line since we went public.", "I don't believe there are too many companies in that category that can boast a record like that. But we'll get some more granularity on that for those who are interested.", "For fiscal 2012, we reported revenues of approximately $1.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year and earnings per share of $1.71, up 19% year-over-year.  We believe that superior product quality continues to drive our growth.", "Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $77 million, while GAAP EPS increased a robust 43% to a record $0.53 for this quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.54.", "With respect to product performance, let me start with masks. All mask categories showed strong growth. And we continue to take market share, particularly with the Mirage nasal mask, which is thus far proving to be a seeming game changer.", "Accessories also grew strongly, as both large and small HMEs and DMEs are becoming more systematic about resupply and delivery of replenishment supplies to the patients who need them.", "Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by the high-end devices. Strong sales reflect the benefits of having all of our PAP devices configured on the smaller, quieter and more appealing S9 platform.", "In the Americas the S9 AutoSet and the VPAP Adapt, which is an adaptive servo-ventilator did particularly well.", "Growth in the Flow Generator segment was also driven by a positive mix shift from basic CPAP to APAP due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing, as well as, we believe, physician preference to put patients on the AutoSet, which provides more flexible therapy, improves patient comfort and appears to enhance compliance.", "The new EasyCare Online Compliance Management system continues to be well received, and we expect to see some solid ongoing uptake from existing, as well as new accounts.", "Products and programs which provide superior therapy and better compliance are what bring the most value to the patients, customers and service providers. In other words, across the whole food chain.", "Europe continues to be challenging due to difficult macroeconomic environment, although sales were relatively strong in both Germany and the U.K. Despite this challenging economic climate, bilevel, AutoSets CS, which is also our version of the adaptive servo-ventilator in the rest of the world, and the Stellar products all did well in this quarter.", "We also believe that great opportunities exist in Europe to address the connection between sleep-disordered breathing and various  comorbidities, such as heart disease, diabetes and so on, as well as occupational health and the more compelling economic case and the more -- and the more and more compelling economic case for treating sleep apnea in general.", "There's also a great deal more focus on compliance, which certainly positions us well with our high-quality products.", "The Asia Pacific region also had a solid quarter, particularly in the Japanese market, due to strong sales in sleep, as well as our bilevel and respiratory product portfolio, which also did very well.", "Of interest, cardiologists are adopting adaptive servo-ventilation, with some bigger in Japan. In fact, some cardiologists are actually using ASV even in patients without frank sleep-disordered breathing. And as they have noted, an improvement in various chronic heart failure parameters, particularly ejection fraction. Emerging markets like India, China and the Middle East also did very well this quarter.", "Ventilation sales of Stellar 100 and 150 continue to grow, especially in Europe, Latin America and Asia and again, more particularly in Japan.", "Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPS, which is a new automatic bilevel mode. iVAPS is also included in the new S9-based VPAP ST and the ST-A products. These are launching this quarter.", "VPAP ST-A with iVAPS has FDA clearance for respiratory insufficiency. The launch of this product on the S9 platform is significant, as we have actually skipped a generation in this segment in going from the S9 platform, which is a lot more bulky to the much smaller S9 platform.", "On the home sleep testing front, commercial payers continue to introduce the requirement of pre-authorization for intended PSG sleep test. United joined the club in July. And as a result, by the end of summer, 2/3 -- more than 2/3 of covered lives will need pre-authorization to polysomnography.", "We estimate that in -- we estimated that in 2011, about 50% of all sleep tests were HST, and we expect to see at least 25% of all sleep tests being HST-derived by the end of this calendar year. And we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, which is up to close to 30%.", "We're also participating in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance, with PCPs becoming more involved and interested in sleep apnea diagnosis.", "A few weeks ago, we acquired an innovative data services technology provider, known as Umbian, headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Umbian offers a comprehensive patient compliance management solution called U-Sleep, which monitors CPAP devices and provides a suite of interactive follow-up services for health care providers.", "For HME providers, usually there's an effective tool to reduce cost and improve business efficiency. U-Sleep supports CPAP devices from the leading CPAP manufacturers so that usage data can be consolidated and viewed from one software platform. This technology is able to assess a patient's compliance using a flexible set of rules that have been set up for that specific individual and provide immediate notification of compliance outcomes via e-mail, phone or if the provider prefers, text messages.", "U-Sleep's simple yet powerful design also provides multiple reporting options tied to the varying needs of HME providers.", "One of the biggest issues facing HMEs is competitive bidding and concomitant pricing pressures. By providing a scalable solution for compliance outreach, we are taking a significant step in supporting our HME partners to drive efficiencies and cost reduction in their businesses.", "Customers use products from a range of manufacturers. And this is one of the strengths of the U-Sleep platform. U-Sleep will continue to transfer compliance data from therapy devices manufactured by other companies.", "On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep-disordered breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize.", "Just to summarize a few of the newest findings. Sleep disorders are associated with the following: One, a higher risk of dying from cancer with the risk correlated with the severity of the disease; diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a debilitating disease, which causes severe pain in the hands and feet; three, frequent co-morbidity with polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal disorder which affects up to 10% of women of childbearing age; four, poor prognosis in chronic heart failure. But with the treatment of the sleep-disordered breathing with nocturnal ventilation the outcomes are significantly improved. Let's see, six, untreated central sleep apnea and heart failure readmission to hospital. This is particularly significant since it turned out that central sleep apnea was by far and away the most significant parameter, which was involved with the readmission of patients with chronic heart failure to the hospital. This suggests a wonderful opportunity for our adaptive servo-ventilator products. And finally, there's double the risk -- if the patient has sleep-disordered breathing, there is double the risk of retinal vein occlusion.", "In summary, this suggests that sleep-disordered breathing is involved with a multitude of diseases, and treatment of the disorder really ought to be part of any standard of care, just like one would take blood pressure.", "Finally, a study has just been published in Population Health Management on the cost savings associated with an education campaign on the diagnosis and management of sleep-disordered breathing. The primary objective was to determine if medical expenses of members enrolled in the not-for-profit U.S.-based Union Pacific Railroad Employes Health Systems health plan were reduced after implementing a low-cost, patient-focused education program on sleep-disordered breathing.", "Based on the retrospective analysis of medical claims data, the campaign was associated with a 145% increase in the uptake of PAP therapy by members with sleep-disordered breathing. And within 2 years after initiating the program, the use of PAP therapy was associated with almost $5 million in differential savings and overall medical costs, lower inpatient hospital costs and fewer hospital admissions than those members with sleep-disordered breathing who did not receive therapy.", "These findings suggest that the sleep-disordered breathing education campaign can improve health care outcomes and result in substantial savings through for the health care plan.", "All of the peer-reviewed literature continues to make it abundantly clear that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is at best seriously debilitating and costly to the health care system and at worst life threatening. These findings add to the continuing mounting evidence connecting serious health disorders to untreated sleep-disordered breathing and point to the necessity of making the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, as I've just said, a standard of care in all medical practice.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide more granularity on the financials, and then we'll take your questions.

I miss some of the details there. Could you just fly through that?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Those are Dan -- well the VPAP ST and the VPAP ST-A are bilevel units are now in the S9 platform. So initially, we did the CPAPs. But now we're putting all products, including the adaptive servo-ventilator into the S9 platform. So it's much more appealing, it's smaller, it's quieter and we're pretty excited now that we've got everything. And we're just launching the ST and the ST-A this quarter.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Understood. Look, just one of the other big issue that's obviously been going around, there's been a lot of discussion about competitive bidding, the impact on the company. Some of the discussion around the industry is that ResMed, in fact -- ResMed are looking to partner with some of the HMEs. There might actually be some volume offsets here. Could you sort of give us a bit of a run-through on what you think the competitive bidding impact is?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, let me just make a few comments, and I'll turn it to Mick for some further comment. The competitive bidding, if you look at our business, the impact is total revenues, the exposure is about 10% of the revenues. So I'll call it $140 million. But the interesting thing, as I've said in a previous earnings call, we have no significant impact on ASPs. And bear in mind, this is all and I guess stating the obvious, it's all CMS. And so the private payers have already dealt with this on ASPs. And if you like, they're ahead of CMS. But we don't see it as a significant factor at all. And I think you, in fact, Dan, have actually written about this. So private payers are not impacted. It's only CMS. And we're continuing to support our customers through a variety of resources to enable them to incorporate the latest Medicare requirements. But it's -- we don't -- it's just not -- it seems to spook people out in the marketplace, for some reason, the analysts in particular. But it doesn't spook us. And I don't know whether -- Mick, do you want to add anything to that?", "Michael J. Farrell", "No, I just confirm 3 points on competitive bidding. Number one, as you noted, it's 20% to 25% of our U.S. business, but that's 10% to 12% of our global business. Number two, in the first 9 cities, we're in a real-time experiment here. We're in month 14 of that, and we haven't seen a material impact on us. In fact, we've maintained or grown share with the customers who were the winners. And that the winners, third point, have scale. They are large companies that we either have electronic data interchange or some ways of finding efficiencies in the system. So that would take cost out of the system of delivering to patients. So they're the 3 points I'll make on that, Dan?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Jacob Messina", "It's Jacob Messina in for Joanne. Just quickly wanted to ask a little bit about -- more about Umbian, if you could. The U-Sleep, How it fits with EasyCare, how it fits with the franchise, how it will be marketed, that kind of thing.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I'm going to flip that question to Don Darkin, who is President of the Strategic Business Unit for Sleep. Because Don is the guy who negotiated the purchase and the earner. So, Don, over to you to make a comment?", "Donald Darkin", "Thanks. So what we're doing here is pulling in a compliance software package, which actually is sort of adjunct to the EasyCare online solution that we've just launched. So what we're seeing here is that with that program and the program we just launched, it will become a much easier solution for HMEs and providers where we intend to take costs out and allow these guys to focus on their business, while this program will manage the compliance end of the patient.", "Jacob Messina", "Okay, great. And should we assume that the revenue impact is immaterial and dilution is immaterial as well?", "Donald Darkin", "At this case -- at this time, yes, absolutely. It's immaterial to us.", "Peter C. Farrell", "The maximum would be $0.01 a share and it probably won't even get to that. And a year out, it will be accretive.", "Jacob Messina", "And then maybe just quickly on the med tech tax. If you had any further update on how it will impact you all? And how you might handle it?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, there hasn't been any greater clarification in that space. And as far as we're concerned, we're making the assumption that it may well impact -- we're not sure about this, but it might impact the dental appliance area, the Narval products. But they're almost an immaterial part of our business at this point. So therefore, it doesn't affect current numbers at all. And maybe some of the hospital-based products, Stellar 100, 150 perhaps might accrue, but we're talking, 2.3%. But again, it's not really a material amount. Now if it affects all the products, you can do the math there. That is 2.3%. But there's a lot more water that's going to flow onto the bridge in this space. And we're not, at this point -- we're more concerned about Obamacare, which is a shambles in our view than the tax itself and maybe it won't even be implemented with a bit of luck.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "So just to clarify what you said on the medical device tax there. So that's not in the guidance for SG&A that was given earlier in the call, correct?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. Michael, it's Brett here. Yes, that's correct. I mean, it's still -- as Peter said, it's just too uncertain for us to know what -- which within our portfolio what products are in or out. We certainly think we'll get a clearer view of that when the final regulations come out. I think we expect them sometime in September. But there's even -- I mean, even within the industry and peers and so on, there's even conjecture about where does the medical device tax sit, does it sit in COGS, SG&A, where is it going to sit. So even that's not perfectly clear right now. But I think as we get to September, we'll get the final regulations. I think we'll certainly have some more clarity around that for you.", "Peter C. Farrell", "But Michael, we are reasonably sure, at least our internal tax guy has checked with a lot of sources. We think it's -- and again, we need clarification, as Brett said, but we think it's -- the impact is going to be fairly minimal for us that is.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And that's -- is that because the products are essentially considered to be sold at retail to patients? Or...", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. We think of it -- it does impact, as I said, the dental end of our business, which of course is not material at this point. We're planning on making it material, of course and also any hospital-based products. That's as far as we're reading the 2 at least. And we're fairly comfortable with that.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay, all right. So just moving on. I mean, you got the question on competitive bidding, but I guess the other Medicare change is this the resupply policy where the HMEs now have to sort of somehow verify that the equipment is no longer functioning before they can replace it, I guess, for masks and tubing and things like that. So what is your expectation of the impact, if any, that, that will have on your mask and accessories business?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I think it's a sensible approach by the government. I mean, it's -- if people aren't using it, you shouldn't be sending masks out. So I think that most people are just -- it's going to make them become more systematic and make sure that the patient needs it. But frankly, we think this is really a storm in a teacup. We are seeing less than 2 masks a year being used per device as it stands and the -- and CMS allows 4. So we're not even pushing the side. It's not a boundary condition for us. So I would say it's not something that we're the least bit concerned about. And I think it's tightening up the system and I think it's sensible that this is being done. But, Mick, do you want to make a comment?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Michael, it's Mick here. I would just add 2 points that firstly, this is just an opportunity for us to support our customers. It's only 20% of their business, so 25% of their business that's affected just the Medicare component. But it gives us a chance to talk to them about resupply, which has a lot of runway left for growth. And secondly, the customers that we're talking with over these last couple of months since this reasonably nebulous legislation came out is that they've swiftly added into their IVRs or their call center scripts and their documentation, steps that are necessary to show that it's nonfunctional in the replacement process. So that's been the chance. The good business conversations, we think, there's growth left. And our customers are responding swiftly and efficiently. And we think it's probably a good thing for us long-term to start thinking this way.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess just one more question and I'll be done. The -- you mentioned that the PCP is taking a bigger role and it's something that seems -- does seem to be happening with home testing. How do you view that? And do you think that's a good thing or bad thing? And since they're served somewhat outside of your call point, I mean, how do you ensure that those patients are ending up with ResMed equipment when you've been calling on the sleep labs to kind of convincing them to write out branded prescriptions. But if it's really dictated by a primary care doctor, then it may leave it more in sort of the hands of the HME as to what type of equipment they end up with?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. Look, that's a good question. Years ago, we were working with Philips within Respironics in order to educate PCPs about the existence of sleep-disordered breathing. That program has now stopped, all the primary care physicians, not all of them. But most of them, the bulk of them understand sleep-disordered breathing. And what they are left familiar with is the connection with signs and symptoms of the various co-morbidities that they're dealing with. And if you look at this area, and as I said, this should be -- sleep testing should be standard of care, you couldn't produce enough sleep physicians in 100 years to deal with the patients that have sleep-disordered breathing. We think internally, the prevalence of adults is that's at some level of an AHI greater than 5 is close to 30%.  I mean, Susan Redline at Harvard is using a figure of 25%. The Canadians are using a figure of 26%. In short, it is impossible for the sleep infrastructure to handle the numbers of patients. So we, in fact, have to market to the PCPs. The question is how do you do it? And the easiest way to do it is through social media. And so we're working on a number of initiatives in this space. We've worked with the Joslin Clinic at Harvard to try to educate PCPs about the fact that nearly 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes, whose first call point are the internist PCPs family physicians and so forth. So it's kind of a long-term play if you like, Michael.  We're well and truly into it. We're targeting them. And it sort of -- the analogy is with asthma and diabetes without worrying about the SDB and diabetes. If every asthmatic patient had to see a respirologist, or every diabetic patient had to see an endocrinologist, the system would simply freeze. And given the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, which is roughly 3x what it is for asthma and diabetes. We absolutely have to educate the PCPs. The good news is we're finding now, with the push towards pre-authorization with HST going to AutoSet. I just mentioned that the end of last year, it was 15% going to 25%. I think it will be, this time, next year, could even be 50%, because United is going to run the program out in November. And you're going to see some -- a really big acceleration of HST to APAP. This is a much easier route for -- you don't have to be a sleep physician to understand HST and the use of AutoSet. So we are very encouraged about the information we've got back thus far. A lot of work, a lot of water that flow into this, a lot of work to do. But we think this is a perfect area to focus on. Again, Mick, do you want to say something?", "Michael J. Farrell", "The only thing I'd add is that in terms of influencing ResMed brand, I think is where you're also asking, Michael, that we're working with sleep physician key opinion leaders from Harvard and Stanford, but also in regional groups around the country. And we have very strong relationships with the sleep physicians in terms of influencing towards not only the awareness of sleep apnea but that ResMed's products and services are ideally treated to keep the patient adherent, which is the big message. And we're also, in addition to that, doing some e-learning approaches with both the primary care physicians and train the trainer approaches with HME sales forces. So reaching the 250,000 primary care physicians can be done through social media, e-learning and by leveraging key opinion leader sources is what I'd add to what you just heard there.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And without sort of beating a dead horse here, just to add a little bit of more flavor, with the PCPs, we're seeing -- it's almost a bifurcation. There may be many more phenotypes as we get more information back. But you have the PCPs that are kind of interested in doing the HST, not necessarily in putting the patients on treatment, that would be done by, as you correctly pointed out, by the -- currently, both the DMEs or the HMEs. But they would end up with a $50 or something around that order. And then there are the PCPs that actually don't want to get involved, and they are using the IDTFs. So in other words, if they recognize the patient needs help, they can just sort of say, \"Well, here, listen, why don't you go and we'll give you a list of IDTFs, and you can pick a geographically close one or one with a national footprint.\" But we're seeing roughly that. And there'll be more clarity over the next few months in that area, maybe over the next 6 months.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I wanted to touch base on a couple of things, following up on of the earlier question. Peter, I know you're under 2 masks per year on average for patients. Can you talk about the typical experience in terms of when a mask actually wears out, how it does? And is that 2x or 3x a year for a compliant patient? Or is it the 1.6x that you all are getting at this point? And I know that's not necessarily why people are getting the mask today. But do you think there could be a transitional issue as we go through this that needs new requirements? And just kind of talk about those 2 points, if you would.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, Ben, it's like asking how long is a piece a string, what causes a mask to wear out. Again, if -- I mean, there are all sorts reasons. The dog gets it, puts a hole in it, and it leaks or the patient has a particularly oily face and the material itself breaks down. All sorts of reasons, some people are very, very careful, they clean their mask, they look after it and so on and so forth. So there's all sorts of things that can happen out there. But our average is of the order -- it's a little a shade under 2, and that's all we can really say about that. But, Don, you might want to make a comment there. But it's really the DMEs and the HMEs working with the patients.  And it's up to them to do it. We just don't get involved with that.", "Donald Darkin", "Yes. I agree with Peter, Ben. It's a very difficult area to really understand. It's very patient-specific, and you get quite a variability in the numbers. But generally, it's sitting around that 1.5 plus. And I think as people understand the importance of compliance and understand the importance of getting good, comfortable, effective masks, then they'll start to realize that, that number might creep up a little bit, but obviously it's a slow process at this point.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And I'll hazard a guess here. Ben, that with the switch to HST, and I really think that's going to accelerate. There are different views with -- even within ResMed about that. I'm -- you can call me optimistic, I just think it's going to really pick up hugely. It's going to be adopted fairly rapidly. And with that, the patients are going to be going on to AutoSet. And the beauty of the AutoSet is you get really good, solid information on mask leak and how the patient is doing.  And it gives the HMEs and the DMEs the opportunity to say, hey, listen, you seem -- your treatment seems to be suboptimal. It could be the mask and ask them to check their mask or even bring the stuff in, and we'll take a look at it. So I think were going to see that number creeping up.", "Donald Darkin", "I thought -- just add one more thing there. I think as patients become more aware of the disease, are more aware of the importance of compliance for themselves, they will take control of that mask number as well, and I believe that will drive it even higher.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And so it would be consumer-driven.", "Donald Darkin", "Exactly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk about the buyback. I think this year was a record year for shares bought back, just wondering how you're thinking about that looking forward.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. Well, I'll trade that one to Brett -- I mean, as you know, we've got an active program with 3.6 million shares into it. There's another 8.8 million shares approved. Basically, we think it's based on our feelings -- more than feelings, based on our projections. We think it's just damn good value. Brett, do you want to add any more flavor to that?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. It's Brett. We'll continue with the buyback. I think at this stage, we expect the buyback -- to buy back a minimum of stock to at least offset dilution from employee equity grants. So as you look at last year, that would be roughly 2 million shares. So I suppose that would be the starting point. But as Peter said, we'll -- that will be a starting point and likely to be more than that. But we have now the dividend as well that we'll be paying on a quarterly basis. But I don't think it's an either/or, I think we'll both do the dividend and continue with the share buyback as well.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "But is it -- so it's unlikely to be as strong as it was this year at around 30 million shares?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. I mean, it was pretty significant this year.   I mean, that's getting to quite a significant proportion of our shares that we did buy back. So I think with the context of the dividend now being paid, you'd probably expect that wouldn't be quite as aggressive as what we had done this year.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "But is it fair to assume the share count might fall again?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, I think so. Well, I think you could definitely predict that.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Definitely. You can pick a number, I mean.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank.", "Nicholas  Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "This is Nick Cameron, going for David Low. Brett,  perhaps just a couple of quick questions to you and then one for Dr. Farrell. Firstly, Brett, Singapore manufacturing, just roughly what percentage does that represent now and how much more have you got to go there?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. On the Singapore manufacturing, it's probably roughly at the 50% -- about 50% of the production in Singapore now. And we've always said that, that -- what's happening there is incremental production continues to flow up to Singapore. We've also started heavy manufacturing in Malaysia as well now. So we have a small operation in Malaysia to really supplement that Singapore operation now. So it's 50%, and you expect over time that percentage will climb.", "Nicholas  Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just quickly on the payout ratio implied by this result, can we sort of expect that going forward? Or is it a flat $0.17?", "David Pendarvis", "Well, it's -- well, I mean, the board will determine the dividend policy. And at this stage, let me say, it's $0.17 a quarter.", "Nicholas  Cameron - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, no problem. And then, for Dr. Farrell, if he may. I just want to get your feeling on how you're seeing compliance in the eyes of the payers at the moment on some of the product side. So I just wanted to see what your thoughts are on that. And what it is, you think, they're looking for and will ultimately come up with in the end?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I think people are recognizing that compliance is the ace in the whole. If you don't get compliance, everybody loses. In other words, a machine that's bought and gets stuck in a cupboard, you don't get replenishment and so on, so that's all obvious. But I would put it more strategically. What we do know is that patients have significantly improved quality of life. We also know -- and the data, I was referring to it in my initial comments, I mean, you've got the co-morbidities are not just heart disease and diabetes, it's peripheral neuropathy, it's cancer and so on and so forth. So it actually, treatment -- compliant treatment prevents disease progression. And we also have a significant amount of data internally. And there was a recent report about a year ago from McKinsey, which is on the Harvard website -- the Harvard Sleep Medicine website, showing that there's a return on investment in the first year for treating patients, and that is with a reduction in inpatient and outpatient services. So it's kind of like the holy grail, improve quality of life, reduce costs and stopping the progression of disease. People are becoming more and more aware of that aspect. And so compliance is the holy grail in itself for the patient. It's a holy grail, if you are compliant, for the reasons I just mentioned. I think that word is getting out, and it's -- the CMS -- actually the government did something senseful, it's sort of hard to believe, it's not often you see that. But by requiring this 90 days with 30 days continuous use, that's the CMS, this is forcing the DMEs and the HMEs to look very, very seriously at compliance because they don't get paid if the patient isn't compliant. So we've seen in some of the bigger customers, compliance sub-50 going to mid-70s. So we're seeing and maybe that's reflected also in the incredible growth that we're seeing in our replenishment program. It's getting better and better. And of course the other side of the coin is that our products are better and better. I mean, you've got much more like 75 gram masks, machines that are about a kilogram, 24 decibels, I mean, they're quiet, they're small, they're appealing and they're so much, so much easier to use. So everything is moving in the right direction. The technology is, the knowledge of the -- both the consumer and the physician, the improvements in technology and so forth. So we are seeing -- now I couldn't give you specific numbers, but I would say -- well I can give you a specific number, but it's not based on hard-nosed data, but it's somewhere around the mid-70s at one year. And once the patients are on after first month, we're seeing, even the first couple of weeks, we're seeing that, that's the way it tends to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got few number questions for Brett and then a few for Dr. Farrell and the rest of the team. So Brett, just on the FX overall, given the rising shift of manufacturing to Singapore and later down onto Malaysia. Do we still have a 6-month lag as it relates to shifts in the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. I mean, we're still -- still a decent chunk of those costs are in the manufacturing front. So we're still -- yes, it would be probably just overauarter. You could rule of thumb probably a quarter delay. Now we've -- if you look at inventory turnover for us now, it has improved quite a bit over the last few years. So I think the rule of thumb would be on about a quarter's lag on impact from the Aussie dollar.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then just to stay on that, is about 30% of R&D still local in Australia? And does that still play the one quarter lag as well further down the P&L?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. I mean, so the majority -- much more than that, the majority of the R&D is undertaken here in Australia. But that impact we feel straight away through normal translation. So you'll see that whatever the average rate is for the quarter, that would be reflected in our R&D spend.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And Dr. Farrell, one product question. In late July, CareFusion actually announced a Class I recall of its EnVe Ventilator. And about a year ago, I guess ResMed and CareFusion now have the distribution relationship with the Stellar 100 and 150. So I'm wondering, due to that recall, do you see an incremental opportunity for Stellar 100 and 150?", "Peter C. Farrell", "I'm going to give that one to Geoff Neilson. I don't know what Geoff's about to say. But I think it's almost no impact as far as -- from where I see it. But, Geoff?", "Geoff Neilson", "They're playing in different segments in the hospitals. So really, it's not going to have any impact.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right, perfect. And then last one for me and I'll get back in. Just to go back to competitive bidding. Fully understanding your comments that you're not seeing any impact, but as we look into the beginning of 2013 when the program actually gets extended, not so much that there'll be a permanent impact on the part of DMEs to sort of reposition how they negotiate with manufacturers.  But do you envision any initial knee-jerk reaction as you move into and get up to 90 MSAs? And to that respect should we expect to -- maybe a moderation from low double-digit growth into the back end of '13?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Anthony, sort of reiterating what I've said there. We -- the first 9 MSAs we, sort of if anything, it was a slightly -- and it sounds bizarre, slightly positive impact on ASPs. We're not quite sure why that is. But let's say it had -- it virtually had no impact. We don't see -- and we've looked at this pretty carefully because people seem to be spooked by it. But our data show that it is not really having any impact at all. Now that could change, but I don't see it. We just don't see it.  And again, it's 10% -- it's of the order of 10% of our total global revenues. So -- but I mean, we don't even see it impacting that 10%. The other people do apparently, but we just don't. And we are talking about real data, not guesses.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Stanton with Nomura.", "David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I wonder if you could give us an update on growth rates in the U.S. for bilevels and APAP compared to the overall machine growth rate? That's my first question.", "Peter C. Farrell", "David, we don't give that sort of granularity. What we have said is that we're incredibly encouraged by our -- but since the bilevels have been put into the S9 platform, we're seeing some very encouraging growth, very encouraging. And as I just said, we're releasing the VPAP ST and the VPAP ST-A in -- also in the S9 platform, and we expect to see that being received positively. The other thing I mentioned is the HST-driven switch -- lastly, HST-driven switch too, what I said. And we expect that to continue and we're expecting in fact another 100% increase in HST, and the obvious way to go is to put patients on auto-setting devices. So we expect to see a modest to very poor growth in the low-end CPAPs and quite good growth in the high-end CPAPs. And bilevels and AutoSets, we see continuing to grow.", "David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Great. And could you give us -- as my final question, give us an update on what you think market growth rates are at present in the U.S. and EU? Are you guys gaining share, I guess, is my ultimate question.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. Well you would say -- so we haven't changed our view on where we are with growth rates. It's 6% to 8%, and pretty much worldwide. Maybe it's a little higher in Asia Pac because it's starting from a lower base. So you might be able to say 8% to 10% in Asia Pac, possibly a little higher in China or in India, but it's not reached a point where it's hugely material for us just yet. But 6% to 8%, for the bulk of our business, that is Europe and the U.S. And as you saw, our constant currency growth was 13%, so that would be suggestive of market share gains. And the rate of growth for both devices, 9% in the U.S. for devices and 13% for masks. That would suggest that we're doing nicely.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Louisa Abdo.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is actually Matt Prior. Peter, if I could ask -- and maybe if Ann is on the line or if you want to pick this one to Brett. But with rest of world growth being so strong and we had anticipated the Japan would kick back in this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about Europe versus Japan? And specifically, I guess is the margin better in Asia? Or -- sorry, your business in Asia, I should say. And is the margin better in Asia than it is versus Europe? And is that one of the reasons why we saw a slightly better GM than I think the market was looking for this quarter?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, Asia Pac had been soft for a couple of quarters and it's come back full steam, whether it was the tsunami, some of that was in there, psychological issues, if you like. Asia Pac has now good growth back on stream. And we -- I referred to the challenging economic climate in Europe, I mean. However, despite that, Germany was extremely encouraging. The U.K. almost hit it out of the ballpark. But you've got obviously huge challenges in Spain, Italy and France, where there's ASP pressures. But we grew constant currency, 13% in Europe, which was pretty damn good and significantly higher than that in Asia Pac. With respect to margins, we don't really get down to talking about -- I will say slightly better margins in Asia Pac. But it's not something that is of great importance to us. I don't know whether -- Brett, do you want to add to that or Rob?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, thanks. The only thing I'd say on that is, Matt, is geographic mix wasn't really a driver of the margin. So that probably pretty much answers it.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Rob is going to add something.", "Robert Douglas", "Just to the -- markets in Asia Pac are generally higher in product. So they are -- that supports the margins a little bit and also some of the smaller Norther European countries did very well as well, so it's a mixed bag there, but netted out really good.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one follow-up question and given I know Geoff is on the call. Geoff, if I can talk to you on ventilation just given that there was reference to mix in that positive U.S. Flow Gen number. I think, and obviously you already talked to some extent about the CareFusion relationship on the call, but certainly to the 9% number we saw for U.S. Flow Gen, do you see, I guess, the Stellar and ventilation contributing to that yet at somewhat of a meaningful level? Or are we still waiting for the ventilation market for ResMed in the U.S. to take flight? And I guess the final point to that is do you see competitive bidding, the medical device tax, Obamacare, slowing down any of the kind of hospital purchase decisions around ventilation products over the next 1 or 2 quarters before it really gets a head of steam?", "Geoff Neilson", "Okay. First of all on Stellar, globally, it's been growing very well. In the U.S., it's still in early days with CareFusion. We are seeing growth, but it's off a small base. And as far as all the other macroeconomic things, ResMed's presence in the hospital is small and not material at the moment. We obviously have plans to grow that. And so these issues aren't material at the moment.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. I'm sorry, Peter, if I can ask just one last one? Linde's acquisition of Lincare, that was a fairly big event for the sector given that we are in the midst of, as you talked about, competitive bidding concerns. Does that reinforce, I guess, your view that currently Linde doesn't see big concerns around competitive bidding because they're making acquisitions like they have with Lincare?", "Peter C. Farrell", "All right. You've taken the words out of my mouth. It was a very decent premium that Lincare got, so $41 a share or whatever. It's a very decent -- I mean, premium. So clearly, Linde is seeing competitive bidding as being, I would say, a nonissue. I mean, they paid big bucks. And as far as the impact upon us, I mean, we can only go on what's written in the press releases and so forth. We haven't had any in-depth discussion with either Linde or Lincare management on this. But the press releases say that they're going to be run separately. And John Byrnes, the CEO of Lincare is still in the saddle. And so we treat -- they're both big customers, but we treat it as business as usual.", "So good luck to Lincare and the boys. And you've said it yourself, competitive bidding doesn't seem to have much of an impact on what could be considered a very, very generous premium.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question on Europe. Just wondering if you can provide any granularity or detail around the contribution of ventilation growth versus pure CPAP growth just in that specific market?", "Peter C. Farrell", "We've always done reasonably well in the ventilation space in Europe, France and so forth. France was, as I said, was a little soft. There are price pressures occurring there. I -- there's nothing really that stands out. Geoff, do you want to comment on?", "Geoff Neilson", "I think and particularly in the noninvasive ventilation area, we're seeing strong growth both with our ST devices and with Stellar devices. And the life support products are holding their own, but mostly the growth is in NIV area, which is -- where the growth in ventilation is actually occurring.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "All right. And just one last question back to the U.S.. Just this shift from lower-end CPAP to APAP, it's something you guys have been talking about for quite a long time. I'm just wondering how much room there still is for that mix shift effect within your portfolio as a percentage of, I guess, not asking for data on percentage split between the 2. But over how long do you think this trend will continue to play out for your specific business?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, we think it's -- the potential is there for it to accelerate. And the reason being the push to HST is building up an an incredible storm, if you like -- or maybe slightly less than a storm. But it's happening. And growing at 50% per annum, this is going to be reflected in more switching to AutoSet. It's happening. So -- and how long will it continue? I see it continuing for several years.", "Michael J. Farrell", "So one -- this is Mick here. One proxy to look at is the fact that we're 15% switched to home sleep testing from PSG, and we expect that to continue. So there's 85% of the runway left in terms of the potential switch from PSG to HST. So that could be a proxy metric you could look at -- to that as a suggestion.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, at the end of this year, we expect that to be 75%. But that's still a fair chunk...", "Michael J. Farrell", "Still lot of runway.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Fair -- yes, a lot of runway.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dr. Farrell for any closing remarks.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, thank you, Chris. I think we've said enough and we'll let people go. Those that are still on the -- and I guess the final thing I'd like to say is to just thank all the ResMed employees for doing another outstanding job. We have a great team of people. And I just want to publicly thank all our employees. So thanks, guys. See you next time, as they say.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

(NYSE:RMD) Q3 2007 Earnings Call  November  1, 2007  5:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Peter C. Farrell - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President ", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Analysts", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Tim Lee - Caris & Company", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, the company has asked me to address certain matters.First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of thisconference call for any purpose. Second, during the call ResMed may makeforward-looking statements such as projections of the future revenue orearnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. ", "These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist thatcould cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-lookingstatements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would like it turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell,ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead. ", "Peter Farrell", "Thank you, Jeremy, very much. Let me start straight into it. Revenue for thequarter was $185.7 million, around $186 million, an increase of 14% over theyear ago quarter. Pro forma income from operations was $40.4 million, and proforma net income was $30.6 million. ", "Pro forma diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39, an increase of 5% comparedto the '06 September quarter. GAAP operating income was $31.8 million for thequarter, while net income was $24.1 or $0.31 per diluted share. GAAP grossmargin was $60.2 for the quarter ended September 30, '07. ", "Let me note that the closing price on the U.S. dollar to the Aussie was$0.75 a year ago quarter and this quarter was $0.89, so there was a 19%increase due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and that's basicallyunprecedented. If we run that through EPS, it\u2019s about $0.0125. So that is apretty big hit. ", "Pro forma SG&A for the quarter was $59 million, an increase of $8.5million or 17%. Pro forma SG&A costs were 32% of revenue for this quarterjust ended, compared to 31% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP SG&A was$62.9 million, 18% up, and in constant currency terms pro forma SG&A costsincreased by 11% compared to the same period a year ago. ", "Again, we were a hit by the depreciating U.S. dollar, which flowed throughto, as I already mentioned to EPS, and we're looking at 11% constant currencyversus the actual number of 18%. So that's quite a hit. ", "Pro forma R&D expenditure was $12.6 million, 7% of revenues. GAAPvirtually the same, $13 million, again 7% of revenues and this increased 20%over the year ago quarter and again U.S. depreciation, U.S. dollar depreciationwas a significant contributor to the 20% R&D expense and in constantcurrency was actually 9%. ", "Amortization of acquired intangibles, $1.8 million, $1.2 net of tax and theamortization of assets was associated with various acquisitions. Stock basedcompensation during the quarter was as expected, $4.5 million, $3.4 million netof tax.", "Restructuring, there was a restructuring cost for a Baseloffice downsizing, $2.3 million. And as noted there is another $200,000, whichwill hit the quarter that we're currently in. Inventory $167 million, increasedby $9.9 million, and DSO\u2019s at 79 days were essentially consistent with the JuneDSO\u2019s. ", "In the first quarter of the fiscal year '08, overall American sales were up9%, but actually 11% when we take into account the motor division sales orexcluding those. And parenthetically let me note that was around $300,000, inthe year ago quarter it was $2.1 million. ", "So, there was a loss there of $1.8 million and going forward the comparablesare going to be a little more favorable to us. Sales outside of the Americas,$88.1 million, an encouraging 19% increase year-over-year, and operating cashflow for the quarter just ended the September quarter, $28.1 million and that'sfairly encouraging, that compares with a net income of $24.1 million. ", "A couple of comments, the new full face mask offerings, the Quattro and theLiberty, are going extremely well. They're excellent products and in our viewmore than competitive and allows us to keep a price differential. ", "We're also excited about the launch of our new S8, an extremely quiet S8 IIflow generator. It has been launched in Asia Pac and selected European markets,in particular Germany.We have incorporated in this our Easy-Breathe technology, really improved motorcharacteristics and if one combines the Swift II with the S8 II, the Whisper,it is the quietest CPAP on the market, and in fact the S8 II has a noise levelof around 23 decibels, which is basically below our ability to hear. ", "In fact, we had reports back from some customers saying that they had toactually touch the device to make sure it was actually operating, and there isnot much vibration there, either. So we remain very confident about marketfundamentals and we have some new products on the horizon. And we're hopeful aswe move forward in fiscal '08, Q3, Q4, we're hopeful of achieving our moreusual growth pattern for the people that have been expecting over the pastdecade or so. ", "I will also note finally, that we have an extremely strong balance sheet,cash, cash equivalents, $278 million and our retained earnings are gettingclose to $0.5 billion are actually a shade over $460, but very close to $0.5billion in retained earnings. So, we have a very strong balance sheet, whichgives us flexibility. ", "So now let me throw it open to Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Choiwith Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon, Peter.", "Peter Farrell", "Paul, how are you?", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Fine, thank you. Let me first say congratulations to you and also to Kieranon the recent announcement there, and best of luck to both of you here.", "Peter Farrell", "Thank you, Paul.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thank Paul.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Maybe for my first question here, just if I could focus on the grossmargin here, historically I think in terms of your business mix we've usuallyseen an up tick in masks as a percentage of revenue here in the first quarterversus the previous quarter, which I think generally tends to help on you themargin side.", "But could you help us understand a little bit what effects contributed interms of your margin tick down here, and also what factor are sort of priceplayed in here in terms of the sequential gross margin decline?", "Peter Farrell", "Right, well the first point is, which I have are already alluded to, Paul,is that we had an unprecedented 19% increase in our costs just simply due tothe depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Aussie. The closingcurrency was $0.75 U.S. to $1 Aussie dollar a year ago quarter and now it was$0.89, and I think today it has hit $0.93.", "So this is that's unprecedented. However, having said that, there werecertainly price pressures, ASPs, which we talked about on the previous twoearnings calls. There has been pressure due to our major competitor droppingprices significantly buy 7, get 10 type of activity, so on the lower endproducts this obviously impacted the gross margin.", "We think it looks as though, as best we can assess it looks as though thepricing has stabilized, and Keith you might want to make a comment on that inthe U.S. whichis where most of the price pressure was. We still are getting because of thequality of our products; we're still getting a 10% to 15% up tick in our masks.We expect that to continue.", "The Swift II, the Quattro and the Libertyare extremely good products. We're very happy with them. But as far as grossmargin going forward, as we look into the wild blue yonder, with the U.S.dollar as I said trading at around $0.93 to the Aussie dollar as of thismorning.", "We'll be looking at around a 60 to 61 mark, but probably more likely a 60 asfar as we can see. Do you to make a comment, Keith or Brett?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Actually, this is Kieran. Let me just add one thing to that. We have notbeen, as you're suggesting, we have not seen in the United States and some ofthe other, actually some of the European countries, we have not seen prices gobelow where we saw them, sort of the most aggressive deals several months ago.", "What we are seeing is it is sort of going across the market now, and you'reseeing more customers getting those similar prices. So the positive sign hereis it appears that there\u2019s a floor that has been established here for a numberof months, and the market dynamic is that we'll see those prices go to abroader range of customers over time.", "So pretty much what we expected to see is it is pretty much what we've beensaying here the last three, four months that we expected to see throughout thisyear, and I don't think there\u2019s any change in that dynamic at that point.", "Peter Farrell", "Okay.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Then in just maybe as my follow-up, the international growth up tickeda little bit here, it looks like to rates we haven't seen here in a couple ofquarters. Can you help us sort of parse out maybe what the currency benefit wasor are we starting to see deeper penetration overseas?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes, I think, with the exception of Germany, we had extremely strong growth.And Germany, we're through that, unfortunately, Lasse Beijer is traveling,arrives in Australia later today, but Germany is softer than we would like.", "We've done what we believe we need to do in Germany.It is a work in progress, but even given Germanybeing weaker than we would like, the results were pretty good, and the constantcurrency figures, Brett, do you have that in front of you?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. It conceptually the impact on revenues of the appreciating Euro andAussie pretty much added around $6 million to the revenue number for thisquarter.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Tim Lee with Caris & Company.You may proceed.", "Tim Lee - Caris & Company", "Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Peter Farrell", "How are you, Tim?", "Tim Lee - Caris & Company", "Just in the U.S.,with pricing somewhat stabilizing, are we turning the corner and we can kind ofthink of this quarter as the low water mark and we can move up here from growthhere on a going-forward basis?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, Tim, I think we flagged last earnings call, in fact, I know we did.The first two quarters of '08 were going to be a struggle, and that's mainlybecause of the comparables, I mean we have got the ResMed motor technologieswhich we talked about on the last couple of calls.", "We've still got a couple of million there, and as you know, the sales therehave basically gone very far south. So we still got top comparables for Q2 '08,and I think as we look into the future, Q3 and Q4 look pretty comfortable forus.", "Tim Lee - Caris & Company", "And just in terms, one quick follow-up on the international side again. The18% growth, I mean that's not a blended number, so what is the internationalgrowth ex-Germany, so give us a sense of what growth could get to once Germanygets back on track.", "Peter Farrell", "Love to answer that, Tim, but that's not on the agenda.", "Tim Lee - Caris & Company", "Thought I'd try.", "Peter Farrell", "But thanks for the question.", "Tim Lee - Caris & Company", "All right, I'll get back in queue. Thank you.", "Peter Farrell", "Okay.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Good afternoon, Peter.", "Peter Farrell", "How are you, Ben?", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Very well, thanks.", "Peter Farrell", "Good.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "And just maybe being a bit more specific on some of the P&L items, ifyou back out currency completely from the equation, what is the overall impacton EPS, by your calculations?", "Peter Farrell", "I will throw that to Brett. My rough calculation is $0.015. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, if you roll it through and watch all accounting impact through and tryand model that, Ben, when we had a look at it, I think it is in the order of$0.01 to $0.015 for EPS, so the previous number there is pretty much spot-on asyou roll it through.", "That's the sort of impact. If you look at that against overall net income,you're looking at about a 4%, roughly that sort of number, impact fromcurrency. You can't be levels stay as they are, and that\u2019s probably what willend up washing through the course of '08. So that's pretty much the impact aswe see it at the moment.", "Peter Farrell", "The bottom line, Ben, is that it is not fair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Let's call the Fed and tell them to start raising rates.", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah, well, somebody has got to help.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "My follow-up question then is, as you think about the sheer magnitude of newproducts that you've got flowing through, Peter, why aren't we seeing bettertraction in sales?", "I mean, is price just that flat-out important to people but with salesgrowth, I should say, with the Quattro, the Liberty, all the different thingscoming through, why isn't that having a bigger impact?", "Peter Farrell", "Well again, Kieran referred to the price spread, and that's just somethingthat's happened. It is hard to get an actual, definite figure, how many of thecustomers does it flow through to, but I suspect we're through all of that. Myguess would be 90%.", "So, you\u2019ve got those lower prices. Now it is mainly impacting the S8 Escape,the Tango, that lower end that 25% issue of the market.", "We've been able to maintain, as I already indicated, 10% to 15% higherprices for the masked products, and we're doing extremely well with theorder-setting products, and of course the VPAP Adapt SV, I mean, Respironics havecome out with their competitive product, and they're hammering that prettywell.", "We're very confident that as people get exposed to our algorithm, with the Easy-Breathetechnology and the much easier ease of use of our products, and they'repre-emptive.", "That is and we've had a couple of cases where patients just have not donewell on the competitive product, and have switched to the VPAP Adapt SV, or theACS II as it is outside the U.S. It\u2019s just avery robust unit.", "Now, there is a lot of stuff that's got to wash through, but we are very,very happy with the Swift II, the Quattro, and the Liberty.", "Traditionally, you do see an up tick when we come out with new products, andwe are doing well with them, but it is a balance between the price pressuresand, as Kieran mentioned, flowing through particularly the U.S. market, whichis 53% of our total revenues of the Americas, and it just is what it is.", "I mean it is sort of inexplicable. We looked at some of those actions, andit\u2019s not exactly logical to us. Maybe it is a game plan there.", "But since there were no real price pressures coming from the customers, theDME\u2019s and the HME\u2019s, it was just a grab for market share, and we just didn'tjump over the cliff.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "But, is it fair to say that unit volumes you would normally expect with anew product cycle are coming through but they're being partially offset byprice?", "Peter Farrell", "Correct.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "So you are not saying\u2026", "Peter Farrell", "You should have answered my questions; you should have answered yourquestion.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "I am just trying to get\u2026", "Peter Farrell", "That's it in a nutshell.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "You're not disappointed by the unit volume on the new products, though?", "Peter Farrell", "No.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Not at all, the new products are doing very, very well. The challenge reallycomes down to on some of the existing products where we have premiums thatstart to, the delta in pricing between our closest competitors start to getabove that 10% to 15% range, when they start to get to 20% to 25%, there isvolume implications on that.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Right, but the\u2026", "Kieran Gallahue", "But the new products are doing great.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "But your unit volume growth overall for the masks and generators issatisfying, but it is being partially offset by price.", "Peter Farrell", "Right, now, look, you can always if you look at individual products, and yousay well, why that isn\u2019t doing better, et cetera. I think we talked about theTango, and it\u2019s a terrific unit, but it is in fact D featured.", "I mean in terms of its characteristics, operating characteristics, noise, etcetera, you can tick all the boxes, but it doesn't have EPR on it, and we'veseen that our guys are just not as good as selling into that low or essentialcare model as Apria calls it, selling into thatspace.", "So that hasn't gone as well as we would have liked. I might say that it'simproved, and there was the distraction of the recall, that's where we'reworking through that, but we're going to have to live with that through to theend of fiscal year, but it is much less frenetic.", "I mean, it's down from spending a quarter's of the guy's times on theaverage to around 10% to 15%, that did still having a small impact, but againas I said, it is fading.", "But yeah, at the lower end there which is, call it 25% to 30% of the market,and the price pressures are pretty significant, and the competition has beendropping their prices in their featured units, and that makes it a difficult spaceto operate in.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. Thank you.", "Peter Farrell", "Keith, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.", "Keith Serzen", "No, Peter, I think you did a fine job with that.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro withBanc of America Securities. Go ahead.", "Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Peter, on your guidance for the second half,you commented that you expected growth to get back to more market-like growth,and I am assuming you're referring to top line.", "Peter Farrell", "Yes.", "Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "So a couple of questions, do you view market growth as 15% or closer to 20%,and just to piggyback off of Ben's questions, are you referring to unit growthbeing back to market because I would imagine you're still going to face somepricing pressures on a year-over-year basis in the back end of the year?", "So that's a question one. If you can answer, and then you didn't mentionanything about the SA recall. Should we assume at this point it is completelybehind you? Thanks.", "Peter Farrell", "Okay. Let me take your first question, Glenn. We are talking unit growth. Infact, we were at a conference yesterday and there was a big discussion.", "There was a panel discussion where people from the U.S.were hooked in and so on and so forth. I am in Sydney.", "And the general consensus, and there is a bit of an echo chamber to thissort of thing, like you start believing your own echoes a little bit, but westill believe that outside the U.S. it is around 15%, and that's ROW ingeneral, and in the U.S. it\u2019s around 20%, and we are indeed talking aboutvolumes of devices.", "Now, you can picture some scenarios where you can get an up tick goingforward, as we penetrate into some of the areas we're focusing on likeoccupational health and safety, for example.", "We are sort of optimistic, but at the moment as we look out there, I thinkyou can almost put the better volume growth of the order of 15% ROW and 20% inthe U.S.", "And again, you're quite right. The pricing pressures, the prices, theprices, they're not going to go away unless you innovate, and you've gotfeatures where people say, my God, I have always wanted one of those, whateverit is.", "We know that you can ask for and get higher prices. We are optimistic onsome of that stuff, but we can't talk about that specifically at the moment.", "Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Just from a modeling point of view, in our reported revenue numbers in ourmodels we should be a touch below that 15% to 20%, which would reflect some of thepricing pressures you'd still face on a year-over-year basis.", "Peter Farrell", "Or I think that's fair. I think that\u2019s fair. Now, on your second question,the recall, our estimate is that we're 30% to 40% through it, but the thing nowis it's going reasonably smoothly. I mean as well as these things can go thestuff that we do ourselves where we're well and truly on top of it andobviously we\u2019re using Stericycle.", "And when it is once removed from your control, you do tend to have thingsnot run at quite as smoothly, but I think on the average, and I will get Keithto comment on this, on the average I think we're fairly satisfied.", "We're satisfied with the amount of provisioning we made. We're satisfied, ifyou looked into the wild blue yonder and said we're a shade under 40% of theunits back, you'd say, well, we would like a higher number, but it is what itis.", "It is like you take your car in, and you get something in the mail, and yourMercedes, something wrong with the brakes, and I don't know what you do, but Iwait until my next service. So, there is a bit of that going on but, Keith, doyou want to add anything?", "Keith Serzen", "Peter, I believe that you've answered that adequately as well.", "Peter Farrell", "Okay, well, thank you.", "Keith Serzen", "We have the inventory under control, Stericycle has the process undercontrol, the start-up issues that you'd have anytime you go through somethingthis large are for the most part behind us, and I think we're gatheringmomentum with this very nicely, but it will be with us for the balance of thiscalendar year, as we said all along.", "Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Is it by any chance, again a piggybacking off of one of Ben's questions, asto why maybe you're not doing a little bit better with these launches becauseusually you do very well with a new product launch?", "Do you think, is there any more sales force distraction out there or is thatbehind us?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Glenn, what Peter had mentioned earlier on is that we still are getting somelevel of sales force distraction, hard to quantify it in specific terms.", "We estimate it to be in the 10% to 15% kind of a range, which means it hassome impact, but not much, certainly not like it was in the first quarter andactually at a declining rate as we move forward.", "And I would imagine that, as we get closer and closer to the end of thisthat any commitments of the sales force time on this will continue to getsmaller.", "Glenn Navarro - Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Peter Farrell", "And, Keith, I just listening to your answers, there I just wish you were onthe compensation committee.", "Operator", "Sir, your next question comes from the line of Mike Madsen with Wachovia. ", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "Thanks for taking my call.", "Peter Farrell", "Hi, Mike.", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "I guess first of all, just I know about this time last year, you all hadimplemented your internet policy, and I know it is a very small percentage ofyour sales, but I guess I believe that you're going to be lapping that startingin the December quarter, so that may give you a slight boost to your revenuegrowth.", "Is that a fair assessment?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes, I think it is. Keith is very close to the internet policy, and I thinkin fact Keith was the person who was most adamant that we really needed to putour foot down concerning internet sales. ", "And just to reiterate what we said before, that is because guys that areselling on the Internet feel no responsibility, at least a lot of them thatdon't have DME attached to it or an HME; they don't feel any responsibility tocall the patient because they don't get paid for it.", "So, we just think its bad medicine, but Keith, why don't you give us anupdate.", "Keith Serzen", "I just got a message from one of our Vice Presidents of Sales this morningthat told me about two customers in the northeastern part of the United  States that had made a decision within thelast two days to switch over all of their business to ResMed because we are theonly one with an internet policy.", "And we are getting more stories like that as people do understand what ourmessaging has been. They do understand the impact on patient care and theimpact on the DME service model, and are now beginning to take action on justhow they're directing their business.", "So, Mike, in answer to your question about whether we measure anything inrelationship to the anniversary date of our internet policy, I don't thinkwe've got it quantified like that in any way, shape or form.", "It is more of a gut-level check from what we're hearing from the sales forceas our customers understand the messaging that we've been trying to get acrossand are now taking action on that messaging. We remain very pleased with ourinternet policy, and we remain very committed to our internet policy.", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "All right.", "Peter Farrell", "I think what we actually would like is for some of our competitors, one inparticular, to follow suit. We just think it is just better medicine. If youdon't get compliance, everybody loses.", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "It is understandable, let's see. Just on competitive bidding, and Iapologize if this question has come up, I was on another conference call, butjust what are you hearing from the HMEs in the initial areas?", "I realize it\u2019s a very small portion of your revenues at this point, but justtrying to understand maybe what the longer-term impact of that will be? Do youhave any kind of sense of where the bids are ending up or anything along thoselines?", "Peter Farrell", "I am going to try that. You're quite right. It\u2019s not right in our sweet spotthere in terms of concerns. I am going to throw that again to Keith.", "Keith Serzen", "So we don't know where the bids are coming in yet. We, know just as you do,Mike, when the bids are coming in, and supposed to be sorted out. The long-termimpact of that,  who knows?", "It is really interesting to us that it seems that more of the bidders withina given marketplace seem to be not from that given marketplace, that we've gotpeople who haven't done business in a given market are now using this as anopportunity to try to expand their business models into a differentgeographical area.", "But in terms of, it basically is a discussion point for people in theindustry. It is a worry point for what the long range implications are, but youstill have a lot of people that wondering whether they will ever be able topull it off and go from the first ten MSAs to the second level with this.", "And once again as you heard us discuss many times before, it is still at theend of the day such a relatively small part of our business that we don't thinkit is going to have a material effect on our business.", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "Okay. And then just, can you provide an update on your sales forcestructure, just how much are they focusing on the sleep labs versus HME\u2019s,because I guess it seems like in the past I know I guess Respironics had mademore of a push into the sleep labs, and I know you guys probably had a presencein both, but just wondering if you can give us an update there?", "Keith Serzen", "Are you asking me to answer that question for the U.S.market, Mike?", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "More U.S.focused I guess, to be honest.", "Keith Serzen", "Okay. So we have for the last several years had an increased level of focuson the sleep lab with our sales reps as well as with our clinical team. Thatcontinues. We view the sleep labs as an incredibly important call point for us,both from a standpoint of the scripting that they do as well as from the increasinglevel of vertical integration with the sleep labs dispensing therapy.", "So our call pattern has not changed much over the last two years. Wecontinue to market our technology to the sleep labs, and our Adapt SV, and thesuccess we've had with that, kind of speaks to the presence that we've had inthe sleep labs. It remains high, will remain high.", "Mike Madsen - Wachovia", "Okay. That's all I've got. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO CapitalMarkets. Go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you for taking my question.", "Peter Farrell", "Hi, Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi. Can you give us a breakout between masks and flow generators in thequarter?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes, we can certainly attempt to do that. Give me two seconds here. Okay. Iwill give you a geographic mix which is 53%, in fact, that's almost identicalto the last few quarters. But 53% for the Americas,39% was Europe, and 8% was Asia Pac.", "In looking to flow generators, and masks and accessories, the flowgenerators were 14% increase. The masks and accessories were 13% increase, andthe overall was 14%. So they are pretty in line. But you asked for the split.", "And I think Joanne; you wanted the split between the sales. What percentagewas masks and accessories, right?", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And what percentage of them came from what markets?", "Keith Serzen", "So the Americas versus ROW, do you want me to give those, Peter?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes, why don't you do that Chris?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Kieran, here.", "Peter Farrell", "Yes.", "Keith Serzen", "Hasn't done this for about 15 years, but that's all right.", "Kieran Gallahue", "The Americas, let me just do the normal breakout, in the Americas flowgenerators were up 12%, masks and accessories were up 7%, for a total of 9%.", "Peter Farrell", "Bear in mind the total increase was 11% because that's messed up a littlebit by ResMed Motor Technologies, so the overall was bottom was 11% if we're\u2026", "Kieran Gallahue", "And if we back out RMT, the flow generators were 12% and masks andaccessories 11%.", "Peter Farrell", "12% and 11% is closer to the truth. The 7% reflects that impact of our lossof external business for RMT.", "Kieran Gallahue", "On the ROW side, flow generators were up 16%, masks and accessories were up25%, for a total of 19%, and then again that puts down to the 14% totalbusiness.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And if I did my math right, it looks like you had a lower tax ratethis quarter, in the 28% range. Can you comment on that and tell me what weshould be thinking about on a go-forward basis?", "Brett Sandercock", "Joanne, it is Brett. That's right. That tax rate for this quarter is alittle lower. In Germany they actually reduced their corporate tax rate byaround 10%, so we did have a one-off benefit around $700,000.", "And we restated some of our deferred tax balances over there, so if you backthat out, we're back to more like a 30.8% effective tax rate, and I think goingforward it should be sort of around that sort of level, certainly won'tcontinue at that low tax rate for Q1, but around sort of 30.8% mark.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, can you comment on where you think diagnosis is going tocome out?", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah. Again, there was a discussion, a panel yesterday, and I don't want togive any investment bank a free kick, but the consensus was that it willhappen. And if you ask me, I am saying it\u2019s about 75% sure.", "Why do I say that? First of all it\u2019s you have the rumor mill, which is neververy accurate. But second, when NCD\u2019s are looked at and normally when CMS makesa decision, they rarely reconsider it within a five-year period at least that'swhat we've been told. This is about two years and it would seem that there issome feeling within CMS that portal monitoring is a sensible way to go.", "Now, if you look at the prevalence of sleep disorder breathing versus, say,type-2 diabetes or asthma. And if you use that as kind of a model, you cannoteven imagine a circumstance, where every asthmatic patient for a Ventolin dosehad to go and see a pulmonologist or a respirologist, I mean the system wouldjust collapse.", "And the same is also true, if one looks at diabetes. I mean management ofdiabetes is really mostly primarily care physicians, internists, and so forth.The specialists see the acute exacerbations, so when the dam actually breaksand the sleep market starts to mature, people will be begging for portablemonitoring.", "And we see the growth potential beyond the current structure, where you havethe structure of DME\u2019s and HME\u2019s, they'll still be very important goingforward, but we see that that paradigm has to change really because it is justnot set up for scalability. And portal monitoring will become part of it and Iam pretty sure we're on the right tack there.", "When are these things going to happen? Obviously a favorable NCD ruling isgoing to be right in the sweet spot. The question is, how prescriptive orrestrictive will that be? And that I think is really where we're very, veryunsure.", "Now, clearly the AASM, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine whoopposed, very adamantly opposed portable monitoring. One might say there is alittle bit of conflict there because of lot of the members of the AASM actuallyown their own sleep labs.", "But my comment to that would be you're much better off fishing in the Pacific Ocean than Lake Ontario.In other words, you got these big nets you pull in all sorts of other sleepdisorder problems. It will be a different mix than what the labs are currentlyaddressing.", "There will be much more narcolepsy, cataplexy etcetera. And also complexsleep apnea, which is really the space where that ought to be treated in thesleep lab, so the easy low hanging fruit, if you like, will be taken care of Ithink outside the current structure.", "But look, that's just blue sky. I think, yes, it will be approved. I couldbe wrong, obviously. I don't know, but I would say it\u2019s a 75%. What would bethe concern is how restrictive is that and is CMS trying to keep everybody happyin which case, if it\u2019s very restrictive then, you know, it\u2019s not going toreally advance the field.", "Joanne Lynch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.", "Peter Farrell", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Then your next questions from the line of Joshua Zable of Natixis, go ahead.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.", "Peter Farrell", "Hi, Joshua.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Just wanted to get some more color on S8 II. I know I am surprised no oneelse asked this earlier. I know you went into a little detail about thetechnology.", "I am trying to understand.  The nameobviously of the S8 II would indicate that is in the same footprint as the S8but the name changed as opposed to one of those fancy names you usually giveit, maybe it's more than that, it\u2019s just not technology, I don't know. Can yougive me a little bit more color on it?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes. The naming is always one of these things, you know, why isn't it an S9and so on, but it is the same footprint, and I guess that's what reallydetermined in most people's minds, the consensus if you like, to call it an S8.But it is a really completely redesigned motor.", "I mean I was in Europe and Sweden for the European Respiratory Societymeeting towards the end of September, and we had the guys there had done somedemonstrations in Switzerland and Austria. And two sleep physicians, our salesguys, and the reports back were just incredibly encouraging.", "This is one quiet unit, but in addition to that, with the redesign of theinternal, in particular the motor, the breathing characteristics are justabsolutely stunning. You know, breathing in and out, there is virtually nochange at all in the pressure.", "In other words, some devices, you go back years ago, you get swings of 4 to 5 centimeters breathing in andbreathing out. It was just awful impedance. This thing is almost zeroimpedance. It is quiet as a mouse. I mean, you can believe your own dreams to acertain extent, but I talked to the Austrian and Swiss guys who did thedemonstration. And this is a great product.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "I guess what I am trying to understand is the way to think about it, sort ofas the highest end of the S8 family or is this going to be, even though it\u2019sthe same footprint. Is this going to replace the S8 and sort of the same waythe S8 took over for the S7, the S8 II in a similar footprint but now you getall the different features of the various S8 models but on a much quieter model?", "Peter Farrell", "Listen, Joshua, if you want to buy quite a few of the older versions, we canprobably help you out. Yes. The characteristics will flow through all of the S8family, and we think it is going to be, it is going to be really well receivedas I said, so yes, it is going to flow through all the family. And franklywe're excited about it.", "Kieran Gallahue", "And this is Kieran, just to add a little bit to Peter's comments, when yousay substantially the same, Josh, this is actually the same. So, from theoutside of the box, you're not going see a difference other than some of thelabeling. We're using the same box so that we can get scale opportunities onthat. So, you can use the same accessories.", "It is seamless from a customer perspective, but it\u2019s got a totally newengine in it. And the second thing to note is it hasn't been released yet, inthe U.S. or inthe Americas.It doesn't come until later in the fiscal year. So, we'll see that impact lateron. This product is absolutely incredible. The engine, as Peter was noting, isquiet. It is capable, and it allows an increase in functionality.", "Peter Farrell", "In fact, the breathing characteristics, just to follow on from Kieran'scomments there, are just so much better even though, the S8 is a great product,the breathing characteristics on this just kind of knock your socks off. It isa bit like getting a Porsche Turbo and putting a chip in it, and going from450-horsepower to 600-horsepower. This is really a swish unit.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Great, and then just on Saime, can we get anupdate? I know I usually ask this once a quarter.", "Peter Farrell", "We'll have to wait until Elisee comes. Thewrinkles are out of the VS Series, the Ultra, the Integra, etcetera, that iscoming off the blocks very nicely. We're happy with that. Still, some work todo on the 150, 250 and 350 Elisee. Every thing is moving in the rightdirection. Kieran, you might want to comment because you just were over withthe European leadership team, but it was the same was a good buy.", "We did get a few more surprises than we anticipated. We were locked in, aswe said in previous conference calls, to not expanding the customer base, andwe're getting ready now to go beyond that. Kieran, you might want to say a fewwords.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes, I think what you said is right on target. We're making very goodprogress on the quality side. We're moving a substantial portion, in fact allof it by the end of the year of the VS production down to our plant in Sydney,because the technology has stabilized to the point. And the quality levels haverisen to the point, where we have the ability to do that.", "So, it is a very encouraging sign from both quality and from the ability toincrease capacity. And quality levels of Elisee, particularly the Elisee 150have increased dramatically. So, the team is making very, very good progress onit. The business itself has grown in double-digits. So, we're quite pleasedwith it.", "Peter Farrell", "And just to add one more thing there, the 150 is obviously the main lineproduct. The 250\u2019s and 350\u2019s are more your hospital-based products, so the 150as a portable ventilator is where we want to be with a nice big screen, verycustomer friendly. If the thing works the way it is supposed to work.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Great.", "Peter Farrell", "That's the more important one.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Andrew Goodsall of UBS. You mayproceed.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Good morning, team. I just wanted to get an indication\u2026", "Peter Farrell", "Good meeting yesterday, Andrew.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Yes, great, glad you came along. We really appreciated it. Try to give me abit of information on what sort of contribution Adapt SV had made to thisresult.", "Peter Farrell", "Yes, we\u2019re seeing. We don't breakdown products into how is X, Y and Z going,but it is double-digit growth.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Okay. Great, thanks very much.", "Peter Farrell", "All right, Andrew.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Peter Farrell", "Excellent, thanks.", "Kieran Gallahue", "All right, so, why don't we wrap up the call? Peter, do you want to do thewrap-up?", "Peter Farrell", "I think we've probably exhausted everything, Kieran, unless you want to saygoodbye to everybody. I am happy to say goodbye.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sounds like a good idea.

My name is Akiya and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.

Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As noted, this is Kieran Gallahue, and I will be facilitating these calls on a go-forward basis. Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge our Founder and Executive Chairman, Peter Farrell who has led the organization from its inception and who has presided over these conference calls where he has announced record results for 15 consecutive quarters. That's an amazing result by any measure. And just to put that in perspective, in 1995, we had annual revenues of less than $25 million and today we are reporting revenues in excess of $200 million for a single quarter.", "I'd also like to remind our investors that Peter hasn't gone anywhere, he remains a very critical part of our strategy development process and of course he is a well-known luminary in the industry. I personally feel very fortunate to have worked with him in these past five years and I very much look forward to working side-by-side with him as we move forward. All right, let's get on to the call.", "So we are going to structure these calls a bit differently as we move forward. After this initial introduction, I am going to hand the ball off to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer and he is going to review results. At that point, I'll take the ball back and make a few comments putting the quarter into perspective and updating you on key developments and then I will open up the call for your questions.", "So with that, let me hand it off to Brett. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Great, thanks Kieran. So, I'll just run through the December quarter results briefly and start from the top. So, revenue for the December quarter was $202.7 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $10 million to our Q2 revenues. Our income from operations was $36.8 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $26.9 million. Our pro forma rate is $0.41 for the quarter. Now this measure excludes restructuring cost, stock-based comp expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. On a GAAP basis, our EPS is $0.34.", "In terms of overall currency impacts on our results this quarter, the weakening U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01. Gross margin for the quarter was 60%; this is broadly consistent with the September quarter. SG&A for the quarter came in at $67.6 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. If you look at that in constant currency terms, SG&A increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 33% this quarter compared to the year ago figure of 32%.", "R&D expense for the quarter was $14.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Again in constant currency terms, R&D expense was a more modest increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 7%, which is consistent with the year-ago figure. And looking a little forward with ongoing commitment to innovation, total product pipeline and clinical trial commitments, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continue in the 7% to 8% range through the balance of FY '08.", "Now amortization of acquired intangibles for the quarter was $1.9 million and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.3 million. For the balance of FY '08, we expect that quarterly stock-based comp expense to pick up to around $5.7 million in the third quarter. Now that reflects an up tick, as a result of annual stock option grant in November last year.", "Turning to revenues in more detail. Overall, the Americas sales were $100.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside of the Americas totaled $102.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter.", "Now our traditional break out of the revenues by product segments. In the Americas, flow generators were 2% lower than the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 12%, reflecting strong sales in our new product introduction. For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 16% over the prior year quarter reflecting momentum in our S8 II sales, while masks and other increased by 31%, again driven by strong new product sales. On a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 9%, while masks and other increased by 19%.", "Turning now to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations was $18.9 million for the quarter. However, excluding the impact of recall costs, cash flow for the quarter would have been $31.2 million. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21.9 million. This includes $14.2 million in building construction costs, predominantly associated with our San Diego headquarters. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $13.8 million.", "In terms of balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong. Total assets at December 31, were $1.3 billion, net equity was $1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents net of our external debt were $156 million at the end of December. I'd now like to hand the call back to Kieran for comments.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks Brett. All right. I'll make a few comments and what [inaudible] questions that are frequently asked and try to answer those in advance. And then I'll open the call up to more general Q&A.", "First you can see; we now had our 51st quarter of record results. And those results are in spite of the fact that we had anticipated both Q1 and Q2 of this year to be challenging due to difficult base year comps, GAAP period in our product introductions cycle and the response to earlier price challenges. I should also note that Q2 should be the last quarter where we expect our motor business to negatively impact our Americas growth rate. Q2 represented a few milestones and I'll be remissive if we pass by this call and I didn't note them. This was the first quarter in the company's history that we surpassed $200 million in revenue for a single quarter. And I am very pleased to report that both the Americas and ex-Americas market both contributed over $100 million each, that\u2019s a very nice balance of geographic revenues.", "All right. Let's transition to talk you about the future and let me say this as a header note. I feel extremely optimistic about this industry as we look forward and I feel just as optimistic about the role that ResMed can play within this industry. And let me tell you why I feel that way. I'm going to cover three basic topics although there're certainly many more that we can go through. I'll talk about our planned, product introductions schedule, a heart failure clinical study that we're initiating and finally the preliminary decision by CMS to allow home sleep testing.", "First our planned new product introduction schedule. In this quarter, we are launching and in fact in the past few days we've launched two important new products in the Americas. First, the VPAP Auto, which is a bilevel device. The second is the Mirage Micro nasal mask. All right, first on to the VPAP Auto, so what's different about it? First it's our first bilevel product we introduced into the more compact S8 body. It is far smaller than our previous generations bilevel. Second, it will use the same accessory sets such as our S8 humidifier as we use with the more general S8 product line. This helps to provide scale economies for ResMed, while eliminating non-value added changes for our customers reducing their inventory challenges. Third, it's powered by a unique patented double-ended motor, it's the same motor that powers our S8 II CPAPs that we are currently selling outside the Americas.", "This motor is a core component in our next round of product introduction, because it vastly increases the efficiency of the motor, allowing us to increase performance, while simultaneously reducing noise generated by the device. Because noise is an important factor in user comfort and compliance, we feel this is going to be a very highly valued future of our customers and in fact since it's in the S8 II device that's been launched ex-U.S. we've already being receiving very positive feedback about that.", "The fourth value proposition for the VPAP Auto is the integration of our unique Easy-Breathe waveform and you will be hearing a lot more about the Easy-Breathe waveform in the coming months. The Easy-Breathe waveform is an extremely comfortable flow pattern that once again improves user comfort and as we know that's a major factor in driving compliance. So, we are very optimistic about the launch of the VPAP Auto, given the timing of the release we should see some of the impact in Q3 although it's going to be a partial impact in this quarter and more full impact in Q4.", "Second product we\u2019ve introduced within the past few days is the Mirage Micro Mask, and this is our first product introduction into the standard nasal mask category in four years. Just as the quadro set of new standard for a full-face mask performance, we believe the Mirage Micro will set a new standard for comfort, ease of fitting and performance within the standard nasal mask category.", "As we look to Q4, we should have a full quarter of impact both from the Mirage Micro and the VPAP Auto and then we are going to introduce another series of products during the fourth quarter. Let me go through those for just a minute. On the CPAP side, we will be introducing several of the S8 II product series in to market, in the Americas that we've already launched during Q2 in Europe or outside the Americas. Once again, the products will be powered by our unique double-ended motor technology that has allowed us to improve performance and at the same time lowering noise levels. Just like the VPAP Auto, we will retain the current S8 design and accessories in order to minimize transition challenges for our customers while maintaining our on supply chain scale efficiencies.", "Finally, we expect to be introducing of new mask product into the nasal pillows category also during Q4 and we will provide more detail on that product as the product launches. So as you can see, we've got a fantastic new product flow over next five months or so and it is a... it is a product line that is built up with innovative technologies, but is also consistent with our strategy of maintaining efficiencies with the customer in our own supply chain.", "All right, next I would like to address the industry drivers and first, let's talk about congestive heart failure. In January this year, we have begun the recruitment of our first patients into the predominantly European-based clinical study in heart failure. We've long noted the critical role of the treatment of SDB can have on very serious and very costly co-morbidities such as congestive heart failure, such as diabetes, hypertension and others. This study represents a very tangible stake in the ground of our commitment to both providing and generating value from the these co-morbidities. This study, which is intended to be conducted over a five or so year time frame is targeted to the use of adaptive servo-ventilation and very specifically to the use of the ResMed ACS2 product in severe heart failure patients.", "The primary end points measured by the end points, which are meaningful to the heart failure and to the payer communities, mortality and hospitalizations. The study will engage two primary critical medical specialties, cardiologists and respirologists or pulmonologists. Heart failure costs government billions of dollars per annum to treat and we're optimistic that the use of ResMed's adaptive servo-ventilation, very specifically the ACS2 products will provide clinical benefits but positive economic benefits. While we don't intend to report specifically on the study as it progresses, we'll provide updates as material information or results become available.", "Finally, let me briefly comment on the preliminary national coverage decision that CMS in December. First of all let me highlight that this decision is preliminary and a final decision is due out in mid March of this year. Now, our reading in the preliminary decision is that CMS has recognized that SVD is an enormous public health issue and they're seeking to increase the access to diagnose this in treatment of the 90% of the patients who have not yet been diagnosed or treated.", "We also see the decision as an indication that home testing will be complimentary to the current diagnostic pathway and we're hopeful and confident that our valued partners in the sleep community will continue to play a pivotal role in treating patients and we plan to support our partners as they evolve and thrive in this new environment. From the perspective of impact on the SVD device community, this represents an additional driver for growth over the long haul, and one more reason for us to believe that the industry continues to have bright prospects.", "We remain in an industry that is 90% unpenetrated and achieving sustainable industry growth in the 15% to 20% range is supported by these types of drivers. Now, importantly, there's some water to flow under the bridge before this decision is finalized, and before we feel its full impact in the industry. In general, medical community takes a bit of time to absorb change and it wouldn't be surprising to us if it is 18 months to 24 months to pass before this thing sorts itself out. Nonetheless, it remains a very positive change for the industry and one that we look forward to supporting.", "So in summary, we're very optimistic about the future of the industry and the role that ResMed can play in our industry's growth and we're looking forward to the positive forward momentum that we'll see not only from our new product introductions that we'll be seeing over the next five months, but also these positive developments in the industry as a whole. All right, with that why don't I take a break and turn it over to Q&A. Akiya?", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable of Natixis. Please proceed.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call here. Peter, I take this opportunity to thank you for all your help over the years and Kieran I guess you obviously been around for a while, but a formal welcome to the party here. Just obviously kind of the main... probably the big question that sticks out is the flow generators in the Americas. Can you just comment, I mean everything else looks great. Maybe that's a function in the motor business. Just if you can give us a little commentary on that.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, I'll let Keith to handle part of it, let me just open it up. We're basically a gap period here. We've had some very difficult base year comparables that we are dealing with and it sort of peaks out in Q2, we have got the new product introductions that will be in the flow generator side, that will be coming forth, not only the VPAP Auto here in Q3, but also we are going to see in Q4 and quite frankly there is also a bit of pricing impact that was in those numbers as well. So little bit lower than we are used to, that's for sure. But again, we've got confidence as we move forward that will be flowing out of that. Keith, you got anything to add to that?", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Kieran I think that that is a pretty adequate job of going through the explanation, the only... but the only thing that I would add is that we\u2019ve also had some growth in our sales force over the course of the last year or so and as a result of that growth, we've had some promotions within the sales force, we've expanded some territories and added some new territories. Well, one of the things that we found is that it takes our reps about six months to really begin to ramp up to a level of productivity once they come on board, and fortunately we are at the point where those reps, those new reps that we've added are now clearing that six month productivity and moving towards nine months.", "So with the refreshing of the product line which gives us an opportunity to really get the sales force excited about what they are selling and the combination of the reps becoming more mature in what they are doing, I think that that's something we look forward to.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. And then just a follow-up, can you guys just talk about the sort of overall health of the market here. I know you sort of alluded to it but obviously just obviously with you and Respironics out there and I guess as it relates to may be home diagnostics, are we expecting sort of some change here with people kind of ready, maybe holding back as things get, and then obviously expect a pick up when it sort of goes full swing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. So... I think periods of changes there is always short-term opportunity for people to sort of look and question what their role is, but the general signals in the market is positive one at this point. I think that the home\u2026 the preliminary decision on home testing certainly is one that bodes extremely well for the long-term access of the patients for the diagnostics process and removes some of the bricks and mortars limitations that may have been governor on growth as we've seen in the past. So near term, there is certainly going to be some jockeying for position out there, as various members of the medical community determine what the role is that they are going to play in this new world going forward. But I suspect that we'll yield some more positive contribution versus negative side. I think the changes are good.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. Well thanks a lot. Great job guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills of Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Thank you and how are you. Wanted to follow-up Kieran if I can on the last question or the last answer about some of the constituents within the supply chain here are jockeying for positions, I'm trying to figure out how they could fit in. Could you elaborate on that a bit further, specifically it seems that we are seeing growth in the number of beds which is an underlying variable that is important for growth in the underlying market. However may be not as robust as you've seen in years past and perhaps that is because folks in the supply chain are trying to figure out what is going... what the markets or what the environment is going to look like after the final decision. Could you help us understand what you see in terms of growth in the number of sleep labs currently and how you think that will change as folks sort of figure out how... where they fit in?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So part of this is... information we have directed sort of detail or data, and part of it's going to be more just looking at the market and we are providing--.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Sure.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But, we're seeing continued growth on the sleep lab PSG, capacity side but let's face it, if we are looking for the real growth in the capacity that's going to be this home testing as it comes through, because then it moves well beyond the bricks and mortars and we're all going to have a look at a different indicators of growth as we move forward. And as far as I'm concerned that\u2019s a very positive thing, right because it demonstrates that there is going to be more ways of growing capacity. It's good to see that sleep labs continue to expand some of their capacity because we feel [inaudible] important role within\u2026 in this\u2026 in the diagnostic process. There were to be a certain amount of the patients that will be able to be fully tested and diagnosed with home testing and there will be a certain amount of those patients which are going to need more comprehensive care, such as those, let's say in complex sleep apnea that are going to need the help and support of that in the lab diagnostic process. So we are pleased to see that they'll continue to do that. So in general... again I guess I can only say that there are various players who have spoke up that are waiting for the final decision, but are looking to get in the gap to actively engage.", "There is some members in the sleep community, they feel they can play a very important role as part of the hub-and-spoke model of engaging other specialists and primary care physicians. You\u2019ve heard public statements from home medical equipment providers, who feel that they can provide a role in helping to accelerate the diagnostics rate by getting engaged in home testing. I suspect that there will be other players that will get involved in that as well. So from our view is we try to borrow [ph] that down and say what does that mean from an industry perspective, and I got it clear everything that we are seeing in that is extremely positive, it means that there is going to be more awareness building that there will be more interested parties in various stages of the market that will be looking to try to take those 90% of the patients who remain undiagnosed, and try to find a complimentary path way to help them reach therapy.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Great, that's very helpful, just two quick follow-ups here, I don\u2019t if they are quick, but I'll try to make them quick. So I understand how that would impact positively perhaps longer term, near term\u2026 perhaps some of an impact that we won't see the final decision until March. So from what you've laid out we have this environment for you, we have new products and easier year-over-year comparisons and perhaps still some jockeying for physician as a modest option. So, with that said as we look into the near term to the second half of your fiscal year, could you helps a little bit with respect to your expectations for the growth, especially in our U.S. business but also the ability to maintain the growth you put up this quarter in the international business given what's lying in front of you for the next couple of quarters?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So obviously the\u2026 anything to do with the home testing, actually one point of clarification before I start, when I say the jockeying for position I mean that's our positive side, I don't know that's an offset at this point so.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But if we go to the next stage, obviously in the international side they are not going to be influence or impacted by the home testing, really what\u2019s driving that is positive introduction of the SA-2 it's been a very well received product into that market, as well as some of the new mass products, as well as quite frankly execution. We have been improving in many areas of the world, we\u2019ve been improving our execution, so I feel very good about that piece, obviously the piece that\u2019s influence by currency is lot [ph]. But, as far as the execution the basic fundamentals of the business I feel very good about the way that the team is performing and the basic stable of products that we have. On the America side as we move forward we've been stating here for quite a number of quarters is that, we felt that Q1 and Q2 were going to be difficult because of the product gaps and some of the base year comps and sort of absorbing some of the pricing channels. And then as we move through Q3 and Q4, we are beginning to get into that product flow in Q3 and a bit more product flow in Q4, and we have proved... we expect that we will begin climbing back during that period back to market rates of growth. So, we continue to feel comfortable with that assessment.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Great. And then last question, I will get back in queue, regarding gross margins. I mean, just sort of in plain speak here, have we seen the trough in gross margins? I think 60% was kind of a line that most of us wanted to see sort of stabilize that and can we see expansion from here giving clearly a lot of what you have talked about with respect to the new product suggest efficiencies are being worked into the manufacturing facilities, and I guess it speaks to how can that sort of be a greater influence to your gross margins relative to the price pressure you have seen in with respective ladder. Do we expect to see that abate a bit as Respironics becomes part of a larger organization that probably is more interested in sales\u2026 interested in running a profitable business.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think you have got a short-term element to that question, you have longer-term element of that question, and would I be looking for margin expansion in the next few quarters? No, I think that will be difficult to look for. One of the very comforting things of this market is that many of the pricing pressures that we talked about six months ago, nine months ago, it seems that there has been a floor established in the market. We are not seeing price levels drop below where we had seen some of the deals, six and nine months ago. On the flip side of that, you do have obviously more customers as we have said it is going to happen here, more customers who are getting this price level. So what you are going to see externally during that time period is a bit continued pressure on ASPs here over the next few quarters, but again the good news is we are not seeing... it is simply an expansion to more customers. That's a very classic way of what happens in price in this market.", "So, a lot of the gross margin improvements that... and some of the fundamental drivers that we would see really come with significant changes in the product evolution, and that we would see in sort of next generations of product and some of the changes that we are working on behind the seasons in the supply chain. So near-term, would I be looking for expansion? No. Are we fundamentally doing the right things to continue to reduce our cost of goods over the longer haul, absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wachovia. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "Sure. I guess, just wanted to ask you again a little bit about your confidence level in a rebound, I mean the comps obviously do get easier, but the growth in the US does seem to have slowed pretty substantially and the numbers that are out there show, I mean the consensus estimate shows a fair bit of acceleration in the next couple of quarters. Are you comfortable with those?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I don't comment on any specific sort of numbers that are out there, but let me talk a little bit more in general, Michael. So, again these first couple of quarters, we did have very difficult base year comps, and we in a gap in the product flow etc. As we move into the Q3 and Q4, again we are climbing back towards market levels of growth. So, do I feel comfortable with that? Yes, I do feel comfortable that we can climb back towards those levels. I am not here saying that we are going to get back to where we were a year and half ago at 45% and 50% growth levels. I don't think that would be reasonable to assume, but I do think that we have some very good positive momentum to get back to market levels to grow.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "Okay and then, I was wondering if your growth... are you going to do anything to try to rein in the SG&A and R&D levels, given further growth in those expenditures, given the slowing revenue growth that we are seeing, because they... they were growing a little faster, I think in your overall revenue growth in the quarter, I realized some of that might have due to currency?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, big part of it was due to currency, I think Brett had given the breakout on\u2026 for instance on R&D and the growth in constant currency and we're substantially lower. At this point, feel very comfortable particularly in R&D line with the amount of investment that we are providing into the business and, when you are in a market that\u2019s 90% untapped, our view is this is not the time to take your foot of the accelerator. So we are doing the smart things I think in the sense that as the currency is going a bit against us, we have slowed constant currency growth of those, but we are going to starve the business. We simply\u2026 this is simply the wrong phase of this industry's growth. And particularly, when you look at all the good things that are happening whether it is the\u2026 the home testing decision that we are looking forward to in March, already we talk about some of the data that's coming out in the co-morbidity, be it congestive heart failure, the study I think is going to be very important over the long haul both the payers as well as to the clinical community, and in areas such as diabetes and occupational health there are so many aspects in this market that are untapped, that our job is to keep this market growing and to participate more than our fair share in that growth and so, I think now is the wrong time for us to look at any substantial leverage of that.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "All right, and then I guess just two product related questions on some of your recently introduced products, I guess not that recent, but the Adapt SV and then the Tango kind of at the low and high end of the markets, just any updates you can gives us there on the progress with those products?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes both are playing their role, the Adapt SV remains, and remember the Adapt SV is also known as the ACS 2 in Europe, so it remains a core element of our strategic growth as we move forward and it is the basis of this congestive heart failure study. So we continue to gain traction in the understanding awareness of complex sleep apnea and we continue to focus on the significant role that a complaint [ph] congestive heart failure outside the U.S. As far as the Tango, I remember is really two different parts to the strategy behind Tango, on one side it was basically to pick up some great, it was\u2026 we haven't traditionally participated in that very low-end part of the market. And the idea was when you are on a sales call and they are buying those low end, let's participate, we are doing okay in that area, that is not really our core skill set, we tend to sell higher technology, we tend to sell algorithms that make a difference and focus on other aspects of the sales process.", "So I'll say that we are doing all right, we are certainly not hitting out of the park with the part of it. The other part of the Tango of course was more of a, sort of strategic blocking strategy overtime. And not for any particular competitor or any particular risk on the horizon, but we got a nice market here and one other things that we look to do is to create barriers to entry over time, and if you look at the most rational place that a competitor might try to enter the market it would be where the intellectual property barriers and the technology barriers low switches, the low end CPAP and it has done an effective job I think in that side of the market, which is to create a bit of block.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "All rights that's all I've got thanks.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great for asking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Lee of Caris & Company. Please proceed.", "Timothy Lee - Caris & Company", "Hi. Good afternoon. Kieran, can you just give us your thoughts on how do you think the market dynamics may change here with Respironics in the hands of the Philips, I mean do you think we are ahead into a era of greater pricing stability and\u2026 Keith it will get as well I guess given his experience with Philips as a part of heart chain [ph]?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. That will be great. So in... obviously the waters got to flow under the bridge here. So, we're sitting here trying to predict the future. But, I can tell you that my view on the acquisitions is I'm very positive on it, I think it's great. And I think in a lot of ways it's great validation of the growth prospects in this industry, I think it's recognition of this industry being highly under penetrated and I think, having a large well known brand entering the marketplace should help us in creating awareness within the industry and creating awareness within the various medical cilo [ph]. So, I'm very positive and very optimistic about the future and Philips\u2019 entry into the marketplace.", "As far as pricing, we will have to see how that flows. I encouraged to note the reputation of their company is usually to sell on value on a market expansion and value being bringing new and innovative ideas to the marketplace. That's the kind of market that we think is appropriate, again for such an under penetrated market. So my view is that it's a positive development and I am looking forward to working with them in market expansion and obviously competing with them in the appropriate manner. Keith, you have anything to add to that?", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Kieran, I would just say that I agree with you 100% on the perspective that Philips sells on the basis of value, they also have a history of growing markets, which is one of the things that lot of us are very excited about. We... ResMed has spent a lot of time growing individual market segments. Respironics has spent a lot time as a close follower. We view Philips as a company that will invest in the market growth and put as much time into the development driving, more people into the diagnostic channel and the therapeutic channel as we are. So, we are very excited about this.", "Timothy Lee - Caris & Company", "One last if I may just, can you give us your current thoughts on how you think competitive bidding is going to play out in the marketplace?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Again, water is got to flow under the bridge there. We will wait to see what the... how the results pan out there and you know what bids are accepted and what not. We hear mixed things from the marketplace. As with anything before the final pronouncements, you get plenty of rumors running around. And the good thing here is that, you know, CMS was running a bit higher on the pricing than you'll see at most managed care and other payers, so there's room to move on that to start with. And from our perspective, it's 10% of our global sales 20% of our U.S. sales and so we think we are still well positioned to compete there. But, it's not a direct impact on us, it's an indirect impact.", "Timothy Lee - Caris & Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair please proceed.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Good afternoon Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Just few things I wanted to follow-up on. First, if you look at the U.S. generator growth versus the international and you normalize for currency, what's your sense about how important the driver the new generators have been on the constant currency generator growth overseas and should we see that really kicking in quickly here in the third fiscal quarter with the new product?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes great question. So you know the... a large part of the S8 II impact has not even really been felt in the ex-U.S. market. It was launched during the quarter and so you have the product introduction time and depending on what market you are in, you either see a delayed impact or you see it more similar to what you see in the Americas. France would be an example of where you see it more quickly. Germany would be an example of where there's a multi-month delayed impact on that. So, what I can speak to is all leading indicators and the signals and the feedback we've had from market and I got to tell that people are responding very well.", "And the thing that they seem to be keen on is the difference in this motor technology. I... they are getting the concept, that is like changing the engine in your car and it is very different, I mean it is much more efficient the... motor spins at a slower rate and yet it gives higher performance and that all leads to a major issue in this market place which is how do you reduce noise, and so it provides wins in each of those segments. So, all the indicators that we had out of the ex-US market place today have been extremely positive. And I think it will have a very positive impact on our ability to sell in the Americans, to be able to not inconvenience our customers by making them change their accessories and what not, and yet giving them a whole new engine to the car. So, its ... I think the signals [ph] are good.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "So, if you look at the US generator growth and what is really going on here, you were down 7%, what's mix? I mean, what is price and then what's units? Are units down, you know, units flat and prices down $10.15 [ph], what's going on?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think when we are down, we are down about 2% in the flow generator right?", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Excuse me, I am sorry, I was thinking on the plus 7 on the total, so minus two, but what is going on there?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right, so it is a little bit of both. Clearly you had some, some price in that, but for the most part I still have to say that flow generator on a volume basis is flat, so it may not have gone backwards, but it's flat. And part of that is the various elements that I noted earlier, I mean part of that to difficult base... part of that is the product gap. We were sort of in anticipation of these changes to the S8, where we can introduce some new feature sets and introduce some new value props, and some of that is, some of the are points that the Keith has noted, but--.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But I don\u2019t know, Keith do you have anything to add to that?", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "I would just say that, when you look at the S81, it is a product platform that is 10 or 11 quarters old and our competitor has had a ref... a new product introduction during that period of time, the momentum swung in their direction, the S82 with the new motor and the, and the noise factor and the easy breath capability is something around our organization is looking for very strongly to bring significant life into what we were doing. It is\u2026 for intends and purposes we will view it as a new product introduction and we are very exited about it, it depend and will swing back.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, and so then just kind of finishing up on the generator side..", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "But then, let me interrupt you for a second, because I don\u2019t think Kieran caught this in his response back to you, you asked specifically about Q3, that product will be introduced into the US at the beginning of Q4.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "All right, yes you got that\u2026 but you got the S8 platforms for the VPAP and there is\u2026 it may help a little bit I guess.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Exactly.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, so if you think...", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Partial quarter impact.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Sure. So if you think about though the impact of the Adapt SV, I mean this a very high dollar price system. What sort of impact is that having? Is that $5 million product a quarter at this point and is that keeping the core generator business from being down 5 or 10 on a unit basis, or is this all generally flattish?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "W haven't broken out that, that piece in the past and so I\u2026 I don\u2019t feel comfortable at this point going below that on sort of the mix analysis, but in general I think it's fair to say that, that when you look at the materiality of the impact, the flow generators is flat to down a little bit, and I think that\u2019s\u2026 it is a fair assessment and a conclusion to walk away with them.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, and just one quick question for Brett if you are still around. The tax rate in the quarter, can you kind of walk me through what's going on there and what we should expect for the balance of the year please?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, hi Ben. So, the tax rate for this quarter was 30.9% the effective tax rate, which is pretty similar to Q1. I expect the balance of FY '08, it will be around that level as well.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay. So no changes there and then finally on CapEx, you obviously see the impacts of the facility build out in San Diego. What's your thought on that and how long that's going to run at kind of a higher level, and is there any additional CapEx for facilities expected beyond that new facility?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "No, so we're pretty much through, we had some extension for the manufacturing facility down here in Sydney, which was completed in December, so that's pretty much through there. So, now we've got the county Mysore [ph] facility that\u2019s been constructed, it is due to finish around March 2009, and roughly [inaudible] a quarter on CapEx for that facility.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, Brett may be some housekeeping questions with respect to currency, can you, first give us what your FX assumptions are for the, in terms of the total impact for the rest of this year?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "If I could tell you what the currency is going to do, I could probably do that but I think, I mean you just don't know where we're going to go with currency particularly at the moment where it's pretty volatile. But clearly we have some hedging in place, which mitigates to some extent. I think, and I am looking at... I don't think we're going to get a perishable movements out of next year for a while in the Euro or the all the end.", "When you look at how various analyst predictions, some are up and some are down. So I think we just continue to manage as we've done and in terms of the impact though if you're looking at, there was one thing this quarter what might be in the next few quarters. Suppose if the currencies wash through you probably looking at the sort of impact over the next few quarters, barring any major movements in the currency.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great very good. So then in terms of, as we think of margins impact over the quarter here, we should think of the gross margin perhaps being relatively flat with the room for potential little bit of improvement [inaudible] is that the correct way of thinking about it?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I mean, not too much more add that Kieran said at the moment it is around 60% in the short term we likely get any expansion on that, probably not. But if you look at September to December that margin was around the sort of 60% mark with the whole various factors, obviously some mix in our performance in March generally speaking would mean that you'd get some benefit on the margin.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Pretty good and then one question, I'll put it either Kieran or Keith, in terms of the S8 recall, can give us some update please on what you stand on that in terms of completion and remediating it and how long do you expect will take complete please.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll throw that to Keith.", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "So we believe that\u2026 well first of all there is two different ways to break that down one is the world\u2026 the ROW recall which I think that this point is pretty well on it, pretty much on suite to total completion. In the U.S. we believe that we are about 70% completed with this, we believe that we are at the point where there is no further distraction to the sales force or very minimal going forward. But we also believe that they will be in this for another probably one to two quarters, which is what we had anticipated when the first announced the recall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith of JPMorgan, please proceed.", "Alex Smith - JPMorgan", "Hi, guys. Just a question on the heart failure trails. How much is that going to cost in terms of financing and can you give us some... are going to be trying for that or someone else.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, we will be funding it, and Brett you want to go through the estimates?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So it will be... looking at the study it will be ... it's around 4 years to 5 years 4.5 years with the total cost of between $10 million and $12 million over that period of time. Spread reasonably evenly, but you might get little bit of a kick up in FY \u201809 on that study. But in terms of the total funding it's around that $10 million to $12 million over that period. To the extent, we will have quickly that... we go through that spending depends on how quickly you recruit through the clinical trial and so on. But in terms of overall ballpark figures that's what we're talking about.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, let me just...", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "In fact in addition to the 7% or so as you spend on R&D or part of that on going commitment?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "That will be part of the on going commitment we think we'll run around the 7% to 8% including funding that trial.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And I guess another question is obviously with that home testing the roll of auto setting devices becomes a bit more important in terms of setting the pressures in the home. Kieran, do you think that we could see a mix shift towards IPAPs as the CMS ruling does come through pretty much as the proposal?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think, again I think we have to wait for\u2026 see how the proposals pull through the finish line here. But certainly you would think it would open the opportunity for the additional use of auto setting technologies. There is the whole question of how the titration event occurs at home if the diagnostic process happens at home. One of the great benefits of auto setting technology is that it adjusts night-by-night, day-by-day over the entire time period of the individual user. So, it is absolutely perfectly tailored to those types of opportunities and I should note that, we did not waste any time... as soon as preliminary decision came out within a couples of weeks we were back as we have before. We're trying to take advantage to see if we can get increased compensation, and increased reimbursement for our customer to be able to supply those auto-setting devices.", "So it is long shot, I wouldn\u2019t necessary model in success at this point, but I think it that\u2026 there was a very good economic rationale for the increased use of auto setting, it's going to simplify the process, it's going to improve patient care, it's going to reduce the expense of the HMEs in handling these patients. But I think they need be to appropriate compensated. So we're going to drive on that. Just one more on, by the way on the congestive heart side, I don't pass by that question without noting. This is a very significant event for us, I think in putting a stake in the ground of congestive heart failure. We've talked quite a bit about the co-morbidities and we've taken some significant actions over time. But, this is a very interesting pivotal study that should help demonstrate benefits in both mortality and hospitalization and that's an important aspect in the health economics and the continued reimbursement in this area. So, it's a very important role and leadership role that we're taking in this market.", "And in addition, there is a side benefit, what you're doing there, is you're the increasing the awareness and the understanding of the role that adaptive servo-ventilation plays within the heart failure community and we look forward to generating benefit during the life of that study. So, it's a very important study from multiple aspects.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Kieran you mentioned that you've basically applying to get a new for an IPAP, how long do you think that process might take?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Why don\u2019t I throw that over to David Pendarvis who leads many of our efforts in that area.", "David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General Counsel", "As you know, we\u2019ve gone through this code this the past and haven't received it. So as Kieran said, we don't want everybody immediately model in, increase reimbursement for our automatic device, but that would come up during the first half of calendar '08 and again that's at the CMS level. So, as with all of these things both home testing and any increased reimbursement, that impacts the U.S. Medicare reimbursement first and anything that would happen positively would take a while to roll through the commercial payers throughout the rest of the US. So, we look forward if we got something positive, we would hope to see it answer in the first half of the year.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks very much guys.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you for taking the question. You told us that FX was a negative penny contributor to EPS. What was the impact of the top line?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Joanne it is Brett. Yes, on the top line, we had favorable currency movements at around $10 million to the revenue number.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. How many patients are you going to be having in your congestive heart failure trial?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The objective is 1200 patients. So, it's quite a sizable study, particularly for this industry it's certainly the largest study of its nature.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "And on previous conference you have talked about the OSI market growing 15% to 20% and your goal or wasn't a goal because I know guys don\u2019t give guidance. But would be around getting to sort of within that range for '08. What are you currently thinking?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, we historically said that we believe the ex-US market growth is about 10% to 15% per annum and that the Americas market, where we expect to grow at 15% to 20% per annum as an average basis. And so, when you blend those things together, you're somewhere around that 15% plus range. So, we continue to feel comfortable that in the long range that that's the growth prospects of the industry, certainly there will be sometimes when it is a little bit above and little bit below that and we've seen that over the past x number of years. And I'll just say again, I'm just extremely comfortable and pleased with some of the signals for the long-term health and growth in this marketplace, particularly with the home testing.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. But am trying to get the arms around... a couple of other people are trying to do... It sounds like if...are we at a trough, do you move out of it and what is your pace of moving out of it? I know comps getting easier, I know you've got new products, I know you don't like to give guidance. Can you just start to put some gate on some numbers though?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Well, Again I think we'll continue to try to give you the directional piece of it we been giving. Do we think we've troughed [ph] in the America side of this, yes I think we have, and we expect to be pulling out of that. As we go through Q3 and Q4, we've got a partial impact to some new products in Q3, we've got some partial impact of other new products in Q4 and some of that get the full balance. So, our objective is to start to get back towards market rates of growth as we get towards the end of this fiscal year and then take it for there into the next year. So, to answer you directly do we feel like we've troughed in the Americas, yes that's certainly our expectation.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall of UBS. Please proceed.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Thanks very much Kieran. And congratulations in taking out the roll there. Just, I guess just thinking, I guess did node the head with home diagnosis, obviously a potential power driver for the industry. We are sort of hearing, I guess some mechanizing of home healthcare dealers and so on putting plants in place. Could you give us some indication of sort of what steps you might be taking over the sort of next 6 to 12 months and whether there is any cost involved. Just to I guess align yourself to sort of take advantage?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so I think that will become more and more clear as we get to a final decision and we understand what's in and what's out, right in there is...", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Yes.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Slight variables in this decision. Type 3, Type 4 devices who are... is going to be able to be involved in the process with the titration penetration process that is going to be acceptable how that going to be reimbursed. So there is some pieces in here that can influence the role that we can play and who will be addressing that. So at this point, I don't anticipate that we have certainly any increased expenditures to support that, and if an opportunity arises and we think that we can see a way of stimulating growth extremely quickly, would we jump on it, you bet. Is that immediately obvious at this point? No its not, I think at this point we and others have... already have technologies, so we've got the ApneaLink which is a very unique device and very powerful device that will certainly satisfy the requirements for the Type 4. There are others that have that and there is a number of suppliers in Type 3, which is good, because that indicates that there is number of players that from an industry perspective can supply devices that can get these devices in the hands to those who need to use them and our intention is to work with our partners that we work with through for quite sometimes support sweet communities as they evolve through this process and most importantly to support the patient outcomes, how can we help them drive to access for more patients. So at this point, again the short answer to your question, we are looking for some significant expenditures in support of this, I don't see that at this point.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "It sounds like next quarter question bit more details with the decision but, perhaps a quick follow on just actually Germany had been weak in previous quarters obviously could read down rest of all with currency. Could you perhaps just sort of outline were Germany is out at the moment, maybe any [inaudible]?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, yes so Germany as a results perspective continues to be relatively flat, that being said I think we are making very significant progress in a lot of aspects of the German organization in the German market. The new management team has been there for about a year, they took a bit of timing, see underneath them and they have made some very positive changes. The thing to remember is that the German marketplace we're home medical equipment provider and so when we make changes there is this process\u2026 for instance with the S8 II, you put the S8 II out there, you need to get out last, then there is a, often a three-month period were you have introduction not only to the physicians but then there is trial periods for the patients. Then there prescription is written and then we have to chase down the payment on that prescription over another 90 days.", "So as a result, when you start seeing some positive indicators, you start seeing the flow through a little bit later and then in addition to that course you have deferred revenue etcetera, I mean the service contracts. So Germany, we tend to look for the sort of positive signals of improvement such as in prescription rates or other aspects of the market and we've started to see that. So I'm comfortable that Germany is beginning the slow road back to recovery and it seems in good shape. What that does indicate is that other parts of ex-Americas are doing quite well, we've got A-Pac [ph] that\u2019s doing quite well. We have other countries within Europe, such as France and the UK that are really hitting the ball out of the park and that's both because of the product stream and because of a fundamental execution. So, it's a mix bag and... but the mixed bag is for the most part... Germany still serving that flat range, but signals of improvement, but other than that very, very good progress.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And that is all the questions we have for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran Gallahue. Please proceed.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. I appreciate the interest and then the questions. As you can see we did have some challenges in Q2 and particularly some challenges in Americas, but I would like to leave the call with a highlight that I am feeling very optimistic about where this market can head in long term. We have some very good short-term signals, and if you look at our product flow over the coming five to six months we are very encouraged by what it's going to mean to the organization and what it's going to mean to the sleep community [ph]. So I look forward to updating you on future calls and demonstrating our progress. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Akiya and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]", "Before we begin, the company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as the forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Akiya. As noted, this is Kieran Gallahue, and I will be facilitating these calls on a go-forward basis. Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge our Founder and Executive Chairman, Peter Farrell who has led the organization from its inception and who has presided over these conference calls where he has announced record results for 15 consecutive quarters. That's an amazing result by any measure. And just to put that in perspective, in 1995, we had annual revenues of less than $25 million and today we are reporting revenues in excess of $200 million for a single quarter.", "I'd also like to remind our investors that Peter hasn't gone anywhere, he remains a very critical part of our strategy development process and of course he is a well-known luminary in the industry. I personally feel very fortunate to have worked with him in these past five years and I very much look forward to working side-by-side with him as we move forward. All right, let's get on to the call.", "So we are going to structure these calls a bit differently as we move forward. After this initial introduction, I am going to hand the ball off to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer and he is going to review results. At that point, I'll take the ball back and make a few comments putting the quarter into perspective and updating you on key developments and then I will open up the call for your questions.", "So with that, let me hand it off to Brett. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Great, thanks Kieran. So, I'll just run through the December quarter results briefly and start from the top. So, revenue for the December quarter was $202.7 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $10 million to our Q2 revenues. Our income from operations was $36.8 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $26.9 million. Our pro forma rate is $0.41 for the quarter. Now this measure excludes restructuring cost, stock-based comp expense and amortization of acquired intangibles. On a GAAP basis, our EPS is $0.34.", "In terms of overall currency impacts on our results this quarter, the weakening U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our EPS of approximately $0.01. Gross margin for the quarter was 60%; this is broadly consistent with the September quarter. SG&A for the quarter came in at $67.6 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. If you look at that in constant currency terms, SG&A increased by 10% over the prior year quarter. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 33% this quarter compared to the year ago figure of 32%.", "R&D expense for the quarter was $14.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Again in constant currency terms, R&D expense was a more modest increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 7%, which is consistent with the year-ago figure. And looking a little forward with ongoing commitment to innovation, total product pipeline and clinical trial commitments, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continue in the 7% to 8% range through the balance of FY '08.", "Now amortization of acquired intangibles for the quarter was $1.9 million and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.3 million. For the balance of FY '08, we expect that quarterly stock-based comp expense to pick up to around $5.7 million in the third quarter. Now that reflects an up tick, as a result of annual stock option grant in November last year.", "Turning to revenues in more detail. Overall, the Americas sales were $100.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside of the Americas totaled $102.5 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter.", "Now our traditional break out of the revenues by product segments. In the Americas, flow generators were 2% lower than the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 12%, reflecting strong sales in our new product introduction. For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 16% over the prior year quarter reflecting momentum in our S8 II sales, while masks and other increased by 31%, again driven by strong new product sales. On a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 9%, while masks and other increased by 19%.", "Turning now to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations was $18.9 million for the quarter. However, excluding the impact of recall costs, cash flow for the quarter would have been $31.2 million. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $21.9 million. This includes $14.2 million in building construction costs, predominantly associated with our San Diego headquarters. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $13.8 million.", "In terms of balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong. Total assets at December 31, were $1.3 billion, net equity was $1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents net of our external debt were $156 million at the end of December. I'd now like to hand the call back to Kieran for comments.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks Brett. All right. I'll make a few comments and what [inaudible] questions that are frequently asked and try to answer those in advance. And then I'll open the call up to more general Q&A.", "First you can see; we now had our 51st quarter of record results. And those results are in spite of the fact that we had anticipated both Q1 and Q2 of this year to be challenging due to difficult base year comps, GAAP period in our product introductions cycle and the response to earlier price challenges. I should also note that Q2 should be the last quarter where we expect our motor business to negatively impact our Americas growth rate. Q2 represented a few milestones and I'll be remissive if we pass by this call and I didn't note them. This was the first quarter in the company's history that we surpassed $200 million in revenue for a single quarter. And I am very pleased to report that both the Americas and ex-Americas market both contributed over $100 million each, that\u2019s a very nice balance of geographic revenues.", "All right. Let's transition to talk you about the future and let me say this as a header note. I feel extremely optimistic about this industry as we look forward and I feel just as optimistic about the role that ResMed can play within this industry. And let me tell you why I feel that way. I'm going to cover three basic topics although there're certainly many more that we can go through. I'll talk about our planned, product introductions schedule, a heart failure clinical study that we're initiating and finally the preliminary decision by CMS to allow home sleep testing.", "First our planned new product introduction schedule. In this quarter, we are launching and in fact in the past few days we've launched two important new products in the Americas. First, the VPAP Auto, which is a bilevel device. The second is the Mirage Micro nasal mask. All right, first on to the VPAP Auto, so what's different about it? First it's our first bilevel product we introduced into the more compact S8 body. It is far smaller than our previous generations bilevel. Second, it will use the same accessory sets such as our S8 humidifier as we use with the more general S8 product line. This helps to provide scale economies for ResMed, while eliminating non-value added changes for our customers reducing their inventory challenges. Third, it's powered by a unique patented double-ended motor, it's the same motor that powers our S8 II CPAPs that we are currently selling outside the Americas.", "This motor is a core component in our next round of product introduction, because it vastly increases the efficiency of the motor, allowing us to increase performance, while simultaneously reducing noise generated by the device. Because noise is an important factor in user comfort and compliance, we feel this is going to be a very highly valued future of our customers and in fact since it's in the S8 II device that's been launched ex-U.S. we've already being receiving very positive feedback about that.", "The fourth value proposition for the VPAP Auto is the integration of our unique Easy-Breathe waveform and you will be hearing a lot more about the Easy-Breathe waveform in the coming months. The Easy-Breathe waveform is an extremely comfortable flow pattern that once again improves user comfort and as we know that's a major factor in driving compliance. So, we are very optimistic about the launch of the VPAP Auto, given the timing of the release we should see some of the impact in Q3 although it's going to be a partial impact in this quarter and more full impact in Q4.", "Second product we\u2019ve introduced within the past few days is the Mirage Micro Mask, and this is our first product introduction into the standard nasal mask category in four years. Just as the quadro set of new standard for a full-face mask performance, we believe the Mirage Micro will set a new standard for comfort, ease of fitting and performance within the standard nasal mask category.", "As we look to Q4, we should have a full quarter of impact both from the Mirage Micro and the VPAP Auto and then we are going to introduce another series of products during the fourth quarter. Let me go through those for just a minute. On the CPAP side, we will be introducing several of the S8 II product series in to market, in the Americas that we've already launched during Q2 in Europe or outside the Americas. Once again, the products will be powered by our unique double-ended motor technology that has allowed us to improve performance and at the same time lowering noise levels. Just like the VPAP Auto, we will retain the current S8 design and accessories in order to minimize transition challenges for our customers while maintaining our on supply chain scale efficiencies.", "Finally, we expect to be introducing of new mask product into the nasal pillows category also during Q4 and we will provide more detail on that product as the product launches. So as you can see, we've got a fantastic new product flow over next five months or so and it is a... it is a product line that is built up with innovative technologies, but is also consistent with our strategy of maintaining efficiencies with the customer in our own supply chain.", "All right, next I would like to address the industry drivers and first, let's talk about congestive heart failure. In January this year, we have begun the recruitment of our first patients into the predominantly European-based clinical study in heart failure. We've long noted the critical role of the treatment of SDB can have on very serious and very costly co-morbidities such as congestive heart failure, such as diabetes, hypertension and others. This study represents a very tangible stake in the ground of our commitment to both providing and generating value from the these co-morbidities. This study, which is intended to be conducted over a five or so year time frame is targeted to the use of adaptive servo-ventilation and very specifically to the use of the ResMed ACS2 product in severe heart failure patients.", "The primary end points measured by the end points, which are meaningful to the heart failure and to the payer communities, mortality and hospitalizations. The study will engage two primary critical medical specialties, cardiologists and respirologists or pulmonologists. Heart failure costs government billions of dollars per annum to treat and we're optimistic that the use of ResMed's adaptive servo-ventilation, very specifically the ACS2 products will provide clinical benefits but positive economic benefits. While we don't intend to report specifically on the study as it progresses, we'll provide updates as material information or results become available.", "Finally, let me briefly comment on the preliminary national coverage decision that CMS in December. First of all let me highlight that this decision is preliminary and a final decision is due out in mid March of this year. Now, our reading in the preliminary decision is that CMS has recognized that SVD is an enormous public health issue and they're seeking to increase the access to diagnose this in treatment of the 90% of the patients who have not yet been diagnosed or treated.", "We also see the decision as an indication that home testing will be complimentary to the current diagnostic pathway and we're hopeful and confident that our valued partners in the sleep community will continue to play a pivotal role in treating patients and we plan to support our partners as they evolve and thrive in this new environment. From the perspective of impact on the SVD device community, this represents an additional driver for growth over the long haul, and one more reason for us to believe that the industry continues to have bright prospects.", "We remain in an industry that is 90% unpenetrated and achieving sustainable industry growth in the 15% to 20% range is supported by these types of drivers. Now, importantly, there's some water to flow under the bridge before this decision is finalized, and before we feel its full impact in the industry. In general, medical community takes a bit of time to absorb change and it wouldn't be surprising to us if it is 18 months to 24 months to pass before this thing sorts itself out. Nonetheless, it remains a very positive change for the industry and one that we look forward to supporting.", "So in summary, we're very optimistic about the future of the industry and the role that ResMed can play in our industry's growth and we're looking forward to the positive forward momentum that we'll see not only from our new product introductions that we'll be seeing over the next five months, but also these positive developments in the industry as a whole. All right, with that why don't I take a break and turn it over to Q&A. Akiya?", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable of Natixis. Please proceed.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call here. Peter, I take this opportunity to thank you for all your help over the years and Kieran I guess you obviously been around for a while, but a formal welcome to the party here. Just obviously kind of the main... probably the big question that sticks out is the flow generators in the Americas. Can you just comment, I mean everything else looks great. Maybe that's a function in the motor business. Just if you can give us a little commentary on that.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean, I'll let Keith to handle part of it, let me just open it up. We're basically a gap period here. We've had some very difficult base year comparables that we are dealing with and it sort of peaks out in Q2, we have got the new product introductions that will be in the flow generator side, that will be coming forth, not only the VPAP Auto here in Q3, but also we are going to see in Q4 and quite frankly there is also a bit of pricing impact that was in those numbers as well. So little bit lower than we are used to, that's for sure. But again, we've got confidence as we move forward that will be flowing out of that. Keith, you got anything to add to that?", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Kieran I think that that is a pretty adequate job of going through the explanation, the only... but the only thing that I would add is that we\u2019ve also had some growth in our sales force over the course of the last year or so and as a result of that growth, we've had some promotions within the sales force, we've expanded some territories and added some new territories. Well, one of the things that we found is that it takes our reps about six months to really begin to ramp up to a level of productivity once they come on board, and fortunately we are at the point where those reps, those new reps that we've added are now clearing that six month productivity and moving towards nine months.", "So with the refreshing of the product line which gives us an opportunity to really get the sales force excited about what they are selling and the combination of the reps becoming more mature in what they are doing, I think that that's something we look forward to.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. And then just a follow-up, can you guys just talk about the sort of overall health of the market here. I know you sort of alluded to it but obviously just obviously with you and Respironics out there and I guess as it relates to may be home diagnostics, are we expecting sort of some change here with people kind of ready, maybe holding back as things get, and then obviously expect a pick up when it sort of goes full swing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. So... I think periods of changes there is always short-term opportunity for people to sort of look and question what their role is, but the general signals in the market is positive one at this point. I think that the home\u2026 the preliminary decision on home testing certainly is one that bodes extremely well for the long-term access of the patients for the diagnostics process and removes some of the bricks and mortars limitations that may have been governor on growth as we've seen in the past. So near term, there is certainly going to be some jockeying for position out there, as various members of the medical community determine what the role is that they are going to play in this new world going forward. But I suspect that we'll yield some more positive contribution versus negative side. I think the changes are good.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. Well thanks a lot. Great job guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills of Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Thank you and how are you. Wanted to follow-up Kieran if I can on the last question or the last answer about some of the constituents within the supply chain here are jockeying for positions, I'm trying to figure out how they could fit in. Could you elaborate on that a bit further, specifically it seems that we are seeing growth in the number of beds which is an underlying variable that is important for growth in the underlying market. However may be not as robust as you've seen in years past and perhaps that is because folks in the supply chain are trying to figure out what is going... what the markets or what the environment is going to look like after the final decision. Could you help us understand what you see in terms of growth in the number of sleep labs currently and how you think that will change as folks sort of figure out how... where they fit in?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So part of this is... information we have directed sort of detail or data, and part of it's going to be more just looking at the market and we are providing--.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Sure.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But, we're seeing continued growth on the sleep lab PSG, capacity side but let's face it, if we are looking for the real growth in the capacity that's going to be this home testing as it comes through, because then it moves well beyond the bricks and mortars and we're all going to have a look at a different indicators of growth as we move forward. And as far as I'm concerned that\u2019s a very positive thing, right because it demonstrates that there is going to be more ways of growing capacity. It's good to see that sleep labs continue to expand some of their capacity because we feel [inaudible] important role within\u2026 in this\u2026 in the diagnostic process. There were to be a certain amount of the patients that will be able to be fully tested and diagnosed with home testing and there will be a certain amount of those patients which are going to need more comprehensive care, such as those, let's say in complex sleep apnea that are going to need the help and support of that in the lab diagnostic process. So we are pleased to see that they'll continue to do that. So in general... again I guess I can only say that there are various players who have spoke up that are waiting for the final decision, but are looking to get in the gap to actively engage.", "There is some members in the sleep community, they feel they can play a very important role as part of the hub-and-spoke model of engaging other specialists and primary care physicians. You\u2019ve heard public statements from home medical equipment providers, who feel that they can provide a role in helping to accelerate the diagnostics rate by getting engaged in home testing. I suspect that there will be other players that will get involved in that as well. So from our view is we try to borrow [ph] that down and say what does that mean from an industry perspective, and I got it clear everything that we are seeing in that is extremely positive, it means that there is going to be more awareness building that there will be more interested parties in various stages of the market that will be looking to try to take those 90% of the patients who remain undiagnosed, and try to find a complimentary path way to help them reach therapy.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Great, that's very helpful, just two quick follow-ups here, I don\u2019t if they are quick, but I'll try to make them quick. So I understand how that would impact positively perhaps longer term, near term\u2026 perhaps some of an impact that we won't see the final decision until March. So from what you've laid out we have this environment for you, we have new products and easier year-over-year comparisons and perhaps still some jockeying for physician as a modest option. So, with that said as we look into the near term to the second half of your fiscal year, could you helps a little bit with respect to your expectations for the growth, especially in our U.S. business but also the ability to maintain the growth you put up this quarter in the international business given what's lying in front of you for the next couple of quarters?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So obviously the\u2026 anything to do with the home testing, actually one point of clarification before I start, when I say the jockeying for position I mean that's our positive side, I don't know that's an offset at this point so.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But if we go to the next stage, obviously in the international side they are not going to be influence or impacted by the home testing, really what\u2019s driving that is positive introduction of the SA-2 it's been a very well received product into that market, as well as some of the new mass products, as well as quite frankly execution. We have been improving in many areas of the world, we\u2019ve been improving our execution, so I feel very good about that piece, obviously the piece that\u2019s influence by currency is lot [ph]. But, as far as the execution the basic fundamentals of the business I feel very good about the way that the team is performing and the basic stable of products that we have. On the America side as we move forward we've been stating here for quite a number of quarters is that, we felt that Q1 and Q2 were going to be difficult because of the product gaps and some of the base year comps and sort of absorbing some of the pricing channels. And then as we move through Q3 and Q4, we are beginning to get into that product flow in Q3 and a bit more product flow in Q4, and we have proved... we expect that we will begin climbing back during that period back to market rates of growth. So, we continue to feel comfortable with that assessment.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Great. And then last question, I will get back in queue, regarding gross margins. I mean, just sort of in plain speak here, have we seen the trough in gross margins? I think 60% was kind of a line that most of us wanted to see sort of stabilize that and can we see expansion from here giving clearly a lot of what you have talked about with respect to the new product suggest efficiencies are being worked into the manufacturing facilities, and I guess it speaks to how can that sort of be a greater influence to your gross margins relative to the price pressure you have seen in with respective ladder. Do we expect to see that abate a bit as Respironics becomes part of a larger organization that probably is more interested in sales\u2026 interested in running a profitable business.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think you have got a short-term element to that question, you have longer-term element of that question, and would I be looking for margin expansion in the next few quarters? No, I think that will be difficult to look for. One of the very comforting things of this market is that many of the pricing pressures that we talked about six months ago, nine months ago, it seems that there has been a floor established in the market. We are not seeing price levels drop below where we had seen some of the deals, six and nine months ago. On the flip side of that, you do have obviously more customers as we have said it is going to happen here, more customers who are getting this price level. So what you are going to see externally during that time period is a bit continued pressure on ASPs here over the next few quarters, but again the good news is we are not seeing... it is simply an expansion to more customers. That's a very classic way of what happens in price in this market.", "So, a lot of the gross margin improvements that... and some of the fundamental drivers that we would see really come with significant changes in the product evolution, and that we would see in sort of next generations of product and some of the changes that we are working on behind the seasons in the supply chain. So near-term, would I be looking for expansion? No. Are we fundamentally doing the right things to continue to reduce our cost of goods over the longer haul, absolutely.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wachovia. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "Sure. I guess, just wanted to ask you again a little bit about your confidence level in a rebound, I mean the comps obviously do get easier, but the growth in the US does seem to have slowed pretty substantially and the numbers that are out there show, I mean the consensus estimate shows a fair bit of acceleration in the next couple of quarters. Are you comfortable with those?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I don't comment on any specific sort of numbers that are out there, but let me talk a little bit more in general, Michael. So, again these first couple of quarters, we did have very difficult base year comps, and we in a gap in the product flow etc. As we move into the Q3 and Q4, again we are climbing back towards market levels of growth. So, do I feel comfortable with that? Yes, I do feel comfortable that we can climb back towards those levels. I am not here saying that we are going to get back to where we were a year and half ago at 45% and 50% growth levels. I don't think that would be reasonable to assume, but I do think that we have some very good positive momentum to get back to market levels to grow.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "Okay and then, I was wondering if your growth... are you going to do anything to try to rein in the SG&A and R&D levels, given further growth in those expenditures, given the slowing revenue growth that we are seeing, because they... they were growing a little faster, I think in your overall revenue growth in the quarter, I realized some of that might have due to currency?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, big part of it was due to currency, I think Brett had given the breakout on\u2026 for instance on R&D and the growth in constant currency and we're substantially lower. At this point, feel very comfortable particularly in R&D line with the amount of investment that we are providing into the business and, when you are in a market that\u2019s 90% untapped, our view is this is not the time to take your foot of the accelerator. So we are doing the smart things I think in the sense that as the currency is going a bit against us, we have slowed constant currency growth of those, but we are going to starve the business. We simply\u2026 this is simply the wrong phase of this industry's growth. And particularly, when you look at all the good things that are happening whether it is the\u2026 the home testing decision that we are looking forward to in March, already we talk about some of the data that's coming out in the co-morbidity, be it congestive heart failure, the study I think is going to be very important over the long haul both the payers as well as to the clinical community, and in areas such as diabetes and occupational health there are so many aspects in this market that are untapped, that our job is to keep this market growing and to participate more than our fair share in that growth and so, I think now is the wrong time for us to look at any substantial leverage of that.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "All right, and then I guess just two product related questions on some of your recently introduced products, I guess not that recent, but the Adapt SV and then the Tango kind of at the low and high end of the markets, just any updates you can gives us there on the progress with those products?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes both are playing their role, the Adapt SV remains, and remember the Adapt SV is also known as the ACS 2 in Europe, so it remains a core element of our strategic growth as we move forward and it is the basis of this congestive heart failure study. So we continue to gain traction in the understanding awareness of complex sleep apnea and we continue to focus on the significant role that a complaint [ph] congestive heart failure outside the U.S. As far as the Tango, I remember is really two different parts to the strategy behind Tango, on one side it was basically to pick up some great, it was\u2026 we haven't traditionally participated in that very low-end part of the market. And the idea was when you are on a sales call and they are buying those low end, let's participate, we are doing okay in that area, that is not really our core skill set, we tend to sell higher technology, we tend to sell algorithms that make a difference and focus on other aspects of the sales process.", "So I'll say that we are doing all right, we are certainly not hitting out of the park with the part of it. The other part of the Tango of course was more of a, sort of strategic blocking strategy overtime. And not for any particular competitor or any particular risk on the horizon, but we got a nice market here and one other things that we look to do is to create barriers to entry over time, and if you look at the most rational place that a competitor might try to enter the market it would be where the intellectual property barriers and the technology barriers low switches, the low end CPAP and it has done an effective job I think in that side of the market, which is to create a bit of block.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "All rights that's all I've got thanks.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great for asking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Lee of Caris & Company. Please proceed.", "Timothy Lee - Caris & Company", "Hi. Good afternoon. Kieran, can you just give us your thoughts on how do you think the market dynamics may change here with Respironics in the hands of the Philips, I mean do you think we are ahead into a era of greater pricing stability and\u2026 Keith it will get as well I guess given his experience with Philips as a part of heart chain [ph]?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. That will be great. So in... obviously the waters got to flow under the bridge here. So, we're sitting here trying to predict the future. But, I can tell you that my view on the acquisitions is I'm very positive on it, I think it's great. And I think in a lot of ways it's great validation of the growth prospects in this industry, I think it's recognition of this industry being highly under penetrated and I think, having a large well known brand entering the marketplace should help us in creating awareness within the industry and creating awareness within the various medical cilo [ph]. So, I'm very positive and very optimistic about the future and Philips\u2019 entry into the marketplace.", "As far as pricing, we will have to see how that flows. I encouraged to note the reputation of their company is usually to sell on value on a market expansion and value being bringing new and innovative ideas to the marketplace. That's the kind of market that we think is appropriate, again for such an under penetrated market. So my view is that it's a positive development and I am looking forward to working with them in market expansion and obviously competing with them in the appropriate manner. Keith, you have anything to add to that?", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Kieran, I would just say that I agree with you 100% on the perspective that Philips sells on the basis of value, they also have a history of growing markets, which is one of the things that lot of us are very excited about. We... ResMed has spent a lot of time growing individual market segments. Respironics has spent a lot time as a close follower. We view Philips as a company that will invest in the market growth and put as much time into the development driving, more people into the diagnostic channel and the therapeutic channel as we are. So, we are very excited about this.", "Timothy Lee - Caris & Company", "One last if I may just, can you give us your current thoughts on how you think competitive bidding is going to play out in the marketplace?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Again, water is got to flow under the bridge there. We will wait to see what the... how the results pan out there and you know what bids are accepted and what not. We hear mixed things from the marketplace. As with anything before the final pronouncements, you get plenty of rumors running around. And the good thing here is that, you know, CMS was running a bit higher on the pricing than you'll see at most managed care and other payers, so there's room to move on that to start with. And from our perspective, it's 10% of our global sales 20% of our U.S. sales and so we think we are still well positioned to compete there. But, it's not a direct impact on us, it's an indirect impact.", "Timothy Lee - Caris & Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew of William Blair please proceed.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Good afternoon Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Just few things I wanted to follow-up on. First, if you look at the U.S. generator growth versus the international and you normalize for currency, what's your sense about how important the driver the new generators have been on the constant currency generator growth overseas and should we see that really kicking in quickly here in the third fiscal quarter with the new product?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes great question. So you know the... a large part of the S8 II impact has not even really been felt in the ex-U.S. market. It was launched during the quarter and so you have the product introduction time and depending on what market you are in, you either see a delayed impact or you see it more similar to what you see in the Americas. France would be an example of where you see it more quickly. Germany would be an example of where there's a multi-month delayed impact on that. So, what I can speak to is all leading indicators and the signals and the feedback we've had from market and I got to tell that people are responding very well.", "And the thing that they seem to be keen on is the difference in this motor technology. I... they are getting the concept, that is like changing the engine in your car and it is very different, I mean it is much more efficient the... motor spins at a slower rate and yet it gives higher performance and that all leads to a major issue in this market place which is how do you reduce noise, and so it provides wins in each of those segments. So, all the indicators that we had out of the ex-US market place today have been extremely positive. And I think it will have a very positive impact on our ability to sell in the Americans, to be able to not inconvenience our customers by making them change their accessories and what not, and yet giving them a whole new engine to the car. So, its ... I think the signals [ph] are good.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "So, if you look at the US generator growth and what is really going on here, you were down 7%, what's mix? I mean, what is price and then what's units? Are units down, you know, units flat and prices down $10.15 [ph], what's going on?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think when we are down, we are down about 2% in the flow generator right?", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Excuse me, I am sorry, I was thinking on the plus 7 on the total, so minus two, but what is going on there?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right, so it is a little bit of both. Clearly you had some, some price in that, but for the most part I still have to say that flow generator on a volume basis is flat, so it may not have gone backwards, but it's flat. And part of that is the various elements that I noted earlier, I mean part of that to difficult base... part of that is the product gap. We were sort of in anticipation of these changes to the S8, where we can introduce some new feature sets and introduce some new value props, and some of that is, some of the are points that the Keith has noted, but--.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But I don\u2019t know, Keith do you have anything to add to that?", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "I would just say that, when you look at the S81, it is a product platform that is 10 or 11 quarters old and our competitor has had a ref... a new product introduction during that period of time, the momentum swung in their direction, the S82 with the new motor and the, and the noise factor and the easy breath capability is something around our organization is looking for very strongly to bring significant life into what we were doing. It is\u2026 for intends and purposes we will view it as a new product introduction and we are very exited about it, it depend and will swing back.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, and so then just kind of finishing up on the generator side..", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "But then, let me interrupt you for a second, because I don\u2019t think Kieran caught this in his response back to you, you asked specifically about Q3, that product will be introduced into the US at the beginning of Q4.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "All right, yes you got that\u2026 but you got the S8 platforms for the VPAP and there is\u2026 it may help a little bit I guess.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Exactly.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, so if you think...", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "Partial quarter impact.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Sure. So if you think about though the impact of the Adapt SV, I mean this a very high dollar price system. What sort of impact is that having? Is that $5 million product a quarter at this point and is that keeping the core generator business from being down 5 or 10 on a unit basis, or is this all generally flattish?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "W haven't broken out that, that piece in the past and so I\u2026 I don\u2019t feel comfortable at this point going below that on sort of the mix analysis, but in general I think it's fair to say that, that when you look at the materiality of the impact, the flow generators is flat to down a little bit, and I think that\u2019s\u2026 it is a fair assessment and a conclusion to walk away with them.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, and just one quick question for Brett if you are still around. The tax rate in the quarter, can you kind of walk me through what's going on there and what we should expect for the balance of the year please?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, hi Ben. So, the tax rate for this quarter was 30.9% the effective tax rate, which is pretty similar to Q1. I expect the balance of FY '08, it will be around that level as well.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay. So no changes there and then finally on CapEx, you obviously see the impacts of the facility build out in San Diego. What's your thought on that and how long that's going to run at kind of a higher level, and is there any additional CapEx for facilities expected beyond that new facility?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "No, so we're pretty much through, we had some extension for the manufacturing facility down here in Sydney, which was completed in December, so that's pretty much through there. So, now we've got the county Mysore [ph] facility that\u2019s been constructed, it is due to finish around March 2009, and roughly [inaudible] a quarter on CapEx for that facility.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you, Brett may be some housekeeping questions with respect to currency, can you, first give us what your FX assumptions are for the, in terms of the total impact for the rest of this year?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "If I could tell you what the currency is going to do, I could probably do that but I think, I mean you just don't know where we're going to go with currency particularly at the moment where it's pretty volatile. But clearly we have some hedging in place, which mitigates to some extent. I think, and I am looking at... I don't think we're going to get a perishable movements out of next year for a while in the Euro or the all the end.", "When you look at how various analyst predictions, some are up and some are down. So I think we just continue to manage as we've done and in terms of the impact though if you're looking at, there was one thing this quarter what might be in the next few quarters. Suppose if the currencies wash through you probably looking at the sort of impact over the next few quarters, barring any major movements in the currency.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great very good. So then in terms of, as we think of margins impact over the quarter here, we should think of the gross margin perhaps being relatively flat with the room for potential little bit of improvement [inaudible] is that the correct way of thinking about it?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I mean, not too much more add that Kieran said at the moment it is around 60% in the short term we likely get any expansion on that, probably not. But if you look at September to December that margin was around the sort of 60% mark with the whole various factors, obviously some mix in our performance in March generally speaking would mean that you'd get some benefit on the margin.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Pretty good and then one question, I'll put it either Kieran or Keith, in terms of the S8 recall, can give us some update please on what you stand on that in terms of completion and remediating it and how long do you expect will take complete please.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll throw that to Keith.", "Keith Serzen - Chief Operating Officer, Americas", "So we believe that\u2026 well first of all there is two different ways to break that down one is the world\u2026 the ROW recall which I think that this point is pretty well on it, pretty much on suite to total completion. In the U.S. we believe that we are about 70% completed with this, we believe that we are at the point where there is no further distraction to the sales force or very minimal going forward. But we also believe that they will be in this for another probably one to two quarters, which is what we had anticipated when the first announced the recall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith of JPMorgan, please proceed.", "Alex Smith - JPMorgan", "Hi, guys. Just a question on the heart failure trails. How much is that going to cost in terms of financing and can you give us some... are going to be trying for that or someone else.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, we will be funding it, and Brett you want to go through the estimates?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So it will be... looking at the study it will be ... it's around 4 years to 5 years 4.5 years with the total cost of between $10 million and $12 million over that period of time. Spread reasonably evenly, but you might get little bit of a kick up in FY \u201809 on that study. But in terms of the total funding it's around that $10 million to $12 million over that period. To the extent, we will have quickly that... we go through that spending depends on how quickly you recruit through the clinical trial and so on. But in terms of overall ballpark figures that's what we're talking about.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, let me just...", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "In fact in addition to the 7% or so as you spend on R&D or part of that on going commitment?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "That will be part of the on going commitment we think we'll run around the 7% to 8% including funding that trial.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And I guess another question is obviously with that home testing the roll of auto setting devices becomes a bit more important in terms of setting the pressures in the home. Kieran, do you think that we could see a mix shift towards IPAPs as the CMS ruling does come through pretty much as the proposal?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think, again I think we have to wait for\u2026 see how the proposals pull through the finish line here. But certainly you would think it would open the opportunity for the additional use of auto setting technologies. There is the whole question of how the titration event occurs at home if the diagnostic process happens at home. One of the great benefits of auto setting technology is that it adjusts night-by-night, day-by-day over the entire time period of the individual user. So, it is absolutely perfectly tailored to those types of opportunities and I should note that, we did not waste any time... as soon as preliminary decision came out within a couples of weeks we were back as we have before. We're trying to take advantage to see if we can get increased compensation, and increased reimbursement for our customer to be able to supply those auto-setting devices.", "So it is long shot, I wouldn\u2019t necessary model in success at this point, but I think it that\u2026 there was a very good economic rationale for the increased use of auto setting, it's going to simplify the process, it's going to improve patient care, it's going to reduce the expense of the HMEs in handling these patients. But I think they need be to appropriate compensated. So we're going to drive on that. Just one more on, by the way on the congestive heart side, I don't pass by that question without noting. This is a very significant event for us, I think in putting a stake in the ground of congestive heart failure. We've talked quite a bit about the co-morbidities and we've taken some significant actions over time. But, this is a very interesting pivotal study that should help demonstrate benefits in both mortality and hospitalization and that's an important aspect in the health economics and the continued reimbursement in this area. So, it's a very important role and leadership role that we're taking in this market.", "And in addition, there is a side benefit, what you're doing there, is you're the increasing the awareness and the understanding of the role that adaptive servo-ventilation plays within the heart failure community and we look forward to generating benefit during the life of that study. So, it's a very important study from multiple aspects.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Kieran you mentioned that you've basically applying to get a new for an IPAP, how long do you think that process might take?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Why don\u2019t I throw that over to David Pendarvis who leads many of our efforts in that area.", "David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General Counsel", "As you know, we\u2019ve gone through this code this the past and haven't received it. So as Kieran said, we don't want everybody immediately model in, increase reimbursement for our automatic device, but that would come up during the first half of calendar '08 and again that's at the CMS level. So, as with all of these things both home testing and any increased reimbursement, that impacts the U.S. Medicare reimbursement first and anything that would happen positively would take a while to roll through the commercial payers throughout the rest of the US. So, we look forward if we got something positive, we would hope to see it answer in the first half of the year.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks very much guys.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, thank you for taking the question. You told us that FX was a negative penny contributor to EPS. What was the impact of the top line?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Joanne it is Brett. Yes, on the top line, we had favorable currency movements at around $10 million to the revenue number.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. How many patients are you going to be having in your congestive heart failure trial?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The objective is 1200 patients. So, it's quite a sizable study, particularly for this industry it's certainly the largest study of its nature.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "And on previous conference you have talked about the OSI market growing 15% to 20% and your goal or wasn't a goal because I know guys don\u2019t give guidance. But would be around getting to sort of within that range for '08. What are you currently thinking?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, we historically said that we believe the ex-US market growth is about 10% to 15% per annum and that the Americas market, where we expect to grow at 15% to 20% per annum as an average basis. And so, when you blend those things together, you're somewhere around that 15% plus range. So, we continue to feel comfortable that in the long range that that's the growth prospects of the industry, certainly there will be sometimes when it is a little bit above and little bit below that and we've seen that over the past x number of years. And I'll just say again, I'm just extremely comfortable and pleased with some of the signals for the long-term health and growth in this marketplace, particularly with the home testing.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. But am trying to get the arms around... a couple of other people are trying to do... It sounds like if...are we at a trough, do you move out of it and what is your pace of moving out of it? I know comps getting easier, I know you've got new products, I know you don't like to give guidance. Can you just start to put some gate on some numbers though?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Well, Again I think we'll continue to try to give you the directional piece of it we been giving. Do we think we've troughed [ph] in the America side of this, yes I think we have, and we expect to be pulling out of that. As we go through Q3 and Q4, we've got a partial impact to some new products in Q3, we've got some partial impact of other new products in Q4 and some of that get the full balance. So, our objective is to start to get back towards market rates of growth as we get towards the end of this fiscal year and then take it for there into the next year. So, to answer you directly do we feel like we've troughed in the Americas, yes that's certainly our expectation.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall of UBS. Please proceed.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Thanks very much Kieran. And congratulations in taking out the roll there. Just, I guess just thinking, I guess did node the head with home diagnosis, obviously a potential power driver for the industry. We are sort of hearing, I guess some mechanizing of home healthcare dealers and so on putting plants in place. Could you give us some indication of sort of what steps you might be taking over the sort of next 6 to 12 months and whether there is any cost involved. Just to I guess align yourself to sort of take advantage?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so I think that will become more and more clear as we get to a final decision and we understand what's in and what's out, right in there is...", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Yes.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Slight variables in this decision. Type 3, Type 4 devices who are... is going to be able to be involved in the process with the titration penetration process that is going to be acceptable how that going to be reimbursed. So there is some pieces in here that can influence the role that we can play and who will be addressing that. So at this point, I don't anticipate that we have certainly any increased expenditures to support that, and if an opportunity arises and we think that we can see a way of stimulating growth extremely quickly, would we jump on it, you bet. Is that immediately obvious at this point? No its not, I think at this point we and others have... already have technologies, so we've got the ApneaLink which is a very unique device and very powerful device that will certainly satisfy the requirements for the Type 4. There are others that have that and there is a number of suppliers in Type 3, which is good, because that indicates that there is number of players that from an industry perspective can supply devices that can get these devices in the hands to those who need to use them and our intention is to work with our partners that we work with through for quite sometimes support sweet communities as they evolve through this process and most importantly to support the patient outcomes, how can we help them drive to access for more patients. So at this point, again the short answer to your question, we are looking for some significant expenditures in support of this, I don't see that at this point.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "It sounds like next quarter question bit more details with the decision but, perhaps a quick follow on just actually Germany had been weak in previous quarters obviously could read down rest of all with currency. Could you perhaps just sort of outline were Germany is out at the moment, maybe any [inaudible]?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, yes so Germany as a results perspective continues to be relatively flat, that being said I think we are making very significant progress in a lot of aspects of the German organization in the German market. The new management team has been there for about a year, they took a bit of timing, see underneath them and they have made some very positive changes. The thing to remember is that the German marketplace we're home medical equipment provider and so when we make changes there is this process\u2026 for instance with the S8 II, you put the S8 II out there, you need to get out last, then there is a, often a three-month period were you have introduction not only to the physicians but then there is trial periods for the patients. Then there prescription is written and then we have to chase down the payment on that prescription over another 90 days.", "So as a result, when you start seeing some positive indicators, you start seeing the flow through a little bit later and then in addition to that course you have deferred revenue etcetera, I mean the service contracts. So Germany, we tend to look for the sort of positive signals of improvement such as in prescription rates or other aspects of the market and we've started to see that. So I'm comfortable that Germany is beginning the slow road back to recovery and it seems in good shape. What that does indicate is that other parts of ex-Americas are doing quite well, we've got A-Pac [ph] that\u2019s doing quite well. We have other countries within Europe, such as France and the UK that are really hitting the ball out of the park and that's both because of the product stream and because of a fundamental execution. So, it's a mix bag and... but the mixed bag is for the most part... Germany still serving that flat range, but signals of improvement, but other than that very, very good progress.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And that is all the questions we have for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran Gallahue. Please proceed.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. I appreciate the interest and then the questions. As you can see we did have some challenges in Q2 and particularly some challenges in Americas, but I would like to leave the call with a highlight that I am feeling very optimistic about where this market can head in long term. We have some very good short-term signals, and if you look at our product flow over the coming five to six months we are very encouraged by what it's going to mean to the organization and what it's going to mean to the sleep community [ph]. So I look forward to updating you on future calls and demonstrating our progress. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Angela, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, the company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as, projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products.", "These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Angela and welcome all of you to ResMed's Q3 2008 conference call. I am going to start the call today with some remarks and I am going to pass the ball over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer and he will review the results in more detail then will come and open up for Q&A.", "Well Q3 was our 52nd quarter of consecutive growth and was a strong quarter for us as we grew our revenues by 16% on a global basis and we grew our earnings per share by 12% on a global basis. As well as generating over $33 million in cash flow from operations. In particular, this was a great quarter to reinforce the strategy of ResMed globalization. Right from beginning of this company, we focused on two things. Innovation and internationalization and this was a great quarter to reap some of the rewards of that as we saw the international business contributing significantly to our growth in the quarter.", "Let me, I think step back for minute and review some of the results. From a product perspective, Mask grew up 21% on a global basis and that Mask growth was supported by not only existing products, but also the introduction of new product of the product category. We introduced the Mirage Micro nasal mask. It's the first major release of technologies that work horse nasal mask section of the business in last four years. It came in promptly through the quarter. It has been received very well through, from the market place and it's just a great product. It helps in set up. It took the lot of the advantages that we saw in Mirage Quattro, full face mask integrated in nasal platform and we are getting similar reviews as we did Quattro indicating that the ease of use in setup, the efficacy of the products are absolutely fabulous. We are very pleased with the early introductory days of the Mirage Micro.", "Full face mask continue to be strong performance for us, particularly the Mirage Quattro, product in the and high-end of the full face mask line, so very strong productive category for us. Nasal pillows was a bit more of a mixed category for us. We continue to have the Swift II product line which has performed very well and continues to have a large share in fact the vast majority of the share of the nasal pillows market place. We have seen some competitive pressures in that in the last couple of quarters. They continued in this quarter. The good news on that by the way is that within the next week at Medtrade, we will be launching a new product into the nasal pillows category to product called the Swift LT. And we are going to introduce it as in adjunct. So not a replacement for the Swift II, but it has enough new feature sets and it is differentiated enough that it deserves its own place in the product category. So moving forward, we will have both those products the Swift II and the Swift LT and nasal pillows category and we're looking forward to some strong success out of that product line.", "Alright, let me move over to the Flow Generators, flow generators and global basis were up 11% and this was an area where in particular we had certain light on, that really performed well. As an example, in the Bilevel range, we have our VPAP series. And we introduced something called the VPAP Auto, midway through the last quarter. And again, this product came out of the gates very strongly. We're very encouraged by the early days of the launch and look forward to strong days ahead with the VPAP Auto. A key element of the VPAP Auto is that it merges a couple of technologies. On one side, it brings in the auto setting out rhythms that we've used in the APAP line for years. The market leading preemptive, very efficacious product category or algorithm used in the AutoSet APAP line.", "But it's also integrated something you're going to be hearing a lot more about, which is the Easy-Breath technology. And the Easy-Breath technology is really... it's a product category of platform under which we have both waveforms, as they're intended to improve patient's compliance and improve the efficacy of treatment. As well as a new motor, which is bring substantial value to the product line, in fact it was the basis of the very successful S8 II product line that we've launched in the international markets. The Easy-Breathe technology is a double-ended motor, that allows us to improve performance and it vastly, vastly decreases the noise. We've got a saying here that silence is compliance, it's because it's so important in order to reduce noise levels for both the patient and for the bed partner. And this is an example of where we're bringing that technology to bear [ph] and Bilevel, so good early days on that.", "On the higher end flow generators such as the AutoSet line, we continue to do well and we believe is a share gain position and that high-end of the market place. And very importantly and very, from a very exciting point from our view is as we speak we're launching new products in the Americas, into that category. So we're launching the S8 II Vantage [ph] and the S8 II (sic) [S8 Elite II]. The market overall will see it next week at Medtrade. It uses again that basic Easy-Breathe technology platform, both the waveforms as well as the very silent and high-performance Easy-Breathe motor. So we we're very excited about that.", "It's been a successful launch that we launched several months ago in international markets and its part of the contribution to our significant growth in those international markets. Lower end flow generated a bit more of a mixed bag there. What we have been finding is that a, certain feature set and particularly that feature set is expiratory, pressure release, where you have that up and down of the pressure in order to improve comfort and therefore, compliance among patients. We've seen that, there's been significant growth of that feature set in the low-end. It is not a feature set that we've had and as a result we've had some competitive pressures in that end of our product line. Good news here is that we will be releasing a product. We are going to call the S8 II escape with Easy-Breathe technology, alright with EPR, with Expiratory Pressure Relief. And that will be launched later in this quarter, will not be released to Medtrade, but will be released later in this quarter, and we'll begin shipping we believe before the end of the quarter.", "So non-material impact in this quarter, but great news as we move forward in plugging a whole, that we have in the product line that will allows us to be more competitive. Alright, let me take step back for just moment and talk about the market overall, I'd like to address two areas. One is co-morbidities and the other is home testing. Just to set the tones for the market as we move forward. This last quarter was actually very interesting and very encouraging quarter from the co-morbidity perspective, in particular, in the area of diabetes and the overlap between type II diabetes and sleep disorder breathing. There were several papers that were published in peer-reviewed journals that I think were important to this. One in particular was Vancorder et. al. [ph] in Chest that was released, I believe in February, and it was a review article looking at literature, that associated and that determined the overlap between sleep disorder breathing and Type II diabetes.", "What was really interesting about this is, is that it was a cross over that was, it was published in this clinical literature, but you saw very soon thereafter that there was pick-up in the more general press and that's always an important aspect for us as we look to move from the clinical silos in to the more general awareness and speaks well for future market expansion. In particular, many of you may have seen the 60 minute segments, several weeks ago, where they actually had two segments that featured two of the authors on that paper, Edward Tuscali and Eva Vancorder [ph] and they were only talking about sleep fragmentation and deprivation, not the full boat of sleep disorder breathing, but the end results become the same. They were showing that with healthy young males in their early 20s that, if you are sleep deprive them even for a couple of days then you start to see the symptoms of pre-diabetes.", "And it is very interesting way of beginning to educate the public on this overlap between type II diabetes and sleep disorder breathing, why its important to treat the sleep disorder breathing and to appropriately allow people to sleep without that fragmentation and be able to take away some of the other negative effects of sleep disorder breathing and why it should help in what is considered there other primary disorder to the extent that you want to call it.", "So very encouraging news, there is other news in that category, I won't go to depth on it, but it's important for us to note when we have these significant movements on the co-morbidity side. The other significant development during the quarter was in home testing in the Americas, in the United States. Many of you are aware that during the quarter, that the CMS, it's a Medicare came out with its final ruling on the national coverage decision for the use of home testing for the diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing. And in fact their final ruling confirmed their preliminary ruling from December and the net result is that they have approved home testing. They have approved in conjunction with polysomnography, so either course is acceptable in the determination of sleep disorder breathing and the movement of those patients into the care cycle to allow them to get treatment.", "Now as this rolls out, we believe this is going to be absolutely fantastic news for the patients and we believe for the sleep community. It's going to take a good 12 to 18 months. We still believe that in order for water to flow under the bridge and for us to see any material impact of these types of the developments. There is multiple steps that need to occur with movement from a national coverage decision to local coverage decisions having private insurers pick up the coverage of home testing and one, Aetna, a very large one has already picked it up which I think was a very positive signal and I suspect over the coming quarters we'll see others that will also pick up the coverage of home testing.", "Key for us during this time period as we intend to support our partners in sleep community, we feel that in this changing environment that they can play a very important role in expanding the access of care to patients integrating a home testing along with their PSG in the treatment of their patients. And it will also give other parts of the healthcare community incentives to be engaged in the diagnoses process. So the key here is a couple of developments along the co-morbidity side, one on the home testing side, both which we think are very, very health indicators for the growth of the market as we move forward. Both which have some time line associated with, but both which we think are going to have significant long-term impact.", "So instead of continuing on that one, I turn the phone over Brett, Brett will go through the results in more detail and it will come back and take your questions. Brett.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Great thanks Kieran. So I'll briefly run through our March quarter results. Revenue for the March quarter was $211.8 million, an increase of 16% over the prior quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $12 million to our Q3 revenues. Our income from operations are $37.4 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $29.7 million. Diluted earnings per share for the current quarter was $0.38 which represents an increase of 12%, compared to the prior year quarter that's excluding voluntary product recall expenses that we recognized in the March, quarter last year.", "SG&A for the quarter was $70.1 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A increased by modest 6% over the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 33%, compared to the year ago figure of 34%. R&D expense for the quarter was $15 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expense was consistent with prior year. As the percentage of revenue, our R&D was 7% and again this was consistent with the year ago figure.", "With our ongoing commitment to innovation, solid product pipeline and some clinical trial commitments, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continue in the 7% range through the balance of FY '08. Amortization of the acquired intangibles is $2 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.6 million. During the March quarter, there were three non-routine transactions that impacted our net income and I will run through these. First, we made a gain of $5.9 million on the completion of the previously announced sell and leaseback transaction on our Poway property in San Diego.", "Second, we recognized an expense of $3.2 million associated with the write-down of certain at cost investments. And third, we made a $2 million donation for the ResMed Foundation during the quarter. The aggregated net after-tax, impact of these transactions was a decrease in net income of approximately $0.2 million. So the bottom-line impact of all those transactions was negligible.", "Turning to revenues in more detail, overall, Americas sales was $99.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior quarter. Sales outside of the Americas totaled $112.2 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year quarter. Breaking out revenues between products segments, in the Americas flow generators were 5% lower, than the prior year quarter. While masks and other increased by 13%, reflecting the continuation of strong sales in our new product introductions.", "For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 23% over the prior year quarter, reflecting increasing in momentum in S8 II sales, while masks and others increased by 33% again driven by strong new product sales.", "As Kieran indicated on a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 11% while mask and other on a group basis increased by 21%.", "Cash flow from operations was $33.9 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $17.3 million and this included a $7.5 million in building construction costs associated with new headquarters in San Diego. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $14.7 million. We received $24.7 million in cash from the sale of our Poway property and these funds will be utilized for the ongoing construction of our San Diego headquarters. During the quarter, we also repurchased 575,000 shares for consideration of $23.3 million, despite our ongoing share buyback program and today on this program.", "We've repurchased 3.5 million shares out of a total approved buyback of $8 million shares. Looking at the balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong total assets at the end of the March were $1.4 billion and net equity is $1.1 billion. Cash in cash equivalents, net of our external debt was $175 million at the end of March.", "I would now like to hand the call back to Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great, thanks Brett. Well, why don't we jump right into the Q&A section? So Angela if you could lead us there, please.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, we would ask that you limit your self to one question and one follow-up question originally. Thank you and sir your first question will come from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "Hi, good afternoon,", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Ben.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "I guess the first thing is maybe let's talk about where the market are at in the U.S and in Europe. The U.S basically, obviously you're continuing to struggle with generators. Tell us what you think underlying patient unit growth is, as well as and the second part of really is, what do you think is going to happen with these new products coming out and can you get back to a point where you're taking back share, even yet in the next couple of quarters?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Great question, so we think on a global basis that the market is growing at about a 15% or so rate and obviously we are out performing that on the international basis and we've had some challenges as you know on the U.S side, particularly in the flow generator side of the business. As far as visibility in the patient flow, that's always difficult one to say. I think this quarter was an unusual one, from the perspective that you had a lot going on in the market place. On one side you had home testing, NCD coming out, you had some fluctuations in the economy on the other side, and of course you had competitive bidding. So I think to a certain extent, we saw some impact on the HME side, as they just sort of took a little breather, and said let me just make sure, I understand what's going on here before I build too much inventor, on your question on products and actually very, very excited about the product flow that we have coming through. The... part of this success that we have seen in the international markets, is has been contributed not only by the mask product line which is really doing quite well in market places that historically has been more difficult to grow.", "But, also on the flow generator side where we have introduced the SA II products already with the Easy-Breathe technology, and so we're getting some really strong market feedback on that. That's very comforting. On the U.S side, as we look into this quarter, we've got two products that we will be introducing in that high-end, so we've got the APAP product and the Elite. We'll have the full quarter of the VPAP Auto which we didn't have during the last quarter. And we will be entering although, it'd be later in the quarter, so much less of an impact, but I think it's very important that we're entering the other lower segment with EPR. On escape platform, so I think that plugs a whole that we were clearly struggling with it a little bit, and I think and quite frankly, I think its going to be better for patients in the long run, because what it's doing is bringing down a compliance oriented type of feature set into that category.", "We had some real good competitive wins here recently that we haven't seen the impact fully of, we've had a strategy of trying to make sure that we participate in all segments of the market. We have seen a win here within the last couple of months, where we became the primary supplier to Praxair on a global basis, and for the first time in our history with Apria, we are going to be on a level playing field in their essential care model, and that's really the ink is just drying on that agreement at this point. But, so as we look forward, I think it's going to give us access both on a product and on a customer basis to some win that we didn't have here in the last few quarters. So, I am actually very optimistic about it.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Just a quick follow up, I mean pricing dynamics in the U.S stable, getting worse and that kind of roll off the impact later this year and then maybe Brett can follow up with what the currency impact could be for the balance of this year, rates stay the same? Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, alright great thanks for the question. So on the pricing, I would say the same thing, I did last quarter, which is that, we have not seen the floor that was established several quarters ago go any lower, which is good news and that's what we look for. So, if you go back three quarters, four quarters ago or so, when we started to see some of the significant price pressures and that's when we are talking about some deals that were quite challenging, we are not seeing prices go below that still. What does happen in this market place is that you see those early deals out of few customers and that rolls across the customer base.", "So basically this market is inefficient in the short-term and I mean it's efficient in the longer-term. So what that means is that we see the effect on average sale prices, sort of integrate over the series of quarter and I know we've still got several quarters and where that's sort of coming through on that curve. But what we look at is to see, was the floor established and we have been encouraged by what we have seen in the market place.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "Great and Brett.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes Ben, on the currency side, this quarter impact was a little bit viable for us because the euro was particularly strong and we did have some hedging gains this quarter. The... looking forward if you look at sort of currency rates, as they are... I mean it is hard to predict it, depends on the dynamics of the euro, versus the Aussie and so on, but with getting through sort of $0.01 positive, $0.01 negative, up to maybe $0.02 max. And I see that going forward, there could be a stage that have $0.01 detriment throughout Q4, but I don't say it's been particular significant and again it really does depend on how the currencies move. With the hedging in place and they are exposed, I don't think its going to impact significantly, but it can be $0.01 or $0.02 either side of EPS.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "But on the top line it would be another $10 million or $12 million a quarter, is that going to start to come back down, because the year-over-year rates getting a bit tighter?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, if you see U.S sort of... U.S, its 156-157 pretty high, so I would suspect that it will sort of come through roughly that sort of number again on the top-line?", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.", "Okay, great thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Ben.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Paul Choi with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, can you guys hear me?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, we can Paul. Thanks for your call.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, Okay great thanks. If you could may be start with home testing, now that you guys have had some time to review the... review the ruling, could you give us perhaps your sense of how the paradigm will evolve here, given some of the ambiguities in the documents and since that if a person does test, for instance, positive on a home test, how you see them ultimately getting on to a device, is it going back to overlap to be titrated with the confirmatory PSG and so forth, if you can walk through how you envision that process developing, and secondly how you see the DMEs and physicians, ultimately allocating the reimbursement for that. And if you can sort of give, how you envision that, perhaps a year or 18 months down the road? That would be great?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, okay, great. Lot of water has to flow under the bridge here. So what we're doing is we're listening to our customers. We're listening to the sleep community, we are listening to the HME community and we are seeing what... since they are the ones at the cold phase, we're seeing... what are you trying to do, how are you going to handle this, how are you in some cases lobbying, what do you think those success... success for that will be? So my guess is what's going to happen is it's going to be a number of business models. They are going to come out over the coming months that are going to try to influence speed and net outcome of this. Right, so we've got I think some of the leading sleep physicians who are trying to look at this on the on the hub and spoke model and they are saying you know what, this is a change that I can grow my business with and why I am going to use this is to augment the PSGs, and particularly the ones that are hybrids. They are both dispensing as well as doing diagnosis, you'll hear mixed reviews.", "Some of them want to bring people back in and do titration, other ones wants to keep the beds open so that they can use those for diagnosis of the more complex patients and use the home testing for the sample. So I think this is probably going to be both regionally and locally that in the next X number of months you are going to see people trying each of those and I think CMS is going to have to do what they are most comfortable with and what they feel provides the best care at the most economic level.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'd hate to try to guess what the government's going to doing. But I think that whichever way it leads to the right economics. I think we will be adopting quite frankly, from our perspective, anyway you look at that, we win and I think the patients win and I think that will be positive as we move forward. There are other players that are trying to play a role here... we hear window of HMEs trying to play roles of IDTF, so of other players and the healthcare community and they will all try to figure out if there is a role for themselves in that market place where they can in many cases take the technical component and provide the read fee or the professional fee to either the sleep physician or other sleep trained physicians in the process.", "So again, I think what you are probably going to see there is that the HMEs and some of these other players are going to try to partner with the sleep community or other parts of the healthcare community to try to figure out, how they can on one side minimize near-term channel conflict, while building relationships with their key referral sources. So, it's Paul its real mixed bag now, but I think that's going to be good. I think it's good because there is a lot of activity, there is a lot of interest. We are certainly getting a lot of queries about our ApneaLink with Oximetry, because it is a very simple device. It is highly accurate. Sleep physicians have been using it as part of their hub-and-spoke model now for several years and it is very well positioned to help them as they think through the model, that's going to best both for their own business, as well as for patient care. So water needs to flow under bridge, but I think it's all positive momentum.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Then a follow-up for Brett; if you don't mind, just on the investment write-down, can you comment on what it is specifically and what about change it from a temporary to a permanent impairment. And secondly, on the inventory side, it did step up I think you said a little over $3 million. How much of that is perhaps ApneaLink related or how much of it is intense anticipation of buildup for Medtrade here? And I will hop off, thanks.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. So on the write-down couple of that cost investments were the few trigger events that happened in the quarter on each of those. One of the entities did announce during the quarter, they had a significant goodwill write-down and it was significant, compared to the overall market cap of that company. So we took the view that after some significant write-downs and significant reduction in their share cost and this is in the slag in 10-Q over the last while is potential unrealized loss there. So in this quarter, we basically bit the bullet and write that down based on that trigger event, same with another, there was another small one in there as well in that, they have really decided to abandon the business model and looks like weren't going to get from that, so we also wrote that one-one off as well.", "So its couple of trigger events that moved it from temporary to what we thought was a permanent impairment. On the entry levels, aren't too bad, this combination is a little bit of some stocking to get ready for things like, it's like S8 II launch in the U.S for example, which is adding a little bit there. You do tend to get some currency impacting on that as well. If the U.S weakens against the Euro, obviously the euro, the European stockholdings would go up as well just on just on translation impact. So, it's a combination of level of items there.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks lot guys.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thanks Paul.", "Operator", "And gentlemen again next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess I was wondering given what happened with the home testing reimbursement. Do you think that there is possibility or is there anything in the works to get reimbursement coverage for the auto setting units?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, thanks for the question Mike. It's a good question. It's a hard one to predict. I can tell you that as soon as we saw the preliminary NCD, we did go back to the well; we did work with our Washington consultants and put together a modified version of what we had tried before on the auto setting because we think it's the right thing for the patients. We think it's the right thing for our homecare providers, and we think it's going to be the right thing overall for the sleep community to have appropriate reimbursement for these auto setting devices. So we are definitely taking a bite of that cherry. We think that the case makes sense, both economically and for patient care, but once again it's always so hard to predict, the way the government's going to move in, and I would be very hesitant to give you a specific prediction on that, but what I can tell you we're doing whatever we can support channel on that.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay, and your U.S business, this is... it slowed once again here. What's going on and, I mean do... when do you expect that to reaccelerate, and do you expect it to reaccelerate, I guess?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the answer is yes, we do. So let me reveal little bit about what we have been faced with. This quarter was a good example of where there is just a mixed bag we had some very positive results, some good indicators on the high-end product line. So VPAP Auto was very encouraging and only partial quarter impact was very encouraging. The movement towards additional use of auto setting devices which again is why we want to go back to that, that realm. We think it's appropriate for our HMEs to be appropriately compensated for that. But we're seeing even in advance to that we're seeing a higher movement towards, many of these auto setting devices. Where we struggled was in that lower-end, and really it has to do with not having expiratory pressure release in the lower-end devices.", "The market has clearly told us that they feel that that is a valuable feature set. It's when it sells well in the higher-end of our product range and they have told us that it is important they believe in the patient compliance and therefore, we need to have that in that range of products. That is exactly why we accelerated our product development cycle on that product and am actually very pleased with the efforts of the team, and most importantly the results of the team in being able to position that for a launch, later in this quarter.", "So I think that's going to be important. I also think on a mask side, the Mirage Micro is coming out exactly as we would hope it would. It's a great product and it compliments our product lines the Swift II and the Quattro. In the nasal pillows that Swift II we were holding a lions share of that market and we are going to shift away a little bit with some new interest. This Swift LT that will be coming out later in the quarter and will be there for everybody to see it Medtrade, it's just a fantastic product. It's both efficacious, it is very significantly differentiated from the Swift II, it takes the best parts of it and then it also gives it a different products forum and that's gives a people choice with an Nasal Pillow segment, they don't have to look outside of ResMed to get a choice of product forums. So that's positive.", "And I also think that looking at some of these customers wins that I was talking about, participating in some those segments, particularly some of the larger counts. I mentioned the win at Praxair, I mentioned the win for the level playing field that we now have at Apria that we hadn't enjoyed before. I think those are important aspects as we gain back our step here and I think also then on the back drop of that whole thing, because I think your question at the end it sounded even broader, will it come back? I think that the signals in this market place both on co-morbidities and the home testing are very, very good indicators for the long-term health of this industry. I remain very confident of that.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right, thanks Mike.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next quarter comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks David and welcome to the coverage.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Thank you. Hey, just, can you give us some update on competitive biding. What are your conversations with the DMEs going like and any additional color you can provide and how that's progressing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Sure. So with competitive bidding, they released the first 10 MSAs, the results of those first 10 MSAs, and as you know there is many, many MSAs throughout the United States. And with the feedback from HMEs, a couple of things, one is that in this market place only about 20% of the patients that are served our Medicare age. So it sort of dampens the effect to some extent, that being said it's certainly causing lot of conversations within the HMEs. We heard one large customer in the last couple of days in fact in your public comments was very vocal and what they are doing to try to communicate with CMS, their dissatisfaction with the process even though it's a customer, an HME that's well served by these types of decisions, because the business model supports it. The basic feeling of the HME community is that this not the best thing for patient care, and that they will very aggressively communicate that with examples back to CMS.", "So as we look forward, we certainly are the next 70 that are up for review here, and I think it's going to be interesting to see the impact that the HME community has on the rollout of this or changes to the rollout or lack of rollout. So I think there is still some smoke in that sector.", "Good news for us in this industry is it's about 20% of market; about 80% is still in private pay and the managed care side.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Do you expect any kind of impact once you it kind of gets up and running here, how are you kind of looking at possible price pressure from it, or anything along those lines?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, in these markets there is always price pressure. If we go back two or three years ago, the big talk was on Oxygen and MedNet cuts. Last year, we had some industry led challenges, this year we've got competitive bidding. In these kind of markets there is always pressure on making sure that you are providing technology at appropriate prices and the government is going to look very closely at those thing. The good new in those circumstances from my viewpoint is that the extent there pricing pressure and again it always is, you want to be the number or number two player, because the scale is important in reducing cost and being able to effectively serve the market place. So I have full expectations that whether it's competitive bidding or some other term in another year, we will still be talking about pricing and we will probably be talking about that adding some item, because its just the nature of any medical device business.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "And then just one follow up kind of the North American market. Do you, I mean do you think that this was kind of a little bit share loss or it's I mean how do you think overall North American market is growing. I know you said worldwide you still think 15% range, it's kind of what we should look forward, but do you think it's any kind of slowdown in bed growth or are they any kind macro factors that are kind of coming into play here.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so I think would you think any global basis. It was somewhere 15% growth and so we feel that really line we grew there. Certainly in the international markets, we feel that we're gaining share. And I'd have to say in the U.S. we on a global basis... on a macros basis, we lost share and I think that was predominantly the pressure that we saw in that low-end flow generator category, where we have yet to release the product with expiratory press release. And in the nasal pillow segment, we've seen some people trying to chip away at our very strong lead there in advance of us releasing new product series. So, I think it was a balance bag for us this quarter and it's one of the things that we are very pleased why we have international business on it. I think as for as bed growth, very hard to say, but I would be surprised if you are going to see substantial bed growth in the near term as people look at that home testing and look at there is a way that they can add capacity, now do I still hear about it? You bet, I mean I heard a group just two days ago, who announced, here in two that they were going to open up several beds. In San Diego they were going to open up several beds. And I know I heard news in different parts of the country. So, I think on the local, I will still see some bed growth. But I think many people are going to look at home testing and see how they can use that, shortly many of the sleep partners we are talking say how are they going to increase the capacity by leveraging home testing in some cost effective manner.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, thanks a lot guys.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "All right, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Alexander Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Hi guys, just question on home testing; if CMS... or autosetting devices don't get separate code. Does that home testing really worked then, because how patients going to get titrated in the absence of taking home those devices.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think, I think it still works either way to question is... is it as cost effective as it could be and this is probably also going to be a question, if it doesn't get adopted in the first six month, does it get adopted and second month or in the second year, because I think there is going... I find it hard to believe there is not going to be a lot of eyes that are around area and eyes that are looking for where they get benefit in the system... I think it's going to be...", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "If you don't get lot of setting code at home testing and it's really just another screening tool.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think, if you look at some players on the global community and even players in the U.S. community, we have seen where autosets use... are used in a pooled capacity, so sometimes even today, you may see sleep level do titration. They will titrate at a certain level and the DNA will still use an autotritrating device on a patient for two weeks, three weeks, a month, and they will basically use it as titration checker if you will, all right? And then once thing they get that, let's say 95 percentile on our machine, then they still issue a CPAP, but they will do it at a... that they'll do it at a... the pressure that they validated, the pressure that was titrated in a lab. So, there is multiple models that are already in existence and can be viewed. I think what's going to... certainly... by getting the code, what it does is, it narrows the gap for the HME and it just... it is further inducement... further encouragement not to remove the autoset from patient and do a switch over because that cost them money, its time and its risk, anytime you change some of this therapy, if there has been compliance, you are introducing a risk that inevitably is going to cost them more money.", "So I think what's going to happen is different people are going to experiment just as they already have and have for a number of years, I think it's going to experiment with different process flow. And I think the big determinant of whether they get paid for not maybe the percentage that keep on autoset as opposed to whether they do it at all or not. Does that make sense?", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Yes.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Thanks for that guys.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Gross margin, seem to be hovering around the 60% range. How much of that is being negatively impacted by foreign exchange and how should we think about that guidance forward?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So why don't I push that question over to Brett?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes; thanks, Kieran. So... yes, Joanne on the margin there is kind of two factors working at that, the stronger euro is benefiting the margin and obviously the stronger of the... against the euro is detrimental to it. If you look at in combination, it's pretty much a wash at the moment on the margin line. So, really because the euro, it's tending to offset the dollar impact there.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And looking forward, I mean are we thinking 60% of the floor on this?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I mean if you look forward, there is... I don't know what's out there. We think around 60% is probably the number obviously there is a lot of impact on that, you'll continue to see pricing pressures and that has been the negative on the margin for a reasonable period of time. But we have had offset in that for example in geographic mix, where international sales have been pretty strong. So, that helps the margin. Product mix also helps. If mask growth is much stronger than flow generator growth, for example that we are experiencing at the moment that would help the margin, clearly when flow generator growth will accelerate that will then tend to put pressure on the margin. So, it's a matter of lying all those up and we are looking in the crystal ball, but there is the factors that have an impact on us and then you really need to make a call on where you think they're heading going forward.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, the other aspect is that we've had a very aggressive global supply chain team, particularly on the vendor alliance side, which has been, I think just doing a bang-up job, working with our vendors to reduce supply chain cost, which have been a benefiting near term. I think we are going to see that as we move forward. So we are very actively working throughout the organization in order to maintain margins.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Have you seen any changes in the broader market now that Respironics is part of Philips?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good question, we don't see a lot yet. We remain very positive about fill ups entry in this marketplace. One of the things that are... couple of things we're encouraged about our Philips is knows more to compete through innovations or known more to compete through market expansion. And historically of course that's exactly, where we like to focus and I think that that's good for the long-term health of the industry. Because we all need to be focused on expansion of the market, reaching more patients and we've long known that when we've been the guy doing the heavy lifting that the fast follower strategy of our competitor was a good strategy for them. And I think we are very much looking forward to the awareness that could be built through Philips and their activities in the global basis as well as a focus on innovation. So, no significant near term impact and we still remain positive that it's going to be a good positive long-term impact.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. My final question has to do with the domestic sleep therapy number, hate to harp on this one. But it seems as if it is the low product or low feature product that really ships you up this quarter. And I am curious why the Tango didn't fit that need.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, So, it was two areas, right? So, you are absolutely right. On the flow generator side, it was that lower category. And the issue has to do with that feature set of expiratory press release. The Tango is actually doing its job in sort of that blocking strategy in the low end used where all that is required is a very, very basic machine. So, it's doing it's in that category. What we have seen is that as the expiratory pressure relief type of feature set has moved into the lower end of the instrument side that a lot of volume has moved in that direction and just we've been very frank that we've been hurt on that side by not having a product that has a feature set, and that's exactly why we accelerated the development of the product that we will be able to release later in this quarter.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for the questions.", "Operator", "And gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", ": Hi, this is Jamar [ph] for Jason?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Jamar.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The question I have is on the higher reimbursement for APAP, is there anything anecdotally you could give us from your feedback about the process is going on now and is the timeline still at the first cut towards the end of this month.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am sorry, Jamar; I missed the beginning part of your question. Can you repeat that?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Could you just give us any color or any anecdotal evidence you have from the process going on or what the status is?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "On the APAP coding?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I am sorry; I missed the beginning part of your question. So on the APAP coding, there is really not a lot of color to provide. We submitted a recommendation, I think Dave Pendarvis is on the line now and may want to jump and can give color detail. We've submitted a proposal that we believe should... we thought it was a well written proposal that supported the channel and was sufficient information to say that is both better for patient care and better for the economics of the channel in order to support the use of AutoSet. My understand is that by the end of May or June, we should get some preliminary indications back from CMS and that following that there will be a common period and then the final ruling will fall from that. So, my expectation is within the next several months, we'll get an indication about which way it's going to go although there will be no final decision. Dave, you have anything else there or that?", "David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General", "No, Kieran; this is Dave. I think you got it right. The timeline is that it should be towards the end of May of that there is public hearing on the matter you typically get a preliminary decision from CMS in advance of that, but then as you indicated there is a period after that and the final decision may not come out until later this year, perhaps late as November of 2009... I am sorry, 2008. If there is a code granted, it wouldn't go into effect until January of 2009. And you really don't get much in the way of anecdotal indications from CMS in advance; obviously, we'll get something in advance, we expect. And then you'd have whatever readings of the tea leaves you can get from the public hearing sort of the end of May, but then you don't get the final decision until later in the year. So, we remain optimistic as Kieran said earlier in the call. It's always hazardous to try to predict what the government is going to do, but we do believe that the use of AutoSet devices, particularly in late of home testing and use for auto titration makes sense for... payers make sense for patients and makes sense for our customers, and we are hopeful that the CMS will see it that way.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks. Moving to home sleep testing, have we seen any local coverage decisions yet, and are they so they're following the NCE.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so the water is still flowing under the bridge on that one. We're still waiting to hear the various LCDs and that's going to translate into daily coverage and how it's going to impact the market and all. So, still bit of water to going to the bridge on that. Again, Dave you have any comments?", "David Pendarvis - Sr. Vice President, Organizational Development and General", "No, I think our expectation is that, it will flow through along the lines of the original CMS decision and that the private carriers will fall in line, again it makes fundamentals sense to allow home testing as an adjunct to polysomnography. That way to positions going to make the choice, whatever they think is right and the patients will be allowed to take whatever they think is appropriate. This is to make fundamental sense we expect go forward along that line, but it takes some time to play out.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks so much. [ph]", "Operator", "And gentlemen the next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please proceed.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hey guys, congrats on a great quarter and thanks again for taking my question here. Most of my questions have been answered, just some clarification; I know Kieran you mentioned the S8 II Escape with Easy-Breathe at the... sort of low end to get EPR there. I assume that would be part of the full launch with other assay, or should we... the way to think about it is that would be the first one to come out and then sort of the higher end models coming out in quarters to follow.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Actually, it's actually the opposite; so we are actually right now in the midst of launching the S8 II Vantage and S8 II Elite, and these are the products that we had launched or derivatives of those products that we had launched in other parts of the globe already, so that's what we going to see, when you go to Medtrade, and that's what our sales force has in its bag to sell. The Escape with EPR is not out towards until the end of the quarter and that's the rollout that we expect on the CPAP range of our products.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Okay. So the ones that are out are the APAPs right now? The S8 II Vantage and S8 II Elite are both auto devices, no?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes,so the...you're... absolutely, the Vantage is an auto device absolutely. The Elite is actually a CPAP device that has expiratory pressure relief. That also has the data and efficacy gathering capabilities. So think of it as a data reach CPAP and our APAP. That's our high-end product line. They are both launching with S8 II and the Easy-Breathe technology as we speak. And the EPR, which is a little less feature rich on the data side of the equation will have and it's also less costly is the device that will now have expiratory pressure relief, and that comes out at the end of the quarter.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Okay. And then just along the lines of... I am glad you brought up the data rich device. It's clear that along with the changes here in Medicare that monitoring a patients needs to be stepped up a bit and obviously with your devices having certain advantages over especially low end ones, have you seen a pick up or a higher level of interest in sort of devices that can offer more data?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's a great question, and we actually have seen... in our product line, we have seen growth in the high end category. If you aggregate our high-end devices, and that's even taking VPAP auto for the sites, so we are just saying the CPAP, APAP side, we have seen that higher end category grow. Now, whether or not it's growing also in the low end, again we are more in a competitive challenge position, and that's we will find out once we launch the Escape with EPR. So, that's a balanced question, but we are definitely seeing a pick up in those higher-end machines.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Okay. And then just along the line of launch, I am sure obviously people are going to look at the U.S. generator number, I expect good things from the new launch. I am sure you do too or you said. But is there are any sense that why were sales person I knew I had a launch coming up of new products especially the newest ones, latest and greatest et cetera; is there any sense that part of the weakness might have been sort of some waiting for the next one?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it's a great question. There is a lot of psychologies that happened at the field level. I have a lot of confidence in our sales reps. I think they are very mature organization and they know that they need to sell what they've got. That being said, is it possible there might have been a little bit of hold of there is a possibility. Was it material, I have nothing that would indicate approve that it was material or not material. I can tell you on the opposite side now that we are providing their bag, these guys are extremely excited. The ability particularly with that Easy-breathe technology, they were able to warm up to it with the VPAP auto. They had a couple of months of selling it. We didn't see the full quarter impact, we had a couple of months, and so they are able to get out to customers; and in essence trial, how are they going to respond to this low noise positioning. How they're going to respond and they've responded extremely well. And of course the customers' first question was always, so tell me, when is this going to come out in CPAP range? You're going to put this in the CPAP range. And so their ability to have a second act only a few months later and be able to put it in the Vantage and put it in the Elite has really got the Sales force energized. In addition to knowing that they have got this Swift LP coming down the line and a recently introduced Mirage Micro. It's been a great psychological booster for us.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. And then just as I always ask, any update on the Sam there?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "On Sam? Oh yes, so the ventilation product range continues to grow. I have been very pleased with the operational efficiency improvement that we've seen in that what we call our Paris range of products. Several of products remain manufactured in Paris itself; we've moved several other of those products over to Sydney. So, it is being received well. We are anticipating though is a series of update for those products, which will be coming out later next year. So, we are not announcing any dates on that et cetera. But we moved the team from simply getting the efficiencies in place and solving some of the... sort of the normal deficit engineering you see in companies when you buy in their early stage. And now they are able to focus to full time attention at the new generations. So, we've got really well energized and quite frankly a well lead team over there.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great, thanks for taking my questions guys.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet; thanks, Joshua.", "Operator", "And gentlemen at this time, this will conclude the allotted time slot for the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to management for any closing comments.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you very much. I appreciate everybody's time and attention. I think this was a great quarter for ResMed. It was a quarter that demonstrated and I think reinforced our strategy of internationalization, and we've got a lot of exciting things coming up. So, I look forward to updating you on future quarters. Thanks again for your questions and your interest.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participation in today's conference.

My name is Marsha, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as, projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new market for the company products.", "These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Marsha. Well welcome everybody to ResMed's Q4 2008 results call. I am very pleased, very optimistic about our performance and about the recent industry developments. And I look forward to reviewing those with you today.", "So we set new records for performance and results during the quarter and I will open the call up by making some introductory comments, then I'm going to turn the call over Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer to go through the financials in a bit more detail. And then it will come back to me for... me and the team actually for your questions.", "Well we finished 2008 on a high note. Global revenue was 23% in the fourth quarter coming in at a record $235 million. As we continue our focus strategy of launching new and innovative technologies into the global marketplace.", "In particular I was very pleased to note that the growth was stimulated by regions across the globe. Every region for ResMed played a critical role and contributed to our success. It's also important to mention that the company generated a record $56.8 million in operating cash flow during the current year... quarter. And that was driven by solid working capital management and operating performance. And we put those funds to good used by repurchasing almost $52 million of company's stock during the fourth quarter.", "The outside U.S. business continues to fire on all cylinders posting a 32% growth in revenue. France and Germany were the main drivers in Europe and we expect to see continued success on the leadership of Lasse Beijer and his team in fiscal year '09.", "We're also very pleased to see the American's region return to mid-teens growth with a 14% increase in revenue year-over-year. We launched the number of new products in Americas in Q4 and a feedback on those products has been absolutely phenomenal.", "The flow generator segments grew 17% worldwide and we're pleased to see how the U.S. flow generators segment return to growth in the high single-digits due to the introduction of the S8 II platform with our innovative Easy-Breathe technology.", "In particularly the high-end or auto in the lead products performed exceptionally well with AutoSet leading the way as the fastest growing flow generator in category from a percentage terms.", "NASS segment, posted another banner quarter with 29% global growth, due to new product introductions led by the new smaller low noise nasal pillows products with Swift LT. This product has been received exceptionally well in the marketplace.", "We believe the new products have much more to run and we're confidence that continued innovation in NASS Technologies will bring additional growth as we launched several new products in fiscal year '09.", "For the year ended June 30, the company grew revenues 17% to $835.4 million while generating a record $143 million in operating income and $110.3 million in net income.", "We ended the year with an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We had $321 million in cash and we demonstrated our confidence in this industry and in our company by repurchasing $2.6 million shares this fiscal year, representing a total investment at share repurchase of nearly $100 million.", "As we entered at fiscal '09 I think it's useful to step back and reflect a bit on the industries prospects for growth. In summary, this industry has never been poised more for expansion of a growth. We need only to look the developments within the past few months to demonstrate that this under penetrated market remains robust and remains one of the most attractive segments in the medical device industry.", "For example, home testing; it's been early encouraging signals related to home sleep testing. Approvals from private insurers like Anthem the largest insurer the U.S. will help open up the diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing to many more patients. I personally believe that as we look back on home sleep testing, we'll look at this as a single biggest inflexion point in this industry's future.", "Competitive bidding was delayed for 12 to 18 months providing some certainty to the HME's so they can plan their expansion strategies. We formed to join marketing agreement with Johnson & Johnson LifeScan Division, the largest provider of glucose meters in the Americas to promote awareness and education of sleep disorder breathing in the diabetic population.", "New clinical literature and medical guidelines including the International Diabetes Federation statement on sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes were released. And a review article in the ACC, AHA on sleep disorder breathing and cardiovascular disease which was published in circulation and jacked just a few weeks ago.", "In fact just last week, MSMBC picked up an update from Dr. Terry Young's latest data, which showed a six-fold increase in the risk of death for severe sleep disorder breathing patients. We are clearly serving a population of patient that need our help and that are costing the healthcare systems around the globe billions of dollars. And we are doing it with a therapy that is incredibly safe. Safer than an Aspirin and yet is in incredibly efficacious.", "In summary, we just completed a record breaking quarter for ResMed. We experienced growth throughout the globe. We rebounded in the Americas, we have a series of new products that are either in the launch process or soon to be there. We generated a record breaking $56.8 million in cash during the quarter and we are confident about our ability to grow the market in the short and the long-term and about out opportunity to grow shareholder value throughout fiscal year '09.", "Now over to Brett and then back to your questions. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Kieran. I'll briefly run through the June quarter results.", "Our revenues for June quarter was a record $235.2 million, a 23% increase over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $14.1 million to our Q4 revenues. Our income from operations of $37 million for the quarter and net income for the quarter was $29.6 million.", "During the quarter we recognized an additional charge of $3.1 million for asset recall, staying at throughout of our original accrual and reflecting more thoroughly on actual cost incurred as we approach the conclusion of the recall.", "We do not anticipate any meaningful incremental expenses associated with recall in fiscal year 2009. Excluding recall expenses and amortization requiring tangibles our income from operations was $42.2 million and net income for the quarter was $33.2 million. While diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42, an increase of 14% over to prior year comparable quarter.", "Our gross margin for the quarter was 58.3%, down sequentially from Q3 reflecting product mix changes, foreign currency movements and ISP declines. The product mix impact was attributable to the strong recovery in flow generated sales in the U.S. this quarter. While the strength of Australian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our gross margins.", "However, I would note that recently the Australian dollar has declined from its high than any sustained decline in the Ausi dollar will be positive for the gross margins.", "Additionally and importantly, we expect initiatives currently in progress in areas such as supply chain, manufacturing and product development to have a positive impact on margins as we look forward.", "SG&A for the quarter was $77.4 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A increased by more modest 10% over the prior year quarter. SG&A substantial revenue improved to 33%, compared for a year ago figure of 34%.", "R&D expense for the quarter was $17.6 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter and again in constant currency terms R&D increased by 9% over the prior year quarter. R&D as percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the year ago figure.", "With our ongoing commitment to innovation, solid product pipeline and clinical trial activity, we expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to continuing in the 7% range for the fiscal year 2009.", "Amortization of the acquired intangibles was $2.1 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.3 million.", "Turning to revenues in more detail. Overall Americas sales were $112.2 million, an increase of 14% over the prior quarter. So, outside Americas probably $123 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenues between product segments. In the Americas, flow generators increased by 8% over the prior year quarter, well Masks and other increased by 18%. The growth reflects the continuation of strong sales in our new product introductions, including encoring traction from recently introduce, S8 II flow generator.", "For revenues outside the U.S., flow generators increased by 24% while Masks and other increased by 49%. Again driven by strong new product sales across key international geographic markets. On a group basis flow generator sales increased by 17% while Masks and other increased by 29%.", "Cash flow from operations as Kieran had mentioned was a record $56.8 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital management.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.2 million and these included $7.8 million in building construction cost, predominantly associated with the constructions of our new headquarters in San Diego.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $16.5 million. We continued to buyback shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.4 million shares for consideration of $61.7 million as part of our ongoing buyback program.", "For fiscal year 2008, we have repurchased $2.6 million shares or approximately 3% of shares outstanding. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares out of the total approved buyback of 8 million shares.", "We ended the fiscal year financial in very good shape. Our balance sheet remains strong, with total asset of $1.4 billion and net equity $1.1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents net of external debt were $183 million at the end of June.", "I'll now hand the call back to Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Brett. Well with that why don't we open up the line for some questions?", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall [UBS Securities]. Please proceed.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Good morning guys. Thanks very much and very good results. Perhaps if I can just ask a couple of housekeeping questions, just I guess on FX, total FX impacting perhaps just give a sense of what plan through from you're the stronger account you got there but also in terms of cost as well?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Yes thanks for the question Andrew. And Brett you want to take the FX, please?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Andrew if you looking at that on total net basis including some of the foreign currency hedging gains we've made this quarter which around $1.2 million, you probably... if you look through on EPS its $0.01 to $0.02 actually positive impact year-on-year from currencies.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "And perhaps could you sell through... I just presumably the euro was obviously contributing quite strongly top-line?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct. So the euro... they're troubling on their revenues obviously there was $14 million or touch over and the euro has contributed obviously offset largely by the increase or appreciation the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Okay. And you're saying that net is about 1.2?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, $0.01 to $0.02, including the hedging gains for this quarter.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Okay good. And perhaps just drilling down to the performance just perhaps if you could... maybe just expand here a little bit more on, what's the contribution in new products has been and perhaps maybe Kieran if you could just give on what driving and have a result or the having surcharge this quarter?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, absolutely. It was a great product or I should a great quarter for wins across the board from new products to new customers vendors or penetration within current accounts. So, during the third quarter we had launched the VPAP Auto and the Mirage Micro. So we have full quarter in the fourth quarter.", "And then during this past quarter we launched the S8 II Auto and the S8 II Elite, part of the way through the quarter in the U.S and then very late in the quarter we launched the S8 II Escape. And then of course in the math side the Swift LT. The products have been received exceptional well.", "I guess, tell you this Easy-Breathe Technology that is the under pinning of the new VPAP products as well as the S8 II series. And importantly, just remind ourselves, this Easy-Breathe Technology is a motor technology where it's a double ended blower. It's incredibly efficient, it allows for massive sound reduction. I mean some of the new buy levels we're going to launching are 90% quieter than the competitive alternative. And yet they are more responsive than any other motor on the marketplace.", "So what you have is, benefit from noise allowing you to reduce the size of the instruments. But also improved performance, all of which yield benefits on the compliance side and that that's where we're trying to drive compliance, because flow generators lead to complaint patients, which means they use more Masks which there would be the highest profitability segment we have overtime.", "So it's a very sort of good trend that we see from that perspective. So as far as this quarter, the S8 II Elite and Auto contributed well. We saw particularly in the AutoSet side of the business in the Americas that whether it's a consequence of home sleep testing or other develops in the market, we just saw a very, very significant up-tick on those types of products. We really haven't seen the impact yet of the Escape too, that would probably come in this year or I should say this quarter.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Because it was launched late in the quarter. And the Swift LT came out like a shot. I mean it is a really differentiated product, smaller, it's quieter. We've got part of a quarter impact on that, probably about two thirds of the quarter. So... and we're looking forward to that rolling out through the rest of the part of year.", "So from a product perspective, what we've launched has been received very well in the marketplace. And by the way we've got a couple of new products that are launching as I speak in the bilevel category. And we've got some new Mask in the pipeline throughout this year. So very good from a product perspective.", "From a customer perspective, we've continued on wins. We made progress at the large accounts, obviously, I am not going drill too much in the detail on any given customer in respect for their privacy. But we have done well with some of these new competitive wins and I... we quite frankly haven't gotten all that I expect to get from it. So we're still in the early cycle, I'd say on some of these competitive wins and gaining share and I expect continue to do so throughout the year.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Okay. Perhaps we out missing the line, any particular customers move that material... was it material to this result?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "One of us is being breaking. So I couldn't really understand you. Could you say that Andrew?", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "I am sorry. Sorry, was it Aprea material to this result?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So Aprea has always been a large account for us. And obviously, it's going to get, we believe it's gone get larger and it has been getting larger, given that we're now playing on a level playing field. I am not going to speak directly to the numbers other than to say there was increase that was due to them. But it was certainly not the majority of the increase that we experienced. We had experienced and wins across the board at multiple accounts and in the accounts that we're in because of the products that we released.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Okay. So that's probably fair to say that it will soon ramp up?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities", "Yes, I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills. Please proceed.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Thanks, Kieran. Congrats on a good quarter.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "So, U.S. business bounced back perhaps a little bit better and sooner than we expected and perhaps you could comment to Andrew's question following on as to really how much impact we saw in the quarter from sort of unit growth in the U.S. relative to what pricing did?", "And then I was curious, with respect to the gross margins, clearly we all sit in the room here when I talked investors as where gross margins are going to do, so I would like to understand better how currency impacted gross margins specifically? And what otherwise is a great quarter across the board. We saw gross margins come down a little bit and I feel like some of the really great things in the quarter could get lost unless we understand sort of where that could drop going forward and if in fact Kieran, we could start to see that with a little bit more of a stable currency tick back up sequentially here in the first quarter of fiscal 2009?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, great, great question Jason. Look, we had the results that you saw that come of out of the Americas, we were very pleased with we are very proud of that it came back very strongly. And the answer is across it was across the board. That was driven by new products, it was driven by execution, it was driven by new customer win.", "So, there were a number of factors that came into play, all of which were very important. But let me just see at the specifically the gross margin question. So yes, we did see a tick down to 58.3% and I think there is a number of things that you want to keep in mind with that. For those of you who've been following ResMed for number of years which you've seen is that we normally take a tick down in Q4, it's sort of a historical trend that we've normally experienced during the fourth quarter.", "And as you know, Americas came back strong, very strong. We jumped from up to 14% growth from where were at which is 5% in the prior quarter and our flow generators went to from negative 5% all the way up to plus 8% on the back of some fantastic product releases.", "And in addition to the currency, and the currency did absolutely play a role in it. We've long known the geographic mix in the U.S. and product mix the flow generators had some impact on the gross margin percent. I mean it's very good for cash flow, it's very good for gross margin dollars and it puts a little bit of pressure on the percentage, the gross margin percentage.", "But if I drill down that a little bit more, lets talk about what we're doing about margin expansion as we're moving forward. What are we doing from the fundamentals, not only for this continued growth that we've seen, but also to look at the margin line. And there is a couple of different things that we're engaged in right now that I think are going to start paying dividends. So let's go through them.", "One is the pricing, alright. So we feel the product pricing has stabilized. We made some adjustments over the past couple of quarters to get us back in line with market pricing and we now feel that we're price correctly for the market. Approx we have a seller year of product launch ahead of us. And importantly a number the products that we have that are on the launch cycle yield strong margins and that's not an accident. Several years ago, we substantially increased our R&D focus on products such as Masks and such as Bilevel and we're just now in the middle for instances of those Bilevel launches that I mentioned before the VPAP SC and VPAP Auto 25.", "Both of them use this Easy-Breathe technology, up there are 90% quieter and the competitive alternative, there are in the smaller box and they've got ResMed quality. We've got the Swift LT rollout which we only saw a partial quarter, last quarter, we're going to see a full quarter of this quarter and as we move forward. And I got to tell we've got a year that we're going to be rolling out additional Masks throughout the year. So between the Bilevel in the Mask, we've got a good product flow ahead of us. Alright?", "Supply chain, alright? So this is our third area that we're focused on. We are actively engaged in this for margin expansion in the supply chain leveraging the volume growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. As we grow volume we grow opportunity. And what we've done is we've gone outside the company, we've looked to... in fact we've gone outside the industry, we looked to the automotive industry and said, hey, how can we do things better? We've hired in some of that talent, we're actively engaged in it now and I fully expect that to be showing dividends.", "And finally manufacturers, now in addition to our very strong comfortable presence in Australia we're gone be adding capacity in a lower cost region. Where we can still maintain our high expectations for quality, we will not drop on quality sides. But we do see opportunities for augmenting our current manufacturing strategy with lower cost locations. Alright? And we expect to be doing that in the coming six months or so.", "So in summary, totally agree with you I think ForEx absolutely have some impact on it. We have natural sort of cycle in Q4 as well and we had very result in the Americas and as I look forward be it from the supply chain, be it from product introduction that we're in the mid to rolling out, be it a stabilization in market pricing to the manufacturing I see very good opportunities on the margin side as we look forward.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Thanks Kieran, that was very, very robust and very helpful it sound like you --", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason you're going to get me in trouble being provoked.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Well, it was quite good. Lets put it that way. And if you were obviously well prepared for that question expecting perhaps to receive a question about gross margins. So you maybe perhaps... hopefully you would answer this question which would be, could you give us some comfort that you... ResMed may show us sequentially up gross margins assuming we are at sort of the currency levels that we saw exceeding the quarter.", "Can you at least go that far as to say that this could be as we look two quarters back... two quarter ahead looking back the top in gross margins given all that you said about the improvement you expect to make in those four or five areas?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jasonlook I would never get into that shorter term of discussion when it comes to the complexities of geographic mix and product mix and everything else. So we have always stayed away from very short term discussions on gross margins, I am not... continue to stay away from that, but I will reiterate that we feel very comfortable with the action plan ahead of us and we do feel very comfortable with everything from product introductions schedules to lay down through the market situation on pricing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay so, but generally over this, over a longer period of time, you would be, you would expect to see gross margins at a higher levels sort over a longer period of time than where you exited 2008 fiscal year.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely, we are really [ph] targeted on that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and last question, I'll get back in queue, as it relates to the Americas region, your flow generator sales certainly improved dramatically, but is lower than where I think market growth is did generally. Would you expect a launch... full launch of the escape here this quarter to have an impact on taking your flow generator sales sort of back in to that low to mid teens level like you showed for the total Americas business this quarter.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we're feeling very good, where we are in our product cycle, where the S8 2 has a very good contributor. Let's not forget outside the U.S. and the growth that we've seen over the last several quarters, not only from execution, but also because we launched product like the S8 II earlier outside the U.S. and we have seen same growth from that. I fully expect that that the Escape II will be receive well in the marketplace. It already has been received well in it's early days. I fully expect that the bilevels that we launching over the course of this quarter will be received well in the marketplace. So I think that we're in a good place in our product launch side.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much, Kieran great quarter.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line... one moment. Your next question comes from the line of David Clair. Please proceed.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Hey, guys. Can you hear me?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We can, David.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, well first of all congratulations on a great quarter. Well, it's very impressive results. I just was wondering if you could may be discuss the pipeline that you had, it sounds like fiscal '09, it's going to be pretty good year from a product launch perspective, I mean. What should we be looking for and is it more kind of a back half '09 waiting or is it a kind study throughout the year.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We've got various products that are launching throughout the year. I'll talk specifically with the products we're midst of launching now. And for competitive reasons, I'll stay away specifics on some of the other products and very specific timing. But, we are, you think about this quarter, it looks to be the first quarter that we will have full Swift LT, full S7 Elite, full S8 Auto, full S8 II in the Americas. And we've got the bilevel side, we have the VPAP FT and the VPAP Auto 25, both are literally in the midst of launching as we speak now. So I think that product lineup is a very exciting product lineup from the flow generator side, as well as with the Swift LT.", "From the mass perspective, you can expect several mass that will come out at various times throughout the year. So it's not all loaded to one part of the year or the other. So I think it's a good mix bag right across the product line.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. And, if we could just talk, you actually kind of hit this a little bit earlier but you said that you think that pricing has stabilized at this point, I mean what's kind of your estimate of price pressure in the quarter in North America, I mean is it still a low single-digits that we are looking at or if you could just talk about it real quick, that will be great.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "I think when you look at a lot of the genesis of some of the price movements, it really is about a year ago or so that may be, actually little bit more than that, probably 15 months ago or so that this started and of course, our believe as market leaders is that we should be slow to respond on the pricing side. We would like to maintain a premium pricing strategy, we think it's healthy for the industry over the long haul. And we think we deserve it, because were believe we have the best technologies and there the most efficacious for patients and the best of customers, form a quality perspective. What we have seen is last couple of quarters that we need to adjust some pricing to get back in line with market pricing, we made those adjustments.. We have not seen significant movement at all from a competition since field just come in from the marketplace and acquired. And we are very hopeful that discipline will maintain going forward, and I think we have a couple of large competitors that are quite reasonable that compete on quality, that compete on innovation, that compete on market growth. And that's certainly where we're focused and we feel that right now we've made the adjustments for the necessary.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, well thanks a lot. Thanks again and great quarter.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable. You may proceed.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hey, guys congratulations on the great quarter here.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Joshua.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Thanks for taking my questions. I'll be quick I'm sure there is a long line but Kieran just talking about U.S. market growth I know you talked about pricing being stable. Can you just sort of obviously there is some push back about people talk about the law of numbers in this market and I know you talked about the positive dynamics out there whether be no, co-mobility or what not. Obviously there is been some confusion in the marketplace over the past year. Can you just give us some sort of sense of volumes if you can believe sort of volumes out there are healthy? Right now we're going forward kind what you're seeing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we seen a lot of good signals I think for market expansion over the last three months, six months I think that something comes up, either in clinical side from the awareness side et cetera that should be very positive in the long-term growth in the market. We've long said this market should be round at 10% to 15% ex-U.S. in the U.S. 15% to 20% to sort of blending around that 15%. And our feeling has been that is a sustainable figure, different drivers over different times. But it's a sustainable figure and our objective is always been to grow at and above market rate. The... if you look at where the markets growing now in the Americas previous question, I think we're about that market growth, I think the revenue growth rate is probably around that 13%, 14% or so volume growth is probably a few points above that probably around lets call 16% or so, so it remains a good robust marketplace.", "When you look at some of the drivers that have come out recently, they both well for the future and they both well for recognition that this market remains hugely, hugely under-penetrated. So let's just get a few examples, International Diabetes Federation statement. I don't think there is enough time and attention that is paid or understood about this because this is where you had leaders in the diabetes community coming together with terminologists or erotologists coming together with cardiologists.", "Looking at the clinical literature and saying there is absolutely a huge overlap between these orders, I mean some of the figures are up to 70% of diabetics have the disorder and it appears that we're not appears, the data shows that the primary issue the diabetic suffer from that they die from cardiovascular complications or exactly where the treatments sleep disorder breathing can support, can help, that means lowering of blood pressure, the treatment being used in heart failures, this is we're doing in our clinical study within Europe with survey chest, these things all tied together and say that is good medical practice and this is what the recommendation was it is good medical practice for type to diabetics to be squeal for sleep disorder breathe, that's never happened before this opens up a massive market opportunities in front of us, to bring people into the pipeline.", "There were just with view article and that was a co published in circulation inject, looking at the vast amount of clinical literature on cardiovascular disease and sleep disorder breathing now these things move to held stand accord. A very young stated that was again picked by MSMBC showing a sixth fold increase in risk, immortality if you got severe sleep disorder breathing, this is a massive issue that is costing healthcare systems around the globe billion of dollars and it remains under penetrated.", "Even it the home sleep testing like with all these different pieces that move with home sleep testing during the quarter. There is no way to look at home sleep testing other than say positive, positive, positive because anyway you look at it, it opens up the doors to more people being diagnose to simplifying the diagnostic process. Right, it is a positive step forward for this industry and will continue to be as we move forward.", "So we remain very, very optimistic about it. I think all these things when if that having multiple shots on goal right, not all of them have to hit all at once, each one can hit overtime and that's what feeds into this continued regular growth that we seen in the industry, this would happen in the past and it goes very well for what we believe is going to happen in the future.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Okay. And then, I mean you touched upon that was sort of my follow up, just at home diagnostics, I mean a lot of people have sort of looked at these LCD's as a negative. I totally agree with you that having home testing is obviously better than not having it, anywhere you cut it, but you made a point to say that you seem to see them... see it in the market already as having some sort of impact, given that may be it's, Medicare is obviously a small part of it, so that's why the LCD's don't really matter or may be can you just kind of talk a little bit, I know it's early and I know LCDs kind of just came out, but sort of a what you are seeing on a home testing, I know you have alluded that fact that's helping, but can you just add a little bit more color there on the specifics?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, sure. I mean we negative a good point, Joshua which is which is always important for us to remind ourselves that in Americas, the Medicare population is only 20% of the population being addressed. That being said, I was very encouraged to see that and some right sort of country's largest insurers [ph] jumped on Board with home sleep testing. Of course, there is a lot of movement in the early days with the LCDs. Even if these things are coming out, some of them still point back to the old national coverage decision, right? I mean, for this... where we get these government bureaucracies, there is always a little bit of confusion in the early days. There is a little bit of too and fro.", "But anyway you look at it, what is it's doing, it's validating that home sleep testing is a valid way in addition to PSG and in addition, and in combination with the sleep test because we still remain firmly partnered with the sleep community and we see some very innovative sleep physicians who are at beginning of the early days of home sleep testing, where they are reaching out to some other physicians in their community, some of them are CMS related, many of them quite frankly are more private payroll oriented and saying, hey, can we increase the diagnostic capacity.", "So, look, I think early days on these changes are always a little bit balancing. The think is to take the step back, look at it and say is the ball moving down the court or not and the answer is firmly, yes. The ball is moving firmly down the court and we believe it's going to continue to move that way.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great, well interesting. Congrats and thanks again guys.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great, thanks Joshua.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew from William Blair. You may proceed.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up, I am sorry Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I said hey Ben.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Hey, I was trying to follow-up with a couple of things about sort kind of tying into things. The DME activity, are you seeing any shift in behavior, versus in the last six months as a result of some resolution on the local coverage decisions or the home testing, etcetera that are moving the needle here, because I think you're talked about volume growth picking up a bit.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, right. In some ways it's a little hard to segment out, because at the same time all these changes we are occurring, we're launching the S8 II platform with Easy-Breath. And so we have seen a very significant up-tick, particularly again in the auto setting part of that business. Part of that is clearly attributable to people preparing themselves for home sleep testing that's part of feedback that we get. And part of that is clearly attributable to the fact that were, we are gaining share in that category. So I think --", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Can you tell what's what or you just can't?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "I think it will be really hard for us to guesstimate at that.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, but clearly there's been a significant shift in your volumes?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "There's clearly been a... we are growing clearly growing more quickly at that high end and that leads to mix shift, yes.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, are you seeing growth in the low end of the product line, is that stabilizing where units are back up and even lower mid-single digits now?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We're seeing more stabilization in that category. And I will also say in that category we haven't yet seen the impact of Q4. We didn't see impact of the Escape II, it was launched towards the end of the quarter, at the end of fiscal year. So the reality is that sales force is now custom [ph] a lot attention on it. I expect that we will see that moving forward.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay. So, but volume growth overall for the business unit growth, rather is turned distinctly positive,", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "At versus where it was.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay, and then the underlying kind of concept of the competitive bidding dynamic and now they are going to delay the implementation and implement whatever, it is a 9% or so cut. And they list the demonstration areas and that goes national. Have you seen the impact of that already in the business, or is it that something that we are going to stare down later in the year?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, a couple of points to make on that. First I think the, what we heard from the industry was a collect sigh of relief, when that comprise was met. And the reason is it takes a lot of uncertainty at as of HME were feeling. They weren't sure exactly what they prep for. In other words many of the HMEs that won the bid didn't have a presence and the communities where they had won the bid there was a confusion around how they are going to care for those patients, is patient care going to be maintained in all that. So I think that in the first step was there was a really a collective sigh of relief that alright this is good compromise. I think the second part of it is I think you remember the CMS was the high priced player in the marketplace. Right so, most of private insurers will also already priced well below where we had seen the CMS side of the business.", "So and the final pieces is just to remind ourselves that 9.5% cut as I understand not implemented to January 1. So its gives people the time to sort of work through the strategies for growth in one hour.", "What... I will say one side, if we look back was about three years ago when there was significant option in that net cuts in the industry, and I remember distinctly of the time of having a conversations around what that going to mean is this a real negative industry. And the reality is the proceeded a significant growth in the sleep industry because HME are businesses and the HME need to look for avenues of growth and what they saw at that time, there is an area we can grow and its sleep and in fact where they tend to really grows in the compliant user side, we're getting more efficient to that the supply of mass, the patient because realized that they had under-penetrated that market but they under serve that marketplace and so the consequence is very different, that was anticipated. It was instruct able to look back on history to see how some of these things are played out.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Certainlyclarity goes a long way, the other side of this I guess is the gross margin because other than that issue in the quarter this is a strong result, if you think about your opportunities that you laid you out previously, are we talking hundreds of basis points, are we talking stabilization in 12 months?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So we've got different line items that are going to contribute different levels in that I think that and there are going to come at various times, that's good part of this right, again its not a single shot on goal we got multiple ways of addressing the opportunity for margin expansion, I think it's going to be a continuing, it's not going to be overnight one step, it's going to be improvement that we're going to see over the months and over series of time right.", "So some of those things are going to happen quickly like the Bilevel products right and they're launching and right the middle of launching those now and the Swift LT out for the full quarter, we'll be right in a mid there, that's for the shorter-term. All those products that we have in the pipeline will be hitting during the year, the manufacturing in Asia that will be coming more in towards the back of the year where we see the improvements. Supply chain, we've already begun that process in a number of months ago, so we're already starting to see some of the dividends that'll be playing. It's going to play itself out I think all the time.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "But again if we look at 12 months, you've got... you probably don't want to give specifics about the impact of going into a lower cost environment but are those going to be offset overall by continued price declines are we looking at absolute improvements in gross margins from the 58% or from the 68% level, or 60% level?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think when we look at all that 12 month horizon we should be able to see improvements.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Versus the 58 or the 60?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Certainly versus the 58% and 60% possibly.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Okay. I mean, we all crystal balls, but you get a little bit more information. So that's very helpful. Thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. No, no, I guess my summary on that is we feel very confident with the actions that we're taking, the product pipeline and with the very specific actions that we're taking on margin expansion.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks guys, can you hear me?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Maybe, I can just start with some shop keeping questions. Kieran, I think you gave us the U.S growth rate for flow generators, but I may have missed the number from masks and the U.S. numbers?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I want to Brett was actually the guy, he went through all the details, he's got closest line there.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "For the Americas flow generators increased by 8%.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Yes.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "And masks and other was 18%.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Then for the South Americas [ph] that flow generators was up 24% and masks and other was up 49%.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "49%, great and then I think you said by that your net income excluding amortization and the recall charge was at $33.2 million which if my math is right gives you a tax rate of about 29.1% which was about 140 basis points drop versus the previous quarter. Is that reckon what would you guys have?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's was around 29% for the quarter pretty close to that and if you look at the full year rate was little over the 33 mark.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I see.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Going forward and that 30% mark probably realistic...", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. 30%. Can you just help us understand what the any particular items were, perhaps here in the fourth quarter, that help you guys that are on the bottom line with the tax rate, just provide a little clarity in terms of what's driving that tax rate here in the quarter, please?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, so I would say the quarter some of that relights to some of the R&D concessions we get down here in Australia. We had a particularly strong quarter here lock in R&D spend for the quarter that will manifest it self in the effective tax rate, because of some of the tax concessions we get. And a continuation of the German tax rates which are kind of down at the beginning of the year, that's off to around 10% and Germany is doing well in those profits are coming through as lower tax rates. So, I mean there's a myriad of them, but there might be the two major ones.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, then one down in north [ph] and then the German tax rate being the two big drivers here in the quarter. Great.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes and as the Germany would have been with us for the full year that we continue to get that impact quarter-on-quarter.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Great, Kieran you guys have given some pretty good details on some what you think the drivers can be on the gross margin line. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to operating expenses?", "You've given some guidance to us on the R&D lines, but with respect to the SG&A line, can you may be comment a little bit on how you're feeling about the need to invest over the upcoming fiscal year '09, with the sales force in terms of market development activities for either their home testing opportunity to help out your DME customers or alternatively some of the areas, if you like you need to perhaps bone up on when, it comes to getting some more feet on the street to help with the new products that you have coming out here?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so I've been first of all, I've been very pleased with the performance of the global team and controlling operating expense, growth particularly during the time when as you know, there is foreign currency impact has been a challenge in controlling that headline.", "But we are looking on a constant currency basis. It's been just some very good cost control. Part of that is activities that we are engaged in throughout the globe, as an example that we described as an ops of the continuous improvement down in Australia, we are doing the same thing in Americas here using lean techniques in order to reduce efficiencies. I should say increase efficiencies, reduce elements that are interfering with our efficiencies.", "So a good standard operating procedure that gives me comfort that as we move forward that the dollars that we spend, will be spend in a right place which is market expansion, which is feet on the street, which is the ability to grow market share. Alright?", "So I think that we're doing the right things and have been doing the right things about focusing on efficiencies and focusing on market expansion opportunities. I think when at the operating cost as a percentage of revenues, you've seen we gained a little bit of leverage here in the last quarter.", "And I expect to continue that, but we are spending about the right level. We are not going to take our foot off the accelerators or too many good things happening in this industry. There is too much opportunity to try to reduce that to some level that would start critical initiatives. So I think we are going to continue the balanced approach, picking up efficiencies and some leverage as move forward, but making sure that we invest appropriately and expanding this highly and underserved marketplace.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you for that Kieran and then something that's been off the radar for a little bit is Simi [ph] or ResMed Paris, can you perhaps give us an update as to where those sales stand perhaps in terms of your U.S. markets and maybe when we can potentially look forward to some of these things... these products from the same acquisition looking coming into the U.S. market here?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so we continue to make good strides with the ventilation product line and the organization here is just seems to improve by the day. We continue to invest in them and they continue to respond to that investment. They've got a very a good product pipeline, a part of what we've done is gone in and done some significant product pipeline reengineering which is going to, we think going to significantly up-tick or increase our ability for market penetration overtime, it also delays a little bit.", "So our thought there is if we are going to swing we are going to swing the best, we are going for the big impact, as opposed to simply trying to make incremental changes or improvements. So we are doing well, that business doing is quite well ex-U.S. it's not yet time to bring it into the U.S. and we are not giving any specific timelines on that. But I can I can tell you I'm very pleased with the progress.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "And maybe if you can just give us a sense of where that business is going in terms of sales for the run rate?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We historically have not broken out to that level of details. So I feel little bit uncomfortable getting too much detail.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But just to say that it's positive and it's doing well and we're pleased with the performance.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. I'll take [indiscernible] out of that. And, a last one, just in terms of the U.S sales force, you said, you've laid out a very clear strategy here in terms of that putting the feet on the street. In terms of... and obviously had a very nice results here in the U.S. Is that the sort of result do you want to expect and given the nice product cycle you guys have coming here and that we can potentially expect going forward for over the next couple of quarters here with the U.S growth rate and, is there something you feel like will start to generate returns more in the near term or is it just to help us understand the timing of these investments and spending coming through. Thank you and I'll turn back into queue", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Okay if I understand the question correctly Paul, with that prospect in the near term I think that there are number of factors which are signals of encouragement, to my perspective to the Americas. Certainly the products flow as you know had been very strong I mean we hit the market. People care about compliance and in fact some of legislative changes moving forward probably are just going to increased the emphasis on compliance and with flow generators if you got the right algorithms and we absolutely have a market leading algorithms when you can reduce noise and on some products up to 90%.", "I really think about that up to 90% in a market at this point. They're important for the individual and they're important for the partner and help to buy this plan [ph] another things that makes me feel very comfortable that we have a seller U.S sales of course that is executing very well and I feel that if we speculate their executing even better their well trained with testing [ph]", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we've got a lot of opportunities to [indiscernible]. Marsha?", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson from Wachovia Capital Partners. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Hi.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "I guess first of all I know you talked a little bit about the cut that facing your customers on due to the competitive bidding '08 just wondering how much if any of that 9.5% cut you think you'll end up having to bare?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes it's always hard to say, this is marketplace where every year people are coming with cup and hand and kind of things and I don't expect that to change in this year then in another year. But I think one of the positive things that is happened is we've absorbed a lot of the price compression over this last year, right, so there was some pretty significant movement and I think that has taken a lot of pressure of the HME's that might have otherwise been there.", "And we're hearing from the HME's this point is looked they're looking for quality products they at a competitive price that we've been able to make the adjustment necessary to be in that competitive price range and they're also looking for future that going to make their life easier because many of them recognizing that this is about the cost not just about the price that they buy something with.", "It's about quality and we by far have the market leading quality products in this industry and that has a big effect on their ability to serve and I mean one of the funny things about rising oil prices is these guys run a lot of trucks and if they have got to go out to patients homes and they have to go for multiple calls because of quality issues that's going to cost their money, they don't want to deal with that, they think the same way on the masks side.", "So I think that we have been on one side very fortunate but I think it's on the other side it's been part of our very specific strategy that people are recognizing the cost advantages of the cost savings associated with quality products.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Okay. Aand then I was wondering if you've noticed or heard of any dollar reports of an economic impact on the demand for sleep studies and or CPAP equipment.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it's really no new news on that; I think the last couple of quarters have been no real significant development that we're not here to lot about it.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Okay. And then given that year-to-date or you've launched the Escape II or sorry, S8 Escape... S8 II Escape, is there any risk that that's going to drive a negative mix shift, now that you're pushing some features down onto the lower end units?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think what we are doing is, we have taken a lower cost platform and we have been able to take the EPR, the Esptr [ph] the expletory pressure release function and be able to put it on that lower cost platform by doing some, I think some very innovative things. So, one of the things that refused to compromise on was quality of care and in that pressure release category, the different solutions are different and we feel very comfortable as though our customers that the EPR feature offers the most efficacious treatment and for that category of pressure relief, the secret though here was the ability to take that mode of care or therapy and be able to put it over to a platform that costs less fro us to make and allows us to be more price efficient in the marketplace.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Okay, and then just a question on your stock-based compensation. Can you give us out of that $5.3 million of how much of that was in... went into the SG&A category, how much that went in the R&D category?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Brett, do you want to handle that.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the most of it was in the SG&A. It's around, half a million, three-quarter of million in R&D and the balance is in SG&A, it's high bidding cost is up.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Okay. And is the $5.3 million number I assume is before tax?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Okay, can you give me what number would be net of tax?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the tax rate around there is roughly the 30% mark touch on that.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Partners", "Okay, alright. That's all I've got. Thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great, thanks very much. Marsha, I think we've time for another question.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much for taking my question. I am sort of a pattern girl. And you broke two patterns in this quarter, and it's been a topic of most of questions, but I want to another second or two on it, you went from16% revenue growth to 23% revenue growth.", "You went from 60% gross margin to 58.4%gross margins. How do we think about without giving guidance? Where do we go from here, is this the new starting point? Do I think about revenue growth again revenue growth again in the 20% plus range for ResMed and recovering gross margins. How do we think about that?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Joanne, you're absolutely right. We don't give specific guidance on that. So I'll go back to our statement we made earlier which is to say that we feel that on from a market perspective that the outside the U.S. we feel comfortable with long-term sustainable growth of 10% to 15% in the U.S. and the Americas we feel comfortable with the 15% to 20%.", "So market growth that is sustainable in that mid teens and we feel we can grow at and above as we have historically market growth so I'd say on what our prospects moving forward are... we feel very comfortable that we can get back to and are back to that level of growth. There is lot of things that impact both of those line items and a single quarter doesn't make a trend certainly in anyway but we're feeling very comfortable with where we're out in our life cycle.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay.Any change in the competitive landscape with respond extreme part of Philips?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "No I think, no we are very hopeful that Philips has a reputation for competing in marketplaces by focusing on innovation and market expansion. That's the way we like to compete in a marketplace and we think that help us for these long-term growth of the marketplace. And there is nothing that gives us pause at this point.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And is there are reasons you're taking the $3.1 million charge for the S8 recall now in the fourth quarter?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "This was... we felt at this point that it was predictable amount, but I remind everybody that's within 5% of our original estimates. And we felt it was time an appropriate to give the true up.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And Kieran you're anticipating future troops?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "At this point is as Brett had mentioned earlier we feel that this should be up.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you for your questions.", "Operator", "And I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran T. Gallahue for his final remarks. Please proceed, sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, great thanks Marsha and thank you all for your time and attention. I think as many of you have noted this was a very strong quarter for ResMed from the top-line growth that was we think quite exceptional to these strong results that came out of Americas across the board right on down to the record breaking cash.", "So we were very pleased with performance. I'm very proud of our employees throughout the globe and through all functions in the company who've all contributed to that. And I look forward to updating you on the next conference call.", "Operator", "Thank you for participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

(NYSE:RMD) Q1 FY09 Earnings Call November  6, 2008  4:30 PM ET", "Executives", "Brett Sandercock - CFO", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and CEO", "David Pendarvis - Sr. VP of Organizational Development and General Counsel", "Analysts", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "David Stanton - ABN Amro", "Helen Cameron - Citigroup", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2009 ResMed Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jerry and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose.", "Second, during the conference call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website, at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, you may go ahead, sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Cherrie, and welcome everybody to ResMed's Q1 conference call. As in the past, we're going to begin with an overview of the business and the quarter, and then I'm going to hand the ball over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide details of the financial results, and then we'll open the call up to your questions.", "So for those of you that have seen the press release, you can see that Q1 was once again a record quarter for ResMed. We are very pleased with our progress across the globe as the ResMed team continues to execute quite well.", "As always, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our team members from around the globe from the various functions for their efforts, their contributions, and most importantly, for the results.", "So let's get into the quarter. Well, global revenues grew at a robust 17% in the first quarter of 2009, and this growth was again very balanced across geographies. Americas revenue growth accelerated to 16%, up sequentially from 14% in Q4, and RoW did one better with an 18% growth rate in Q1 '09.", "We also saw balanced growth across product categories, with both the global flow generator and mask segments growing at 17% each during the quarter. Flow generator growth was bolstered by a full quarter of our S8II CPAP line that we launched in Q4 and which is evidenced by the US flow generator line, which is up 14% in Q1, up from 8% growth in Q4. So we continue to make progress in that area.", "Our new Easy-Breathe technology continues to set a new standard in the industry. It's helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors and it really is a quantum leap in improved noise level and in comfort for patients.", "It's notable to mention that the fastest growing segment in the US flow generator business in percentage terms is our AutoSet product category. ResMed continues to be the leader in APAP technology and we've invested heavily in R&D over the years, and we continue to do so.", "During Q1, we also began launching our new VPAP line, which is now in the smaller S8 box. This brings the Easy-Breathe technology into our bilevel product line, so we're excited about the potential upside moving into Q2 and beyond, because this is our first new series of bilevels in five years. So a huge upgrade for the product line, one that I can tell you the sales force is incredibly excited about.", "The mask segment posted another double-digit quarter globally due to new product introductions led by the smaller low-noise nasal pillows mask, the Swift LT.", "We also recently launched the first mask product specifically designed by women and for women, called the Swift LT for Her. We expect this new addition to the Swift product line will provide a comfortable and quiet solution for our female patients, as this is the first and only gender-specific mask product on the market.", "Now, the question is why did we do it? We did it because women now represent 30% to 50% of newly diagnosed patients going into certain labs. So it is an important segment that is becoming increasingly important and gives us the opportunity to design new products and marketing categories around that vastly growing market.", "Additionally, gross margins stabilized in Q1, even in the face of growing Americas sales and a significant uptick in flow generator sales. We remain confident that we'll be able to improve margins as we progress in fiscal year '09.", "I'd also like to point out that we generated a record amount of cash this quarter, with $67.9 million in operating cash flow. That means in the past two quarters we've generated approximately $125 million in operating cash flow. This demonstrates our commitment to strong operating performance and a commitment to working capital control.", "During these recent times of global economic uncertainty, our deliberate focus on building a strong balance sheet with exceptional liquidity has proved to be a successful and an appropriate strategy.", "We continue to repurchase stock during Q1 with $24.1 million in share buybacks during the quarter. And as of September 30, 2008, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares in an authorized $8 million share buyback program.", "On the market development front, there's been an astounding three months or so of validation of the critical role that SDB plays in very serious comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. We are pleased to see the newly revised cardiovascular disease guidelines in Europe now include a formal recommendation for the use of CPAP therapy in symptomatic heart failure patients.", "What I'm referring to, of course, is the recent released European Society of Cardiologists' guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic and acute heart failure. This is the first time ever these influential guidelines have referred to the importance of identifying and treating sleep disorder breathing in heart failure patients.", "This follows the International Diabetes Federation consensus statement on sleep apnea published in June, where global experts, after carefully reviewing the clinical literature, concluded that Type II diabetes should be evaluated to determine if SDB is present, and then it went on to confirm that CPAP treatment is a gold standard therapy.", "So to summarize, influential global bodies have confirmed what we've long believed and have long been communicating, that it's critical to identify and treat sleep disorder breathing in patients suffering from two of the most costly and chronic disease states on the planet, diabetes and heart failure.", "So in summary, this was another great quarter, another record quarter for ResMed and the industry. We're confident about our ability to grow the market in 2009 and beyond. We have a strong business model, a very strong balance sheet, with substantial cash and little debt, and we look forward to growing shareholder value in fiscal year '09.", "All right. Now over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the P&L and the quarterly results. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Great. Thanks, Kieran. I'll briefly run through our September quarter results.", "As Kieran noted, revenue for the September quarter was $217.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $5.8 million to our Q1 revenues. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14% over the prior year quarter.", "Our income from operations was $36.6 million for the quarter, and net income for the quarter was $28 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter.", "Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38.", "Gross margin for the quarter was 58.3%, consistent with Q4 FY'08, reflecting unfavorable geographic mix changes and foreign currency movements, offset by manufacturing improvements.", "The geographic mix impact was attributable to the acceleration of sales growth in US this quarter, while the strength in previous quarters of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar negatively impacted our gross margin.", "However, going forward, the recent and significant decline in the Australian dollar will be positive for our gross margin. I would expect this impact to be evident in the second half of fiscal '09, particularly in Q4, as inventory we are currently manufacturing is ultimately sold.", "We also continue to progress our margin expansion initiatives in areas such as supply chain, manufacturing and product development.", "SG&A for the quarter was $71.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A increased by a more modest 10% over the prior year quarter. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved slightly to 33% compared to the year ago figure of 34%.", "R&D expense for the quarter was $17.3 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, R&D increased by 29%. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 8% this quarter compared to the prior year September quarter of 7%.", "And looking forward, and subject of course to currency movements, we would expect R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to be in the 7% range for the balance of fiscal year 2009.", "The lower R&D spend as a percentage of revenue really reflects the depreciation in the Australian dollar against the US dollar, which happened recently, as the majority of our R&D spend is denominated in Australian dollars. I think it is important to note that we will continue to invest in product innovation throughout the economic cycle.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $1.9 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $5.6 million.", "Now, before I move on to the revenue breakdowns, I would like to discuss FX currency impacts on our financial results, particularly given the unprecedented movements and volatility we are currently experiencing in these FX markets.", "Obviously, we don't have a crystal ball in the area. However, assuming today's exchange rates are maintained, the net is we expect positive impact on our bottom-line in FY'09. However, on our revenue line, and again, based on today's exchange rates, we expect year-on-year currency headwinds in the range of $10 million to $15 million per quarter over the next two quarters.", "Conversely, while we will be negatively impacted on our top-line, we'll actually benefit at the net income line due to the contribution of lower costs associated with the depreciation of the Australian dollar and the euro relative to the US dollar.", "So over the next few quarters, we expect the net currency benefit, again assuming today's exchange rates, will equate to approximately $0.02 per quarter positive impact on our EPS. Furthermore, in Q4, we expect the positive impact to be north of $0.02, as inventory currently being manufactured in Australia is ultimately sold to customers and released to our P&L.", "Turning now to revenues in a little more detail, overall Americas sales were $113.6 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside of the Americas totaled $104.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenues between the product segments, in the Americas flow generator sales increased by 14% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 19%. The growth rates reflect the continuation of strong sales in our new product introductions, particularly the S8 flow generator range and the Swift LT nasal pillows mask.", "For revenues outside the Americas, flow generators increased by 20% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 15%, again driven by strong sales across all our key international geographic markets. On a group basis, flow generator sales increased by 17%, while masks and other also increased by 17%.", "Cash flow from operations was a record $67.9 million for the quarter, and it does reflect strong underlying earnings and an improvement in working capital management, and something we've been working fairly hard on for the last 12 months or so.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $34.5 million, and this included $21.9 million in building construction costs, predominantly associated with construction of our new headquarters in San Diego. We expect to incur a further construction cost of approximately $43 million over the balance of FY'09 in relation to this building. The expectation is we'll be completed towards the end of this fiscal year.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $14.3 million.", "We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 653,000 shares for consideration of $24.1 million. Again, as of today, we have repurchased 5.5 million shares out of a total approved buyback of 8 million.", "ResMed ended the first quarter of FY'09 in excellent financial shape. Our balance sheet remains very strong and is conservatively geared. At September 30, total assets stood at $1.3 billion and net equity was almost $1 billion. Cash and cash equivalents, net of our external debt, totaled $157 million.", "I would now like to hand the call back to Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right, great. Thanks, Brett. Well, why don't we\u2026 Cherrie, if we can open up the call to questions please.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Hi, guys. Congratulations.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Yeah. Just a question about the current economic environment, how sensitive do you think the sleep industry is to a weakening economy?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We haven't seen any impact, certainly no material impact out of changes within the economy. When we talk to our customers\u2026 obviously, they don't have a crystal ball, we don't have a crystal ball, but when we talk to them, they say that there is no material impact on them.", "So I think we're probably lucky here that we're in a category that there is a significant benefit that's brought to the patient for the symptomatic relief and where it's an important part of their life.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. And then, just a quick update on Apria, if you can let us know how things are progressing on that front.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. As always, I can't go into too much detail on any given customer. But I'll you, the relationship remains strong, it gets closer every day. Like many of our customers, we do everything we can to help them serve the patients and help them grow the marketplace and that holds us in good stead over time.", "So that relationship is developing very nicely.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "All right, great. Thanks a lot.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Great. Maybe a quick question first for Brett. Did I hear you say that the $10 million to $15 million FX benefit would occur over the next two quarters or few quarters?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Ben, on the revenue we'll have a headwind, so it will reduce our revenues between $10 million and $15 million over the next few quarters. So you're talking over Q2 and Q3.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "But, I mean the movements in the currency really occurred in the euro kind of September for the most part. And when we look at it, you don't get back to normalization for a full year. Is there something --", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct. Yeah, there will be further headwinds in quarters going out as well until you anniversary, so to speak. But given the currencies are moving around hugely at the moment, I didn't think it was worth going further than that. But obviously, as you move out, if they stay the same, then you'd get\u2026 that $10 million to $15 million would grow. It would be higher in later quarters.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. It actually becomes bigger in the third and fourth quarter, primarily the fourth quarter out?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct. Provided exchange rates stay exactly where they are.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Yeah, I mean, that's --", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, correct.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "-- figure out where they are going to be in six months.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "That's right.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But, again, Ben, you got the bottom-line impact, and I think that's what we're all looking at here. The bottom-line impact is these currency exchange rates that we've seen are a net positive for us. Obviously, we can't control it, but we're pretty damn pleased by what we've seen happen here recently.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "I mean just to get an example, Brett, I think to put a fine point on it, in Aussie dollar terms, if you spent whatever it was on R&D this quarter, $16 million, if we were out and that same number was going to happen in the March quarter, wouldn't that be more like $12 million or $13 million?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I mean you guys you've seen the currency. If you look at the Aussie down from its highs, you should remember that the highs actually occurred in July of Q1. So we were actually in that quarter. It's probably down around 30% off its highs at the moment.", "So you can see that that will be a substantial benefit on the cost side for us. And if you roll that through and you roll through the headwind we have on the revenue and margins and so on, you will get a positive benefit on the bottom-line, and around that sort of $0.02 range. And as we move through Q4, we'll certainly be north of that.", "The top-line reduces, but the bottom line actually increases, because our cost base is substantially lower in US dollars.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. So my follow-up, I guess, I'll limit it like we should, but on the gross margin side, the cost of sales, how big a chunk of that, if you can tell us with any granularity, is coming from Aussie-denominated costs versus more global, maybe hedged cost?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The manufacturing, the majority of that is done down here in Sydney. So when you think about it, all the labor and overhead is obviously in Australian dollars, and some of the material. Obviously on the material front, we like to naturally hedge where we can. So we'll look to purchase in US dollars where we can. But a significant portion of the cost is Australian dollar-denominated.", "And that's why we're saying, as you move forward, and if that Aussie dollar is maintained where it is, we will get a significant improvement on our gross margin, because those costs will be so much lower. We don't feel that immediately because the inventory you make today you won't sell through the cycle for four or five months.", "So, therefore, you don't pick that benefit up until you finally release it in your P&L.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. Thank you. I will jump back in the queue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason? He is quiet today. All right. Why don't we move to the next one, Cherrie? Hello? Cherrie, are you still there?", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Paul Choi with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just a little bit, perhaps, on the operating expense side. Kieran, as you look into your\u2026 head into year, how do you feel with respect to the size of the sales force right now? You guys obviously have had a bunch of new products out here. You have the Swift LT for women coming out.", "Do you feel like you are comfortable with the size of the sales force, or do you want to go ahead and add a few more heads in the coming year?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, good question. Our focus is always on two areas, right? One is on market expansion, and that's one of our primary goals, the continuing growth of this market, and the second one is the capturing of market share. And the sales force actually gets involved\u2026 in fact, the whole commercial organization gets involved in both of those categories.", "And we continually look at the balance of our reps and the balance of other commercial assets to determine how we can make the biggest impact, both on market growth or market expansion, as well as market share. I can tell you the way that we're designed now, we're in pretty good shape.", "As our sales grow, you do tend to expand the organization on a variable basis, which is natural. You split territories and you look to expand it. We've got some great opportunities on the new market development side that give us the opportunity to look at growth into diabetes and making more people aware of the role that diabetes plays or SDB plays in diabetes and cardiovascular disease.", "So we're not looking at some massive expansion at this point, but doing what we always do, which is incrementally adding as we see opportunity to go grow either the market or grow our share.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks for that. Then in terms of your feedback from your customers right now, are they generally indicating in terms of their order patterns as they look ahead, given the fact that they will be facing some reimbursement cuts, for instance on the Medicare side and so forth.", "Are you seeing any particular change in order patterns among the DMEs in anticipation potentially of a slower economy in calendar 2009?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we're really not. But most of our customers don't carry much inventory from a days perspective. Their business model is not one that's built around significant inventory. So, no, we're not seeing any significant changes in that and I don't really anticipate any change in that.", "Paul Choi - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks for that and I'll jump back in queue.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Great, Paul.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter here. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my question relates to the market growth and volumes in general. It seems like just you guys are in a new product cycle. Volumes in the market from the checks we've done seem to be pretty healthy. It seems like on a constant currency, you were 14%. Can you just kind of talk to us?", "I know you obviously have headwinds with foreign exchange, so the way we should think about revenues definitely should keep that in mind. But in terms of just the volume side, can you just kind of talk about what you're seeing out there?", "And then, I guess sort of as a second part of that question, not to be too long-winded here, but the flow generation in the Americas grew 14%. That's a significant jump. It's been out for a full quarter. Can you kind of help us understand kind of what inning we are in this new product cycle, if we should see that kind of accelerate type of thing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. But that counts as your follow-up question. That's sort of two.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Fair enough.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no. Let me go after the first one first, the volume in the market. We've been saying the last couple of quarters that the market seems to be growing about 15%, where we see it may be a couple points below that on the revenue and a couple points above that on the volume and that seems to be maintaining itself.", "We're seeing good, solid, consistent growth. As we look forward with everything from home sleep testing to the IDF statement coming out to the guidelines on heart failure, we've got these great signals for the continued expansion of this marketplace because it is relevant in multiple medical silos and in the most costly comorbidities that exist and that are plaguing this planet. So, we're extremely well positioned and I think that's rolling through the results and it's rolling through the volume that we are seeing in the marketplace.", "As far us specifically, with the flow generator growth, yeah, you bet, we were very pleased to see that quarter-to-quarter we jumped from 8% growth in the United States right up to 14% growth in the United States. And that was really on the back of the CPAP range of flow generators, right, because that's what we had out for the full quarter. The S8II AutoSet and the Elite and Escape II.", "The bilevels, which we introduced in the Americas\u2026 two of the three of them we introduced in the Americas towards the backend of the quarter, one of them in the Americas we just released this quarter, Medtrade, and in Europe, we only released the bilevels at the ERS Show in October.", "So we've got these great bilevel products that will be coming through the pipeline here and impacting results, and it's a good margin product and one that still uses that Easy-Breathe technology and is just incredible. I mean, up to 90% quieter than the alternatives, better response rate, better performance. And we are seeing that in the results. It's just very, very good product and very good execution at the commercial level.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Great. That's really helpful. And then, just a follow-up. I know everyone is talking about this or asking about it, so I don't mean to ask it in a third way here. But I guess just on the FX on the bottom-line, obviously, very, very good here, helps your bottom-line.", "Just in terms of the gross margin, and obviously, R&D and the SG&A, I think, Brett, you gave us a good way to think about R&D for the rest of the year. But as we model out, just how should we sort of account for that benefit, more on the gross margin, more on the SG&A side, or sort of split it down the middle?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I mean those costs or the Australian dollar cost, the euro cost benefit throughout SG&A, R&D and our COGS line, obviously. Think about it from an SG&A perspective, we're likely to see an improvement in that ratio. We're at 33% to revenue. My view is that that will improve because it reflects the lower cost base that we'll have.", "And on the margin front or the COGS front, again, I want to stress that you don't see that impact immediately, but it will flow through and It flows through as you ultimately sell the inventory. So I think through Q4 you will see the full impact of that. And it will be a significant impact, and there is no reason why that shouldn't have an impact on the margin expansion of the margin as that rolls through. But at the moment, that's not immediate. That will take a little bit of time to roll through.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "I guess because between your new products, obviously, benefiting hopefully stronger in the US, especially on the flow generator side, with the bilevels coming through, et cetera, is it sort of fair to think of the savings coming on the SG&A line right now because of the mix?", "And then, as we go through the end of the year, we see the gross margin tick up more as well as benefit from the SG&A?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct. You'll get SG&A now in the more immediate because they are translation-type impacts. And then, the margin will come through later on. That way, that's a reasonable way to look at it.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis", "Great. Thanks for the clarification. Congrats again, guys. Great work.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "And you next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Hi, guys. Can you hear me this time?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I feel like it's a telephone commercial here. Yes, we can hear you.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "It's a good commercial this quarter. Thanks.", "So the question I have is about this $0.02 upside. It would seem to me that folks are going to focus on this. I think what you saw right after you reported your quarter is some confusion as you reported $0.36, but we all report to First Call $0.38. So I'm probably telling you stuff you already know, but I want to clarify, at least, for my own erudition here so that we all are on the same page.", "The $0.02 upside per quarter that you presume may come from foreign currency, could you talk about how that relates to baseline? A $0.02 upside to what? And perhaps, you could answer that with respect to how you've guided long-term for the business. Kieran, you've talked about sort of mid teens type revenue growth, mid to high teens type earnings growth. Do those sort of percentages apply? While you don't give guidance, do those apply? And then, from that we are to expect perhaps the penny or two upside?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Kieran, do you want to answer that?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me just answer the market growth piece and then you can get into the financial piece, Brett.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, on the growth piece, you had mentioned mid to long-term looking at mid teens growth. I do want to highlight to you, the question was about market growth, right? What the market growth was going to be. We see it around 15%, a little bit lower on revenue and a little bit higher on volume.", "Our goal has always been and our history has always been that we've been able to outgrow the marketplace. As we look forward, and we look at these other market drivers, if you are talking about certainly the timeframes you are talking about or mentioned, we continue to believe that this market will grow robustly and we continue to believe that we have the ability to outgrow that marketplace.", "So I just want to be clear about that that those are two different questions. But anyway --", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Fair enough.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Brett, do you want to answer the EPS question?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, great. So, Jason, what I've done is tried to simplify down what their net impact is going to be and what our view is really of the base rate or currency there\u2026 is our average rates for this very quarter, for Q1. So if you look at that, it was around the 150 mark for the euro and around $0.88 for the Aussie. So they're still quite high.", "I mean, clearly, it's unprecedented that you would get that sort of decline in exchange rates in any ordinary time. So I think the way we've done it, the way we've hedged with purely option structures and so on means we have not taken out forward. So we can really only lose what we put in, in terms of premium or mark-to-market.", "So its put us in good stead to really participate in these lower exchange levels. And you'll see that come through on the bottom-line. My estimates are around $0.02 per quarter for the next few and going north of that in Q4.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Great. So, let me come clear here, Kieran and Brett. I am trying to nail you down on guidance that you don't give. So, with all of that out on the table.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "At least we've got it out in the open now, Jason.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "With all that out on the table, so '05, '06 you're a low to mid-20s type grower. '07 and '08, we were sort of between mid-single digits and low-double digits. So you do have easier comps. You have a favorable currency tailwind to your earnings. New product cycle in the US. And you've talked about your business, the end market looking pretty good.", "So I know I am not going to get you to give us a number, but perhaps you could talk about growth rates, earnings growth rates. Kieran, you mentioned that that is the most important thing. So help us out so we can model this a bit better. And then we can make our\u2026 draw our conclusions about how currency could positively impact that level in our own models.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, look, I think, the guidance that we've provided over the long haul, which is that the Americas market tends to grow in that 15% to 20% range; that the ROW market tends to grow in the 10% to 15% range; than you sort of bucket that all in and you are in the mid-to-upper teens; and growth in the marketplace; and we tend to outgrow that. I continue to strongly believe in that.", "And we've tended to have earnings growing basically at the same rate. It varies quarter-to quarter, but basically at that same rate as revenues. And the reason for that is we do get leverage, but we also invest back in R&D and we invest back in market development. And in a market that is 85% to 90% untapped, we are going to continue to do that.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is an enormous amount of innovation to be brought to bear in the market. You saw what we invested in R&D this quarter. Why did we do it? Because we're accelerating certain product development projects that we see huge hope for. We are investing in a clinical study known as SERVE-HF, which is demonstrating the link between congestive heart failure and SDB, and when you treat that SDB the cardiovascular benefits that can occur. Those are very important markers, both for growing the marketplace as well as for establishing our position in that. And we absolutely plan to continue to invest.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord Adams", "Completely understand. Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions here. You mentioned that the auto setting product set is the fastest growing in the States. Can you elaborate why you think that is? Does it have something to do with at-home testing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know, I think it's got\u2026 there's a number of different drivers to it, right? So, number one, our product remains the absolute best algorithm in the marketplace. It long has been. But last year, the Americas commercial team specifically focused on ways that they could demonstrate and communicate that to customers, all right?", "So not just studies, which are very important and very compelling, but also to get a little bit more visceral, a little more hands on and we developed tools and techniques, which allowed comparison of our products to competitive products, are allowed them to see how the technologies worked in reality.", "And they could pull the competitors' product off their shelf, pull ours off. So there is nothing staged about this. It's real world selling tools. And those selling tools have really helped communicate the benefit of the technology, which has existed. So, I think that is a big part of it.", "In addition, we do have some things going on in the marketplace that bode well for auto setting technology as well as data-rich products. So, for instance, home sleep testing has a lot of people very interested in the idea of how they can effectively use auto setting devices.", "The requirements that seem to be developing on monitoring compliance, which we think are great, right? Because anything that focuses on patient compliance means that people are going to stay true to the therapy. It means that they are going to go through that early hump that everybody goes through, and then once you get a person compliant, you have them for decades. It's great for the patient, it's great for the healthcare system and governments that are paying for this, and it's great for our business over the long haul.", "And so the data-rich nature of our auto setting device allows the HME to help troubleshoot patient compliance and help figure out how they can improve that patient compliance. So I think there's multiple reasons for that stem from execution on the fundamental back of a great product.", "And I should mention, of course, the S8II motor is in there now, I mean the Easy-Breathe motor technology. I shouldn't forget that. I mean this is a hugely, hugely beneficial piece of technology that significantly reduces noise, continues on our high quality platform that's always driven ResMed, and allows that system to be even more responsive to patient needs.", "So we're just executing on a number of different fronts very well. The team is doing a great job.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "So with home sleep testing, the view is still that's maybe 12 months away from having any meaningful impact?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The starting gun has really gone off with home sleep testing. I mean it's\u2026 you've now got a number of private payers, that they are involved in. In fact, in just a minute, I will pass it over to Dave and he can talk a little bit more about this, Dave Pendarvis.", "But, we have long said, in fact, ever before home sleep testing was ever approved, we said, when this thing comes through there's going to be a time period of adoption where the things that are going to trigger us and say, this is going well are private insurers jumping on board with it over time.", "And it's also going to be pilots, that are going to be launched, that allow for different models of how to implement home testing to come through. And I'd tell you, you look a year ago to today, if you told me a year ago that the number of private payers would have jumped on board and the government was going to say the starting gun has gone off on home sleep testing, we'd have said\u2026 this is fantastic. And we do believe it's fantastic. It's moving very well.", "At Medtrade, we saw a number of both sleep physicians and HMEs, who were telling us about new models of home sleep testing that they are piloting. So this is beginning to happen. And so, we remain very bullish about the expectation. Dave, do you have anything to add on that?", "David Pendarvis - Senior Vice President of Organizational Development and General Counsel", "Just a little bit Kieran and Alex, I think what Kieran said was absolutely correct, that if you look at the progress we've made so far, we are very encouraged by it. We think more progress will continue to be made.", "CIGNA and United, two large private health insurers, have authorized home testing under their policies. The federal government under the CMS guidelines authorized home testing. And also, you are starting to see now, beginning in November 1 just a few days ago, the new compliance standards, which are not directly related to home testing but came out at about the same time, being put into place. We think any emphasis on compliance is going to be good for us.", "As you indicated earlier, it would help drive sales of the AutoSet device and other data-rich devices. So, we think it's going to be slow and steady and inexorable progress with regards to home sleep testing and the emphasis on compliance.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Final question, if I may, probably for Brett, about the working capital improvements that have gone to help operating cash flows. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what those working capital improvements have been? And can we expect more of them?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, on the working capital, Alex, I mean the big one has really been driving down the inventory and improving our inventory turnover, over, probably trended down over the last six months or so. That's been a big benefit to us. And we were a little distracted somewhat previously with the recall, as well and purchasing for that, and the building of those units and so on. That's all behind us now. We can focus back on really getting that down to an efficient level of inventory holdings. So that has had a big impact.", "Receivables, we looked at around the group as well. We have just sat there and done a lot of the basics right and looked through there. Creditors, we've try to realign through supply accounts and so on. Just to realign days sales we have with suppliers, to more realign with what we get with our customers.", "Just a lot of those things that we're doing that hopefully we are getting right and we'll see that working capital improves. I mean, clearly, you cannot get your working capital to zero, so to speak, but is there improvement left? Yes, I believe we still have improvement that we can make there and I think we will.", "We have also put in software, for example, in part of our forecasting and planning. That, we think, has already shown a good early results. And I think that will improve our overall planning and forecasting, for example, in manufacturing.", "So, a lot of things that we're doing on multiple fronts that maybe not a silver bullet, but add them up and they really do have an impact. And we'll stay focused on that, particularly in the current environment. Obviously, you can't be lazy in those areas.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much, guys.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from line of Joanne Wuensch with BTO [ph] Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "I changed firms again, apparently. Thank you very much for taking my question. Joanne from BMO. A couple of housekeeping questions. The tax rate in the quarter was somewhat lower than we had expected. Could you give us an idea of what you think your full year tax rate may be?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, Joanne, I think when I've looked at that and we've looked through what we're forecasting through the year and the geographic mix and so on. I think around that 28% mark is a reasonable estimate of the tax rate going forward.", "We've benefiting from R&D concessions, obviously, here in Australia. Also, continue to benefit, for example, Germany. It's a little while ago now, but reduced their corporate tax rates quite significantly. As you know, we have a sizable operation in Germany.", "So those factors have tended to bring that down a little over time. And around that 28% is, I think, a reasonable estimate going forward.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, that's helpful. What was your exit rate share count in the first quarter?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Exit rate? So just the closing rate of shares, or --", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Not the average rate for the quarter. What's your released exit rate?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, well, average dollar shares outstanding was $77.2 million.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Right, I'm asking the exit, not the average for the quarter.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "That at exit? Around a little lower than that, probably just under\u2026 a little under $77 million.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "All right. You guys have done a very good job of pushing, encouraging, researching sleep apnea and the comorbidities. At what stage do you think you might be in a position to start breaking out the contribution to revenue? Are you in a position to say that 5% of the revenue growth comes from comorbidities at this stage?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. There is such a mix in the way that the volume that gets driven out of these comorbidities exists that breaking it out would not really be a useful exercise. Remember, these are patients who have comorbidities. But what they're presenting, what we're treating in many cases is stop [ph] standard SDB, right? I mean it is the disorder. We treat it with the same products and the same technologies. The difference is where the referrals are coming from.", "Now there is a difference there on advanced heart failure, as an example, when we use products such as the ACS2, the adaptive servo-ventilation, which, by the way, since you brought it up, is an incredible technology.", "We had in addition to the SERVE-HF, there is a pilot study that we're doing, a smaller study up in the Nordics, where there is 10 patients. And this hasn't been published yet, but since I am not going to get specific on it, I can talk a little bit about it.", "10 patients, which have gone on the device in the last\u2026 well, I guess it's about six months now, a little bit under six months. One of those was on a heart transplant list. That person was released from the heart transplant list. So we've got some phenomenal data coming out of the comorbidities. But it's not the type of data it would make sense for us to break out in results.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, not to beat a dead horse on this FX impact, I want to think about this slightly differently. If you had operating margins of, call it, 21.2% in fiscal year '08, would you be surprised to see your operating margins up 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal year '09?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Brett, do you want to take that?", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I mean, the problem is there's a lot of factors and a lot of movements and things that happen. But if you said if all things being equal and the currencies where they are, then you would expect an expansion on that.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Right. But I'm trying to ask without\u2026 I know you guys don't give guidance, without giving guidance. Back into what the impact is to the bottom-line and then we're expanding margins, and then you quantify it as $0.02. And to go back to Jason's questions, it is $0.02 on top of what? So I want to sort of peel away all that to sort of say, what does it mean for operating margins?", "And so, I am coming up when I plug in all my FX numbers, probably an expansion of about 100 basis points year-over-year. And I am just trying to see if that's in the ballpark of what you guys are coming up assuming FX rates stay the same way they are.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, we don't want to specifically start down the guidance path, because we don't, as you guys say. But just look at it logically. If those currencies, there is improvement there, our cost base is reduced, and so on. Then you expect that there would be an improvement there.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, I tried. Thank you.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Hi.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Let's see. I just got on from another call, so I apologize.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, wait. You mean you missed the whole intro?", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Yes, unfortunately. We've done one of our surveys here again, and we asked the question of the HMEs about this 9.5% reimbursement cut. And at a high percentage of them seems to think that that will spill over to the private pay in part of the market. Then I know that's a little bit different from kind of your perspective.", "I was just wondering if you could give me your thoughts on that. Maybe why do you think that their perception is that some of these private insurers may try to follow that?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, well, you are going to get a lot of diversity in what people say. Certainly, we talk to substantial numbers of these HMEs on a daily basis, and there is always quite a bit of variability and everybody always ends up the conversation the same way, which is\u2026 none of us has a crystal ball.", "But I'll tell you, when I look at this I look at history, right? And that's the way we as an organization look at it. And if you go the last time the CMS went through a significant cut, which is about three years ago, right? With the oxygen and the Mednet cuts.", "And there was a lot of question at that time, a lot of handwringing. Is this going to be something that's going to be very difficult? Is it going to spread through all the product lines? Is this going to be a negative for us?", "And the reality of what happened is\u2026 these HMEs are businesses and they need to figure out how to be profitable, and they need to figure out how to grow. And many of them found sleep at that point. And maybe more importantly, they found that in order to grow their business, there was this great thing called trailing revenues or annuity businesses that was available to them if they followed up with their compliant patients or would be available to them as they increase compliance.", "So, as we look at these times of change, I see opportunity. This is an opportunity for us to demonstrate to HMEs, to show them how they can grow. We're getting much more receptive ears about how to approach the diabetes marketplace and the cardiovascular marketplace. We're getting very receptive ears about how to grow accessory programs. So I\u2026 when we look at these things, we see opportunity. We take it that way, and we're tending to have some very positive discussions with our customers.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. I noticed that your accounts receivable were up by a couple, I guess, three days. I've heard some scuttlebutt out there about some strains in the HME community. Should we be concerned about that? Is there a risk that that could continue to go up and you could have to write-down some of your receivables or something at some point if the economy continues to be under pressure?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Look, we're feeling that our\u2026 the policies that we have with our customers are quite sound. We've got very good relationship with customers across the marketplace. We have a very broad group of customers, so we don't have a massive concentration in any given customer.", "We monitor our payments from our customers on a regular basis. If we think that something is causing us concern, then we have conversations with them. And if necessary, we modify our behaviors. But that's something that's part of our ongoing business. So at this point, we're not seeing anything that gives us any great concern at all.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And you may have already talked about this, but just an update on how you're doing within Apria. Have you made any progress in terms of picking up any market share there so far?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. It was asked earlier, but the answer to the question was, look, we were not going to go into a lot of detail on any customer relationship because we respect the privacy of those customers, and for obvious competitive reasons.", "What I will say is that that relationship, like the relationships we have with other large customers, are quite sound. We have a very energetic and capable sales team, both at the field level as well as the key account level.", "I'd say that the Americas commercial organization, overall, is executing incredibly well. Very crisply. And that translates into our relationship with our customers. So we're feeling very good about that relationship as well as the relationship we have with other major customers.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And then on R&D, it was up some. Can we expect it to stay closer to 8% over the next few quarters?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so what we're saying is that you can expect it around the 7% level is around what we're expecting.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So we're going to continue to invest through the cycle. We've got some benefits on the foreign exchange side, given that a lot of that's denominated in Oz dollars, but we will continue to invest.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "All right, that's all I've got. Thanks a lot.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. You bet, Michael.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. Kieran, if I could get you to talk about rest of world sales, and particularly mask sales we saw come off on a sequential basis. Is there anything to speak of there, as to why that slipped? And perhaps, if I could get you to talk about the key markets outside the US as a general question.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well, we\u2026 thank you for asking that. We do tend to spend a lot of time on the Americas and we've got an exceptional organization throughout the globe. And that deserve to be recognized for the accomplishments that they are making both in growing the market and for gaining market share.", "We are doing quite well, both in Europe and in the Asia Pac area. We've seen some very significant improvements in markets such as Germany. We've talked quite a few years about the transitions that we have been going through in Germany and some of the challenges of consolidation.", "And under the leadership of Lasse Beijer and Frank Rebbert, they've done an excellent job of a growing an organization, getting them commercially focused, putting in the tools and techniques that allow them to grow.", "Japan is doing very, very well for us across the board and across our partners there. Obviously, we have some markets that have some challenges. So there's always some ups and some downs. And the balance of that is that we're doing quite well in ROW and the team does feel good and should feel good about themselves.", "Specifically in mask, quarter-to-quarter you're going to get some variations in some of the line items. I wouldn't read too much into that. Summer months in Europe are always an odd time anyway, so I wouldn't read too much into that.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks very much. And just the other question, we've talked in the past a lot about pricing in the States, particularly. And my understanding is post Philips taking out Respironics, things have calmed down, but maybe just as a general question there, what are you seeing on the pricing front and the level of competitiveness on that front?", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We're feeling good about the pricing environment now. There is always a bit of price pressure out there, but you compare it to where it was six month ago, nine months ago, we're I think in a very good position today.", "As you mentioned, Philips has been a good competitor to date. We haven't seen a lot of changes in their field organization or emphasis or focus at this point. And I remain hopeful that that organization will do as it has in other areas of medical technologies, which is invest in market expansion, invest in innovation, and not play the price game. Because I don't think that does anybody any good. And so far, everything we've seen has been consistent with that.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "All right, thanks very much.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Stanton with ABN AMRO. Please proceed.", "David Stanton - ABN Amro", "Thanks. Just to David's question previously, can you also talk about I guess pricing in Europe, with Philips in that market now? And also, I guess my follow-up is around the impact of home diagnosis. Are you seeing any declines in the number of beds that are being built in sleep centers in anticipation of home diagnosis growing? Thanks a lot.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, on the European front, we're not seeing the acquisition of Respironics by Philips really any significant changes in Europe at this point at all. So that organization seems to have\u2026 I don't know if it's been left alone, but certainly what we're seeing from a commercial perspective is quite a bit of status quo. And we're certainly comfortable with that.", "As far as the home sleep testing, yes, look, we're not seeing\u2026 we're not hearing from sleep labs that they are slowing down expansion. The funny thing is that as you've gone through this year, as more and more clarity has been brought to bear on home sleep testing, actually you see many members of the sleep community are gaining comfort and getting an understanding of how they can use home sleep testing, and how they can use PSG. Because PSGs aren't going away.", "We have long believed that the introduction of home sleep testing is actually going to drive greater volume of PSGs. Because as our Chairman has often said, it is moving us from fishing in a pond to fishing in the ocean, because we're able to access and treat and help more patients because of the simplification of the diagnostic process as well as the expansion of capacity when you aggregate both the PSGs and the home sleep tests.", "So we're not hearing\u2026 in fact, last week at Medtrade, I was hearing of a number of labs that were talking about expansion, in fact, were in the process of expansion. So I was quite encouraged to hear that, actually.", "David Stanton - ABN Amro", "Thanks a lot.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "You bet.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Helen Cameron with Citi. Please proceed.", "Helen Cameron - Citigroup", "Thank you. Just a brief question on depreciation. It's dropped $2 million in this quarter after being higher for the previous two. Just wondering whether annualized we're looking at a lower depreciation figure there of around $8 million.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, the depreciation and amortization for the quarter, Helen, is down a little bit. It's around that $14.3 million mark. Currencies where they are, around that number, perhaps slightly less would be probably in the ballpark.", "Helen Cameron - Citigroup", "So annualized, probably around $8 million lower.", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, if you look\u2026 yes, around that figure.", "Helen Cameron - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will now turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for his final remarks. Please proceed, sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you, Jerry, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. As always, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank our employees throughout the globe in the various functions. That is what drives ResMed, and it's a fabulous team and one that we are very proud of here.", "I can tell also that, as you can hear from the call today, it was another great quarter, another record quarter for us in many different ways. We've seen some fabulous opportunities for market expansion in both the cardiovascular space and diabetes as well as through further improvement and adoption of the home sleep testing.", "We've got great high margin new products rolling out in the masks and the bilevels. We've got new national account wins that we're implementing. Just a lot of good things going on, and we're very excited about the year as we move forward. So, thank you again for your interest. We appreciate it and we look forward to updating you as we move forward.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

Gallahue - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Brian Kennedy - Jefferies & Co.", "Operator", "Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2009 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tania, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions).", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projection of forward... of future revenue of earnings, new product developments or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which maybe accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Thanks Tania. Well, good afternoon, welcome to ResMed's third quarter earnings call.", "As with our previous calls, I'm going to begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer. He will go through the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.", "So for those of you, who have seen the press release, you know the we had another very solid quarter. Once again, we demonstrated the power of being a well balanced geographically diversified company with well accepted high quality diverse mix of profits.", "We are pleased to report the global revenue in the third quarter 2009 grew 8%, or up 16% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in the Americas accelerated to 23% year-over-year, which is the same growth we experience in Q2 of 2009.", "ROW revenue declined by 6% in constant currency terms... excuse me, but in constant currency terms, it grew 10%, which is also a sequential improvement. As expected, currency had a significant effect on ROW revenue. GAAP EPS increased 34% to $0.51, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was one penny better at $0.52.", "We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generator sales, up 7% or at 16% in constant currency. And mask segments growing at 9% during the quarter, which also translates to a 16% increase in constant currency.", "We saw significant growth in all product segments of flow generators. Globally, the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, especially the S8 AutoSet II and VPAP Auto. We also had solid growth in our mid-range S8 Escape II now with EPR patient comfort functionality.", "Both revenue and unit volumes increased across the flow generator product line in Americas and Europe. Sales of Americas' flow generators were up 24% year-over-year in Q3 and similar growth to Q2 of '09 and sales in ROW improved to 11% in constant currency terms.", "As a result of changing product mix in the sleep device category towards higher end technology, our gross margins are also improving. The fastest growing segment in the U.S. flow generator business in percentage terms continues to be the auto adjusting, positive airwave pressure and bilevel segments. This plays well into our clinical leadership with the S8 AutoSet II, VPAP Auto, as well as our new VPAP S along with other products in these segments.", "Europe showed particularly strong growth in the VPAP IV series sales. In France and Germany, we continue to gain market share in this important high margin, flow generator market segment. Ventilation business unit sales as a whole, also rebounded in Europe.", "Our Easy-Breathe technology is now available across the entire sleep device platforms from CPAP to APAP and through to our VPAP SV devises. The whisper-quiet comfortable performance of Easy-Breathe is truly being recognized as best in class. Easy-Breathe technology has set a new standard in the industry and it's helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved comfort and reduced noise.", "With CMS mandating patient compliance for ongoing payment, sales of our wireless compliance technology, ResTracks GSM (ph) are growing significantly with more and more momentum. We remain the only company that provides wireless transcripts sleep apnea data to an Internet system.", "Customers are finding that the wireless approach can be convenient and highly affective to not only capture compliance data, but also to monitor efficacy of treatment. We believe that physicians indeed CMEs, who want to further drive compliance beyond Medicare patients. This will occur a sleep disorder breathing treatment compliance monitoring as shown to lower medical costs and improve efficiencies. At that point, other payers are very likely to follow suite.", "Once again we posted double digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter and continued to increase market share. Mask sales grew 22% in the Americas and in constant currency terms grew 8% in ROW. Mask sales in the Americas were strong across all product lines, with the Mirage Activa LT, the Swift LT and Swift LT for Her doing particularly well. There are some of the best selling masks in the marketplace.", "As a remainder, these re-designed LT masks are smaller, lighter and more streamline versions of the predecessors. The Swift LT for Her product is gaining traction as a comfortable and quiet solution for our female patients as this is the first and only general specific product mask product in the market.", "It's also an ideal solution for side sleepers. And the Activa LT is less oppressive mask because patient's superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients. With these new masks in the global marketplace, we remain focused on growing market share with high margin industry leading profits.", "Looking forward over the next 12 to 15 months, we plan to launch a series of new products and flow generators. In addition within the next several months, we plan to introduce the ApneaLink Plus, our type three home diagnostic devices that will meet even more of the existing reimbursement and position requirements.", "As we said last quarter, we will be watching home testing carefully throughout 2009 and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms this calendar year. We are working closely with our sleep position partners to make home testing reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy.", "We also expect growth result from continued and improved awareness in validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays and a very serious, most rapidly growing and most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.", "Although sleep disorder breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders and races is becoming widely recognized that heart disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand in hand with sleep disorder breathing and treatments for sleep disorder breathing can not only improve health, but may dramatically lower healthcare costs within these populations.", "Ten months ago we projected that we would be able to grow gross margins and we are pleased to report that gross margin improved 60 to 61% in Q3. Benefiting from currency impact, favorable geographic product mix driven by high and flow end generators and masks as well as our margin improvement plan gaining traction.", "We're confident that we can continue to maintain gross margins around this level in fiscal 2009 as we further penetrate markets with our new products and continue to leverage cost efficiencies across our global organization with improvements in supply chain and manufacturing while also ramping production in Singapore.", "Again we had as strong performance in operating flow. We came in at $44.2 million demonstrating our commitment to strong performance and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with the cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q3 over $327 million.", "Now over to Brett to provide some additional details on the P&L and then we'll take your questions. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Kieran.", "Let's briefly run through our March quarter results. And as Kieran added, revenue for the March quarter was 227.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter.", "As expected unfavorable currency movements reduced our third quarter revenues by approximately 17.6 million. So in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 16% over the prior year quarter.", "Our income from operations for the quarter was 52.5 million, an increase of 40% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was 39.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter.", "Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.52. Our gross margin for the quarter was 61%, which is up sequentially from Q2, FY '09, reflecting foreign currency movements, favorable product mix and manufacturing improvements.", "The product mix impact was largely attributable to the continuation of strong sales in a new available range in all our safety devices, particularly in our domestic market. Our third quarter margin now reflects the full benefits associated with the deprecation in the Australian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar.", "Looking forward, we expect this currency impact together with our ongoing margin improvement initiatives in supply chain, manufacturing and product development, should say our gross margin keep continue in the range of 60 to 62% for the balance of fiscal year '09.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter was 70.9 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 13% over the prior year quarter. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue improved to 31% compared to the year ago figure of 33%. The modest growth in headline SG&A expenses reflects the impact of the depreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar.", "R&D expenses for the quarter was 13.9 million, a decrease of 7% of the prior year quarter. However, in constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 22% over the prior year quarter. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was 6%, compared to 7% in the prior year quarter. And looking forward, subject of course the currency movements, we expect R&D expenses at percentages of revenue to be in the 6% range for the balance of fiscal year '09.", "The lower R&D spend as percentage of revenue reflected depreciation of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar as a majority of our R&D spending dominated in Australian dollars. We do continue to invest in product innovation and clinical study activities.", "Amortization of the core intangibles is 1.7 million for the quarter and stock based compensation expense for the quarter was 6.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.9% and looking forward, we expect our fiscal year 2010 tax rate to bring the vicinity of 26%.", "Turning now to our revenue since recapping some of those numbers, the overall Americas sales were 122.5 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generated and masks with strong contributions from our autosetting sleeping devices, a new range of bilevel devices and our Swift LT masks.", "As a reminder, I know that Q3, the last quarter, prior to the anniversary of the introduction into the U.S. market, was very successful with S8 II flow generator range and Swift LT masks. So, outside the Americas totaled 105.4 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior year quarter.", "As expected, sales outside of the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particularly depreciation of the euro against U.S. dollar. In constant currency terms, sales outside Americas increased by 10% over the prior year quarter, with balanced growth across our flow generator and mask categories.", "Breaking out revenues between product segments in the Americas flow generator sales increased by 24% over the prior year quarter while masks increased by 22%.", "For revenues outside the Americas and in constant currency terms, flow generators increased by 11% over the prior year quarter while masks and other increased by 8%. On a group basis and constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 16% while masks also increased by 16%.", "Our cash flow from operations was a solid 44.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and modest growth in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was 22 million, including 10.6 million in building construction costs, associated with the construction of our new headquarters in San Diego.", "I am pleased to note that building is now completed, and we have scheduled to relocate to the new premises on May 11, 2009. We'll make final payments associated with the building, approximately 21 million that's spread over the next few quarters. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled 12.5 million.", "We continue to buyback shares, as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 769,000 shares, a consideration of 26.6 million as part of our ongoing buyback program. For the fiscal year to-date, we have repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of 52.7 million. As of today, we have repurchased approximately 6.4 million shares out of the total approved buyback of 8 million shares.", "ResMed ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 in excellent financial shape. Our balance sheet remains very strong and is conservatively geared. At March 31, total assets stood at 1.3 billion and net equity was 1 billion. Group external debt was 160 million while our cash and cash equivalents totaled 327 million.", "I'd now like to make some comments in relation to currency movements and their expected impact on our fourth quarter results assuming current exchange rates.", "Firstly, we will continue to experience year-on-year currency headwinds in relation to group revenue. I highlight that this would be a significant impact on our Q4 revenue as reported in U.S. dollars. Specifically for the last quarter of fiscal year '09, we estimate currency headwinds of between 20 and 25 million.", "Conversely, our operating expenses will continue to benefit from the depreciation of international currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This benefit is reflected in our Q3 results and therefore it provides an indicative base for our operating expense run rate over the next few quarters. Subject of course that currency movements over these period, and you'll note the currency movements have been very volatile; I'll walk you though soon (ph).", "Finally, our gross margin now reflects the full benefit with the Australian dollar appreciation; and therefore on a sequential basis, we're not expecting further margin expansion through the impact of favorable currency movements.", "In summary, we expect currency movements to continue to have a positive impact on our net income in the fourth quarter of '09. And we expect net income to grow faster than our constant currency revenue growth.", "Now, I'd like to hand the call back to Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Great. Thanks, Brett. And thank you for reviewing those numbers again, certainly another strong quarter.", "Tanya, why don't we open it up for questions now?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Yeah. Hey guys, congratulations on a great quarter.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thank you.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "I guess first question for, Brett. I was hoping you could maybe split out currency and mix from the gross margin improvement, and give us the currency impact on EPS for the quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, I mean if you look to the sequential increases, you see majority would be currency driven, but there's certainly a decent amount of that of the margin improvement is product mix or favorable product mix. Some kind of small improvements with... through manufacturing improvements, but I think most of those improvements will start to manifest themselves in FY '10. But certainly, we had a measurable contribution form both product mix and foreign currency movements or more specifically the falling Australian dollar. If you look... if you want everything clear, it's pretty complex, but you're probably talking in the order of... for instance on the bottom line on currency impact, if you wash it all through.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. And then I guess for Kieran, you talked about over the next 12 to 15 months we should see some more product on the full generator masks side. Can you give us a little bit more color? Are these just product extensions, brand new products? How should we be thinking about that?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah. I mean I know it's a bit of a teaser and there's always the desire to get a lot more detail in there. Obviously for competitive reasons, we need to be a bit quiet on that. I can tell you that it's a very exiting product line as... is across flow generators and masks; some of them will be line extensions and some of them will be very different fundamental platforms.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then sorry, one last one for Brett: I didn't catch the U.S. and OUS flow generating or mask growth rates?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. For the U.S. flow generators, the increase was 24%.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay.", "Brett Sandercock", "And mask and other was 22%.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, thank you.", "Kieran Gallahue", "All right, thanks, David.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please go ahead.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hey guys congrats on a great quarter here. Thanks for taking my question.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, thanks Jessie (ph).", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Just... can you just make couple of comments about the market in general? I know there were concerns about sort of the U.S. obviously the economy and clearly your numbers don't show that. But maybe just talk about what's going on dynamics in the market right now?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. The fundamentals here are that we remain in a market that is 80% to 90% untapped, right? So, depending on where you are in the world, we are still in an education phase. We are still in the phase of engaging and endocrinologists, cardiologists, primary care physicians. So, fundamentally underlying this business, nothing has really changed from that perspective, we continue to drive awareness and continue to try to grow the pie overall.", "The big question has come to us certainly over the last nine month is what's going on the economy; is anything happening on the marketplace. And is there some evidence of some sleep labs having bit of a slow down, yeah, I mean, I think we've seen that probably over the last six months that some sleep labs are doing extremely well, some are being hit a bit, and they are slowing down of patient volumes.", "But it doesn't appear to be dramatically impacting the market anyway. Our view is that it still appears that the market is certainly growing in double-digits and historically, we've said it's been about that 15% plus or minus a few. It's probably still around that, maybe 14% plus or minus a 2. But it's still quite strong and the fundamentals remain very much intact.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. And then just internationally, I know a lot of other people are having trouble in France and Germany. You guys mentioned that those kind of seem to be all right, you grew constant currency 10%. So, again things are okay. But can you just comment through the environment there, is there anything changing over that affects you guys?", "Kieran Gallahue", "No. I mean look, markets are always dynamic and you are always trying to stay ahead of them. And each of those countries has their own special dynamics that's going on in a given quarter. The fundamentals really haven't changed in any of those areas, we had said, we thought we'd see some improvement this quarter, in fact we did see the improvement, we expect it this quarter.", "Underlying that no dramatic shifts in the way that governments are looking at sleep. And again, I'll say it's very much similar to the U.S. in the sense that it's about education, it's about getting into the co-morbidities about engaging more healthcare practitioners. So, I think fundamentally, there is just... there's more similarity than differences.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great. And then just quick one for Brett, and I'll get back in queue here, basically. Can you just breakout the actual revenue numbers for U.S. flow generator masks, OUS, I know you gave growth rates, can you just break that out?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, Kevin, normally we've just given the growth rates, but we've got in Americas the flow generators around, actually pretty balanced around the 61.4 million mask, and accessory 61.1.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Okay, great. Thanks very much. Congrats guys.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Germany. Obviously, the performance overall looks like it improved a bit here in international markets. Can you just... can you narrow in on Germany and maybe tell us what growth rates are doing there and how your outlook looks over the next several quarters?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. As you know, we don't get into growth rates individually by countries, but I can say that from sort of a flavor, both France and Germany have been doing quite well. The fundamentals in those market places really remain strong.", "As you know, we are both a homecare dealer and also we have a wholesale distribution business there. So, they have their own dynamics around when you see improvements in leading indicators versus when you see the improvements in revenue. And quite frankly, we have seen improvements in both. So, I think the team in Germany is executing quite well. There has been some changes in some of the ways that inventory is handled in Germany over the last several months. It's not a massive change the way we do business. It's just sort of the ongoing changes that you see in Germany. And it seems every year there is some tweak to the system. No, I mean the business looks good there. Team is really doing a great job in both Germany and France, and we remain optimistic.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "And with that change in inventory, would you expect any impact this quarter or should we anticipate just directionally not percentage wise, directionally that that business continues to improve?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, I think that we are going to continue to see in that business as we'll continue to see improvement in execution. I don't think there is going to be any fundamental change because of what's going on the inventory perspective. It's really not that big of deal over the marketplace.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Okay. And then thinking bigger picture as you work on the referral channel, we always struggle to figure out what percentage of patience were coming in through the cardiologist and things like that. But what other steps can the company take, relatively cost effectively to try to push that and obviously you can't put a sales force in place. But the things you're going to do above and beyond liberty and some of the other historical initiatives to try to accelerate that and are you going down that path?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, look we spend a lot our time and energy in trying to determine how we can and executing our plan to grow the marketplace. And a large part of that has to do with creating the push and the pull within the cycle. When you look fundamentally what's going on in the marketplace, you've got a few things that are coming together. One is you have excellent clinical data that continues to be available and continues to be published in the voice of the more co-morbidities, right? So, these are articles, these are papers that are in journals that are meaningful to a chronologist or cardiologist.", "I know that there is paper out today in this month in chest that's talking about cardiac surgery, and if you use CPAP following cardiac surgery that you can expect improved outcomes. I mean that's just news that we crossed the wire today. So, those are very important leading elements in educating that population. Now internally, we have groups that are specifically focused on how we can get the word out to those various healthcare providers, and how we can do it in a way that helps them cost effectively treat their patients. A good example of that is a group that we have in home sleep testing.", "We are working very closely with our sleep positioned partners and trying to help them understand how they can leverage home sleep test in United States. At the same time, we are begin approached by just as our competitors are being approached by many other types of players in the health care channel, be they primary care physicians, be they independent diagnostic testing facilities et cetera that are piloting at this point home sleep testing, right? And their part of the way, they're providing enablers for these healthcare providers to get engaged in the process of identifying and diagnosing these patients.", "We have efforts in continuing education, medical education units, where we are either working with partners to help provide them content, so that they can pay for these as well as funding someone on our own. Many those things are not oriented towards ResMed alone there, you're growing the pie, but when you have as much of the market as we do, it's very cost effective and the right thing to do. We continue to drive our public relations efforts, in order to keep sleep disorder breathing and the news.", "So, it is a... there is no silver bullets here. It's about executing everyday, it's about having a strategy that you focus on, not just in the short-term but the long-term and you hammer at it, you hammer at it, you hammer at it, and we continue to do that.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Okay. Thanks Kieran.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Please proceed.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "All right, thanks very much guys, great results. Actually, just I guess, following on from the question about the U.S. market. Could you perhaps just characterize what you are seeing happening with market share, perhaps what's the success you are having with some of the large distributors, and maybe if I could just throw in anything you are seeing on home diagnosis as well?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. So, the U.S. market continues as I mentioned before to have a number of very positive things that are affecting it. Obviously, we do have some levels impacting the economy, but because we are so under penetrated, it's just very clear that we continue to have some very positive momentum in that marketplace. I am sure whoever in this business are not trying to sell big iron to hospital, I can tell you that.", "From a market share perspective, we released the Easy-Breathe technology just about a year ago, right? It was basically this quarter last year, and it's been a very successful product introduction, technology introduction that has allowed us to gain share over the past year. We also... the team has been executing very well. We've had a series of new masks. I mean, it was basically a year ago, this month that we released the Swift LT as an example. So we've had some stiller products that have come on the market that have helped us along with execution in gaining market share.", "With that being said, we have very worthy competitors. And the competitors I think have also done a good job. I think we've been very fortunate to be able to chip away of that market share, and we certainly appreciate the business that we've been awarded, because of those good products and our hard work at the customer level.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "I was just going to ask... maybe just with... for instance is that still growing perhaps above what your underlying market growth would be?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, I'd say certainly the U.S. number, we grew about 23% this quarter. That's certainly would be above market growth this quarter. I don't...", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Right.", "Kieran Gallahue", "We certainly gain share.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Yeah. And is there a large part of that coming through from... just I guess maybe otherwise decided the contracts still maturing for you?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, look, as we say every quarter, we don't talk specifically about any given customer, but certainly large customers such as the Abrio (ph) we continue to have very strong relationships with. And we're doing quite well with them, and I think they appreciate what we provide and we certainly appreciate their loyalty. So we continue to make strides and good strides with those large customers.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "And just home diagnosis, just any update or any sort stepping stones you're seeing there?", "Kieran Gallahue", "On the home sleep testing?", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Yeah.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, home sleep testing... one of the things that we were... we we've been saying is that last year was sort of a year of clarity, right? We'd said that home sleep testing is here to stay and there is lots of back and forth on the NCDs and then clarification of the LCDs and going out to other insurance providers.", "And this year is the year of piloting; and it's quite frankly, it's been rolling out exactly as we'd expected it to. There are pilots that some of our sleep position partners have engaged in. We're seeing independent diagnostic testing facilities in particular, which the guys that have made a living on for instance doing O2 saturation testing and doing logistics for that. They get paid about 15 to $24. They've built a business on it. Now there's an opportunity, where maybe you can make 150 to $250 on a sleep test. So you might imagine they're extremely excited about it, and they're testing out their models of implementation.", "We've seen HMEs that have begun to get engaged in this. We've seen other types of docs. So this year's playing out as we expected it, which is this is the year of piloting home sleep testing. And we'd expect that to continue throughout this calendar year.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "And then 2010 start to see more roll out?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, I think you'll see a ramp over time. The inflection point, nobody's got a crystal ball. So you don't know exactly when the inflection point's going to hit. But every quarter that we continue to see these... this expansion of piloting says that this is moving beyond early adopters, and it's getting statement that's required for the general marks and that's good, and that's very good.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Thanks very much. Great results. I'll get back in queue.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, great. Thanks, Andrew.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, good afternoon. This Jim Orith (ph) for Jason.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Hi, Jim.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right. It's Jim. I know... coming up against the tough comp in the U.S. from the S8 launch last year, I know you don't want to give specific product launch guidance, but over the next 15 months of deposit you see are there going to be any significant new U.S. products?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, yeah, you're right. We are annualizing some of those product launches and yes, we will be seeing over the next 12 to 15 months products that are global. So U.S. and across the globe that will be as I said across both the masks and the flow generator lines, there will be... some will be line extensions and some will be total platform changes. So it's the whole game. And I do appreciate you realize that those are teasers and you'd always like more information. But really for competitive reasons, we just... we feel uncomfortable going beyond that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. My next question is thinking about the mix shift that's going on in the U.S. and thinking about more high end devices being sold, what do you think is driving that in the United States?", "Kieran Gallahue", "I think there's a couple of things that are involved here. One is there... some of the larger customers in particular I think have recognized the strength of using appropriate technology in the treatment of these patients and the fact that when you use autosetting technology that it is in many cases will help support compliance to the patients, and they don't get paid unless they have compliant patients and it helps to maintain compliance overtime, because it adapts as the patient adapts.", "The customers are more and more recognizing that the value of the patient is not just in that initial setup, but rather it is getting the patient compliance and having an annuity stream over, literally in some cases could be decades, because these people that are being diagnosed are frequently in their 30s and 40s, And we don't cure sleep disorder breathing, we treat it and they recognize the revenue streams from that.", "So adaptive therapy changes with the patient and they see that. But really this whole... it's fascinating this whole move by CMS to key on compliance, to say that there is a stick that comes along with not maintaining compliance on this patient as well as the obvious karat of having an annuity stream, and that's getting a lot of players to look more closely at what it requires to get those patient compliant.", "A large part of it is masks, it's one of the reasons why our masks, which are market leading, very simple used and very, very comfortable continued to be very well. But it also says, that on the flow generators if they can reduce labor, simplify the process of getting people compliant and then actually adapt with them, so that overtime you can maintain compliance; this is the way to build the business and it's very encouraging to see the evolution of thought.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right, thanks a lot.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Securities. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities", "Thank you very much for taking my question. Could you give us an update on competitive bidding?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. So, what has been released so far is that, in fact competitive bidding will go through, so no real surprise there. That it's been reduced by one MSA. And that we would expect, I guess towards the end of the year, October timeframe that we should start finding out how it rolls out.", "So, not a lot of surprises there. What's interesting from a field perspective, in fact I was just with number of our senior sales team just yesterday and was just getting an update on what's going on, what's the buzz in the field around competitive bidding. It's just very dissimilar from what we saw a year ago.", "Year ago, there was just a lot of angst around what we are gong to do, how we are going to do on the part of the customers. This year, there is a calmness about it at this point in the marketplace, because people have been through it. I think they recognize that there was already 9.5% taken out of the pricing in the beginning of year, so there is going to be a bit more rationality I think in the marketplace. So, it's every different feel than it was last year.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities", "Okay. And, could you comment on your uses of cash. I mean, so far you've been using it for share repurchases. Anything else you might have in mind?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. Yeah, I mean, let's say over the last 18 months, we've used about a $135 million to buyback our shares. We continue to think that that's a good investment. And so, as we still have some approval of shares that are remaining. We'll be finishing up the building and in this kind of environment, we keep our eyes open for a potential M&A or investment and technology kind of opportunities. So, we are very actively keeping our eyes open. But I will say, we are going to also be very careful not to let cash burn a hole on our pocket. We will do, we have always done, which is we will be very cautious, but very open minded when we look at opportunities in marketplace.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities", "Okay. And then finally, can you comment on price, it's interesting to me that, it wasn't that long that we were talking about the market moving more and more towards lower priced products and with the introduction of better products from you guys, the market is shifting back towards higher price products.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, you're absolutely right. But if it is to show that all crystal balls have a little bit of fuzziness to them. But this is a case, where I think that it's some of the fundamentals, have really been recognized by the market as I was mentioning before.", "This whole focus on compliance that CMS is driving is, really wonderful, because when push comes to shelve (ph) that's we're all here for, right? We are here for patients, we are here to help them manage their disorder, and nobody gets helped unless they're compliant. And the more parts of the channel that get rewarded by being the highest compliance oriented firms and that includes HMEs in the industry, then we all went, because most importantly, the patient wins impairs recognize that.", "So, overall pricing in the marketplace, I think it's sort of in that normalized range now. We always say there's sort of that 3 to 5% decline in an annual basis. You always see some high-end features that has a bit of more a law in it. I'd expect we're sort of in a steady state zone right now, it's a good place to be.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Securities", "Sounds great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Hi, Kieran. If you can just... has there been any coverage on the insurance front with respect to lead testing extending coverage in circle?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes. So, we continue to see movement particularly on regional basis and piloting. So just as you see several different types of business models, I mentioned IDTFs, I mentioned certain HMEs. And of course, most importantly to out certain sleep docs, which have been piloting opportunities in home sleep testing.", "You also see some of the insurance providers on one side having come out with coverage decisions, most all of which favors some form of the use of home sleep testing, some type IV devices, some type III et cetera. Most of them are less restricted for instance, even at CMS.", "But you also see them regionally trying to figure out how to drive more activity to home sleep testing. It is not yet broad scale, it is truly piloting, for an example you see on a regional basis some, one firm I am thinking of is sending letters to many of its physicians that are very engaged in having recommendations for sleep test, saying: I'd like you to consider home sleep testing as part of the mix.", "So, there are cases where they are actually getting actively engaged. I think what they going to have to do is, this is why that you are the pilot, even the insurance companies are going to want to figure out the best way of implementing it, and they're going to test their way through, which is great. Because, as they do that, they can roll it out, they can roll out the most efficient programs across the nation. And therefore, it has the opportunity for success, and therefore for long-term impact on the business.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "I think this also on about half of the U.S. was probably coming for home sleep testing. So, they have the mood to the insurance doing their products and so forth.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "All coverage; that number go up, I think to a month.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes. See, there is well over half the lives in the United States now can be covered or they could use home sleep testing. Again, depending which insurance you have there are different requirements, some want a type III, some want a type IV device, some want you to go to sleep docs, some want you... you can go to any treating physicians. So, it really varies, but that's, I think it's very natural sort of in the beginning of this type of transition. And I suspect over time that we'll see those things converge. So, yeah, I mean mine net is, I think it's where we expect to be and it's very positive.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Okay. Another question for Brett, you gave us some rest of the world (ph) split up for flow generation masks in constant currencies. Can you give it to us in actual, what the actual growth rates were?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, the headline international.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Yes.", "Brett Sandercock", "Flow gens was minus 5 and some marking accessories is minus 8.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "And SG&A was basically flat in the last quarter. Is that entirely related to the foreign currency, type of foreign currency movements or is this some addition sort of savings going on in the cost base?", "Brett Sandercock", "No, I mean that the flat result on the headline basis is pretty much the currency; and if you strip that out and you look at the constant currency terms, the SG&A increased by 13%.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then just last on 9.5 % cost cut that went for Medicare, how much of that has ended up and borne by yourselves and how much for the delays?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, first of all, the DMEs clearly get all of the impact, right? And it's just a matter of your negotiations with them. How much they do pass on or don't pass on. Remember when you go back a year ago, we were sort of at the tail end of some activity in the industry where there was quite a bit of price taken out of the industry from the supplier perspective, from our perspective. So there was really a lot of price movement ahead of that. And I think that's part of the reason why at this point, we were still sort of in that, more normalized environment of the 3 to 5% on an annualized basis.", "Alexander Smith - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks Kieran.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Securities. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, guys this is actually Benson on (ph) for Michael. First question for you guys in terms of your R&D spend, I think this is the third consecutive quarter, where you guys had the constant currency?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Hello. You're still on? Tania, it seems like we might have lost him.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question will come from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. Brett, it's a question for you, the gross margin guidance that you've given. We've clearly seen the LT development about quite significantly in the last little while. I just want to understand what assumptions you've made in giving that guidance range.", "Brett Sandercock", "I mean we've looked... on the forecast, we've looked at obviously bring the currency being a little bit higher than if you look to the average for the key around that sort of 66, $0.67 mark. And as you know the, you already know trying closer to mid 70s. But in terms... so we haven't really taken that into account, but while assigned that really... you're looking at a lag impact. Anyway, I remember we spoke about that two or three quarters ago. The benefit is lagged by inventory has to roll through manufacture and warehouse and then ultimately sell it. So, there would be some lag impact there anyway. So whatever the currency was, four, five, six months ago, what it is flowing through into Q4 for example. A sustained level of like that, we'd be pretty comfortable in the 70s to be frank. But that would have an impact that we'll been seen several quarter down the track.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So given the guidance range of 60 to 62 in 2009, you would be comfortable with where the dollar is now that you're still going to be in the range. Is that what I am to understand?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah I mean, we don't want to give guidance long way down the track. There's a lot of volatility and there is a lot of things that'll change. But if you look at it and look at the initiatives that we are undertaking in supply chain, in manufacturing, for example Singapore, in terms of product development pipeline, a lot of these will impact meaningfully in FY10. So we won't necessarily have a currency impact and I am confident we are definitely working on initiatives that can improve the margin with that currency.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "That's really helpful, thanks. And Kieran just a question SAIMI (ph) can we get an update on, I know you had the product with number one last around but also if could touch on that and then also touch on the big picture opportunity where you expect to or when you expect to bring those products into other markets?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. So the question is on the ventilation of course, on the volumes and all. So we can't express of course -- we continue to make progress with the let's call the SAIMI business of ResMed Paris business. We - a couple of quarters ago I think you're referring to we had a launch of the VS-III which we had sort of announced a few months early and it took our lucks a little bit in Q2.", "We have been shipping that product now. The product's doing quite well in the marketplace, it's received well. So we're feeling that we continue to make progress in that product range. And we look forward to continue to make progress on it.", "As far as when do we expand and I think in particular people are interested in when do we expand it into the United States marketplace; that really hasn't changed too in the proceeding months. We will not be - we do not plan on taking the current product series into the United States. We do plan on when we come out with a totally new platform, that's a couple of years hence.", "So we're not giving any specific dates on that but when that comes, that would be what we would expect to be the product introduced into the marketplace in the U.S. So in the foreseeable future, looking over the next 12 months, I wouldn't be building in any entry into the U.S.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Right. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Dan Herron (ph) with UBS. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning gentlemen. I just want to ask about the uptake of order machines in the U.S. and sort of magnitude change of its own I mean on our coming back couple of years all ways popular there now. So, as a rough percentage of sales what do orders represent in that market?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, in the U.S. mix what would you say next, would you run that business or what would say in the U.S. rough percentages for generics?", "Brett Sandercock", "The order of 20 % customers the growing significantly this quarter year-on-year and I think the whole segment is growing and somewhat our share taking there as well, given some of the changes Ken talked about.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yeah, so that's up from where we were few years ago, 12% obviously we don't have the ventilators and what not in that mix so it keeps up pretty strong, so that's a good movement overtime.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And to put you on the spot, can that continue to grow at that rate, the next sort of 12 months, or will it back off?", "Brett Sandercock", "We certainly don't try to predict on that sort of line item level. I think its obviously hard to but I think we can do is go back and talk about the fundamentals of the drivers. The fundamentals driving it are desire for the adaptive therapy.", "Also the fact that these kinds of products are the ones that we interface with the Regis tracks data center both the Elite products as well as this product we do have in fact even the Escape II. So we do have a number of products which can interface but this in particularly as a very convenient product and its one that supports driving of patient compliance at a time when the HMEs are very sensitive to the fact that compliance means getting paid alright.", "And so I think fundamentally while that continues and there is no suggestion of that backing off quite the opposite we may see other insurance companies which put in similar requirements overtime. I think that the fundamentals that drive these higher data oriented machines as well as the ones that support patient comfort and therefore health compliance are going to naturally play a more important role, all right. So we're not at the level where I think we want to predict exactly what percentage of flow generator sales. But the fundamentals remains strong and I don't see that changing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "okay. So in other words with, you're not talking percentages to drive this of the order switch up far from over?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Exactly.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You Bet.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kennedy, with Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Brian Kennedy - Jefferies & Co.", "Hi this is Brian here for Peter. I want to ask about the clinical data, specifically can you talk a bit about the European AFE study, what the timing of the data release is and what are some of your goals and when you have the data, something it's positive?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. So your question regards to the hard failure studies that we're engaged and its multinational, multi-site, heart failure study, we call survey chip. And it's the use of adaptive servo-ventilation in heart failure patients, Class 2, 3, and 4, heart failure patients and the end-point -- primary end-points are mortality and hospitalizations, and there's a whole series of secondary end-points.", "Adaptive servo-ventilation is a very unique product that, and it is very dependent on how you applied specific algorithms. And our algorithm which has been designed and tested over multiple years over thousands of patients is extremely robust.", "The study itself began last year. We continue to recruit like most clinical studies, you always have hope this things to go off like a shotgun and be then used on the recruitment side, and like normally you go through all your bumps in the beginning. But we've been actually have seen a nice improvement in recruitment rates over the last X number of months.", "And we're hearing of some very positive results both in those studies but also in some patients and, lets call it sister studies that also use adaptive servo-ventilation, where we've seen, as an example, of Class 4 heart failure patients which have been released from hospital and have been... have seen their health significantly improved, in fact they've been down graded from Class 4 down to Class 3, heart failure, I mean its just really, really dramatic improvements in some of these cases.", "So, these are multi-year studies, you shouldn't expect to see data from it, certainly not in this calendar year and then may be a bit of time after that. In fact before you even see some interim reports, that's the nature of these studies. But we're pleased with the progress to-date and particularly we're just pleased at the use and the understanding, and the acceptance of use of the ATS II product which is what we call it there in heart failure.", "And in fact, if you look at Japan as an example, where we have two distributors there selling the product under different brand names. And you look over the last year, one of the most impressive growth categories for us very significant has been the use of these adaptive servo-ventilation products by cardiologists, and in fact its been the cardiologist who are directly engaged with the patients in these cases. So, a very different model over there but indicative of the potential of this area so we remain extremely excited about the benefits that we can bring to that very costly commodity and the role that adaptive servo-ventilation can play in that.", "Brian Kennedy - Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks. I appreciate the response.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kieran Gallahue, for his final remarks.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Great. Well thanks, Tanya. Well thank you all for joining us today and as always, I want to thank our employees our ResMed employees all over the globe in various functions, has clearly been their stellar efforts to drive ResMed's performance. We are to some of our people and I am very proud of that team throughout the globe.", "We remain excited about our future, we've got high margin, exciting new products rolling our of the next 12 to 15 months, we've got a stellar balance sheet which in today's environment is something to be both proud of and very comfortable with. We've got significant operating cash-flow and as I mentioned an absolutely first rated team with strong execution.", "So, we've got lot of the things going on in the industry, a lot of good things going off the company and I look forward to update you again next quarter.", "Thanks everybody.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentleman, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator instructions)", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projection of future revenue of earnings, new product developments or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which maybe accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thank you. Well, good afternoon and welcome to ResMed's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call.", "As with our previous calls, I'm begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO to go through the numbers in more detail. We will then both take your questions.", "Well, as any of you that have seen the press release, you know the we had another very solid quarter and a phenomenal year that once again demonstrated the power of being a well balanced, geographically diversified company with a well accepted, high quality diverse mix of products.", "We are pleased to report the global revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 grew 7%, or up 15% on a constant currency basis. Revenue growth in the Americas grew by 20% year-over-year.", "ROW revenue declined by 4% but in constant currency terms grew 10%. As expected, currency had a significant effect on ROW revenue. For the year, we are approaching that billion dollar mark with 921 million in global revenue. GAAP EPS increased a remarkable 55% to $0.59. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was $0.02 better at $0.61.", "We projected that we would be able to grow gross margin and are pleased to report that gross margin improved over 62% in Q4, benefiting from the depreciation of the Australian dollar from last year's highs, and increase in sales of our higher margin masks, sales of high-end flow generators as well as continued success in leveraging cost efficiencies across our global organization.", "Again we had very strong performance in operating cash flow, which came in at $70.2 million demonstrating our commitment to strong operating performance and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong with the cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q4 of about $416 million.", "We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generators up 8% or 17% in constant currency, and mask segments growing at 6% during the quarter, an 11% increase on a constant currency basis.", "We saw significant growth in the profitable segments of our flow generators. Globally the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, especially the S8 AutoSet II and VPAP Auto 25 where we had a big advantage in both noise and in comfort.", "Our Easy-Breathe technology is now available across the entire sleep device platforms from CPAP to APAP and through to our VPAP SV devices. The whisper-quiet comfortable performance of Easy-Breathe is truly being recognized as best in class. Easy-Breathe technology has set a new standard in the industry and it's helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved comfort and reduced noise.", "Sales of America\u2019s flow generators were up 22% year-over-year in Q4 and sales in ROW improved to 30% in constant currency terms. As a result of changing product mix in the sleep device category towards higher-end technology, our gross margins are improving. There continued to be tremendous interest in our wireless compliance technology, ResTracks GSM. We still remain the only company that provides wireless transfer of sleep apnea data to an Internet system.", "Once again we posted double digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter and continue to increase market share. We believe we are taking market share in both the new patient population and the installed base. Mask sales grew 18% in the Americas and in constant currency terms grew 4% in ROW. Mask sales in the Americas were strong across all product lines, with our full face masks, such as the Mirage Quattro contributing significantly, but also Mirage Activa LT, the Swift LT and Swift LT for Her doing particularly well. With their ease of use they are some of the best selling masks in the marketplace. As a reminder, these redesigned LT masks are smaller, lighter and more streamlined versions of their predecessors.", "The Swift LT for Her product fills a gender need and space not addressed by other companies. We listened to the voice of the customer and we responded. And the Activa LT is a less obtrusive mask, which gives patients superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients. With these new masks in the global marketplace, we remain focused on growing market share with high margin industry leading products.", "Looking forward over the next 12 months, we plan to launch a series of new masks and flow generators. In July as promised, we introduced the ApneaLink Plus, our type three home diagnostic device that will meet the existing reimbursement and physician requirements.", "As we have been saying this year, we will be watching home testing carefully throughout 2009 and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms. It was proven that HST was here to stay in 2008 and in 2009 as we expected, multiple healthcare providers began piloting HST in various models. We are working closely with our sleep physician partners to make home testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy.", "We also expect growth to result from continued and improved awareness in validation of the critical role that sleep disordered breathing plays in a very serious, most rapidly growing and most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.", "Although sleep disordered breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders and races it is becoming widely recognized that heart disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand in hand with sleep disordered breathing, and treatments for sleep disordered breathing can not only improve health, but dramatically lower medical costs associated with these populations. I think that point deserves more thought and consideration.", "It is well known that government and payers across the globe are looking to reduce healthcare costs, while improving outcomes. Let us remember that NICE, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, which is the UK health economic experts, just over a year ago, released the results of their evaluation of sleep disordered breathing.", "The net outcome, NICE concluded that it is economically advantageous to identify and treat patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing. Given that countries around the globe are looking to develop similar healthcare economic analysis arms, many based on the model that NICE established, this bodes well for ResMed and for the sleep industry moving forward.", "We also know that sleep disordered breathing can have a dramatic effect on presenteeism as well as absenteeism and represents a significant opportunity with occupational health and safety in the transportation business for diagnosis and treatment of sleep disordered breathing. As a matter of fact, there was the story just recently that pilots on a Go Airlines flight from Honolulu overflow the international airport by 50 km last year because the pilots fell asleep.", "The US National Safety Board confirmed an initial finding a few weeks ago that the captain and first officer inadvertently fell asleep, while the plane was on autopilot. The board said that the contributing factor was the captain's previously undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea. This focus on occupational health and safety and the comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are still in their early days of impact. The data is compelling and we have not yet began to feel the full impact on this industry.", "This market remains highly under penetrated, a fact that bodes well for the future growth prospects.", "Now I will turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the financials and then we will take your questions. Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Kieran. Let's briefly run through our June quarter results. As Kieran mentioned, revenue for the June quarter was 252 million, which is an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter.", "As expected unfavorable currency movements reduced our fourth quarter revenues by approximately 17.3 million. So in constant currency terms revenue increased by 15% over the prior year quarter.", "Income from operations for the quarter was 57.9 million, an increase of 57% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was 45.4 million, an increase of 53% over the prior year quarter.", "Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.2%, up sequentially from Q3, reflecting favorable currency impact, and traction from our manufacturing and supply chain improvement initiatives.", "Our fourth-quarter gross margin now reflects the full benefits associated with this initiation of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar. As you look forward, should the more recent appreciation of the Australian dollar be sustained, we will have a negative impact on our gross margins over the course of fiscal year 2010. However, subject to further currency volatility, we still expect our gross margin to be broadly in the range of 60% to 62% over the course of fiscal year 2010.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were 77.6 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. The flat price in headline SG&A expenses reflects the impact of the depreciation of international currencies against the U.S. dollar. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11% over the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved to 31%, compared to the year ago figure of 33%. Looking forward, and again subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 31% to 33% for fiscal year 2010.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were 17 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. The lower R&D expense reflects the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar as the majority of our R&D expenditure is denominated in Australian dollars. In constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 14% over the prior year quarter. R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was 7%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the 7% range for fiscal year 2010.", "We continue to devote significant resources to product innovation and clinical study activities.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was 1.8 million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was 6.6 million. During the quarter, we also had donated 2.5 million for the ResMed Foundation.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, and we estimate our fiscal year 2010 tax rate to be in this vicinity of 27% as well.", "Turning now to revenues in more detail, overall America\u2019s sales were 134.2 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks with strong contributions from our high-end CPAP and IPAP devices, our new range of bilevels and Swift and Quattro mask ranges.", "Sales outside of the Americas totaled 117.8 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. As expected sales outside the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particular depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 10% over the prior year quarter.", "If you break those revenues up by product segments Americas flow generator sales increased by 22% while masks and others increased by 18%.", "For revenues outside the Americas and in constant currency terms, flow generators increased by 13% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 4%. On a global basis in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 17%, while masks and other increased by 11%.", "Cash flow from operations was 70.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and improved working capital balances.

There is approximately 4 million in payments remaining on the building and they should be paid during our first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled 14.9 million.", "We continue to buyback shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 349,000 shares, a consideration of 13 million as part of our ongoing buyback program. For fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares at a cost of 65.7 million. During the June quarter, our board of directors authorized a share buyback program for up to 10 million shares and this buyback program replaces our previous program. As of today, we have repurchased 79,000 shares out of the new total approved buyback of 10 million shares.", "ResMed ended fiscal year 2009 in excellent financial shape. Revenues for the year were a record 920.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year or a 15% increase in constant currency terms.

All right, operator, why don\u2019t we start the questions? Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis. Please proceed.", "Joshua Zable \u2013 Natixis", "Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter here, and great year. Thanks for taking my questions, and thank you for officially making me afraid to get on an airplane ever again. Just a couple of quick ones, just the first a breakdown of revenues, I know you gave it on constant currency, but can you give us just the numbers there for flow generators and masks?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure, Brett, you want to answer that.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I will break it down. For flow generators in the US, it was 69.7 million; the rest of world was 79.6. And for masks other in the US 64.5, and the rest of world 38.2.", "Joshua Zable \u2013 Natixis", "Great, okay. And then just one follow-up, just on the market in general, obviously clearly you guys are taking share. I know your competitors haven't had quite the success you have had, and I know Kieran you kind of brought up some things that we have heard you talk about before; obviously it seems like it is getting more awareness. The market growth has been pretty solid and stable. Is there a sort of sense that there is the kind of reenergy here in the market that the market kind of maybe is reaccelerating in any way, shape or form or is this really a lot of market share gains, and we're just kind of steady or still growing [ph]?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Well, I think you know, the market has remained healthy all during this time period when so many other industries have suffered incredible challenges. That includes many part of the healthcare business. You know, we haven't seen a dramatic change in the business. Early in the January timeframe, we said that maybe there is a couple of points that were carved off the market or so. We are seeing that basically flat. We are seeing a lot more interest and talk about increasing capacity. We are seeing a lot of excitement about the comorbidities.", "And in areas for instance, with home sleep testing we are seeing the pilots begin to play out just as we expected. And I think that is creating a general excitement about this area, and a recognition that this is the kind of market that even in difficult times still has the ability to be growing in double digits. And I think that that has opened the eyes of many of the players in the marketplace, has given them comfort and given them renewed energy. So I think there are just a lot of good things that keep happening in this marketplace.", "Joshua Zable \u2013 Natixis", "Great. Well, congrats, I will get back in queue here.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thanks. And by the way, you should also feel uncomfortable on the roads because truckers have it at even at a higher rate than pilots.", "Joshua Zable \u2013 Natixis", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. Just a question about \u2013 along the similar lines. I guess with the economy being tough and hospitals particularly investing less, we see signs that investments in sleep lab beds have slowed down. I was just wondering if you see similar signs, and whether you're seeing that impacting on market growth?", "Kieran Gallahue", "You know, we didn't see or feel anything different this quarter than we had in the last quarter. And from that perspective, I would say that there is not a lot of change out there. What you are saying is that there is an increased emphasis on, for instance, HME\u2019s part, where they recognized the ability to monitoring the installed base. As things get difficult across-the-board what they look for is where the growth opportunities are. And this is the same thing that happened three years ago when oxygen in neb-med reimbursement got cut, and suddenly everybody recognized that the sleep market has been underserved.", "So what you're hearing from HME is a renewed emphasis on looking at compliant users, making sure those compliant users are appropriately followed up with, that to the extent that they deserve have accessories and masks, to the extent that their payers will support the patients in those, that these patients should be better served. So there is multiple ways of growing a marketplace. Some as the fundamental diagnostic capacity, some of it is how you use that capacity in other words, the mix between split nights versus a dual night studies. And finally there is the means of mining that compliant user base, and I think that we are seeing customers in all those cases focus on getting more from what they have.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks very much. This is another question, national contracts and movements there, is there something else we are trying to break out, and I know you don't want to comment on particular contracts, but could you give us a sense as to whether there were any changes there that had any influence on this quarter?", "Kieran Gallahue", "No, I think you are right. I don't think it is useful to break out by customer type. We are doing very well across the board. We have been working very hard not only from a product perspective in bringing innovative technologies to market, but also whenever possible making it easier to do business with ResMed, because we believe that helps support the goals of the HMEs and improves their profitability and perhaps most importantly helps them improve patient care.", "You may have different techniques from time to time, but the same underlying fundamentals work with both the independents and with the nationals. And so as a result, we are seeing wins in all categories.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking my questions.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alex Smith with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks guys. Just \u2013 maybe a question for Brett on the gross margin outlook for 2010, you said 60% to 62%. So if it hits a headwind, are there offsets that you are thinking about to arrive at that number as well from the cost side?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, Alex. This is Brett. Definitely, basically as we have been saying for a little while now, we're working a lot on the cost side, and on the cost of the business, and there is many \u2013 not just a silver bullet, but across \u2013 basically right across the board on many initiatives. And the expectation really is that those ones will start to kick in and mitigate any of the currency headwinds that we will have as we move through the fiscal year. So if you think about Singapore manufacturing for example, some work on logistics, on their freights and warehousing, materials purchasing. New products, obviously as we roll through the fiscal year, will have an impact, and then overlying that we have a continuous improvement program, which had excellent engagement down here in Sydney. So it is a combination of all those factors that makes us confident we can \u2013 that they will actually expand the margin, even though that currency will obviously be a negative for us.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, terrific. And maybe for Kieran, can you give us any idea of whether that will be new product launches during the next quarter?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So we're not going to get into that fine into details for obvious competitive and customary reasons, but let me just say then that the next 12 months is going to be an incredibly busy 12 months, and we will be busy even before the end of this calendar year. So this is going to be a very exciting year for us across both masks and flow generators.", "Alex Smith \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, terrific. Thanks for that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Great, Kieran, maybe just following up on that last question, can you characterize how significant a change kind of the next-generation platforms from you, and if you can to some extent your competitors will be versus where we are. Are we talking about a modest improvement in technology or there is something more dramatic we can point towards?", "Kieran Gallahue", "And you are talking flow generators or are you talking masks?", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Primarily generators, but if you want to comment on masks that will be great.", "Kieran Gallahue", "well I think that there are opportunities across the board. I obviously cannot speak in detail for my competitors. That will be questions that are better targeted towards them. I will say as an industry overall, there is still a lot of innovation to be brought to bear in this marketplace as the technology continues to progress and some of that has to do with the use of informatics, and how these devices, these therapeutic devices fit in not only as a therapeutic device in and out of itself, but also as a node within a system of care. There is \u2013 and you can kind of get a feel for that with, for instance, the ResTracks data systems and the continued evolution that you would expect to see with those informatics systems.", "I think there is continued opportunity to improve on noise levels, on algorithms that are applied to patients in order to improve comfort or either reduce or deskill the labor that is applied. And I think those are important points by the way, because if you look at health care across the globe and what we seeing certainly over the last decade is that health care systems are trying to contain costs and in part by either reducing the amount of labor applied or deskilling the labor that is supplied in the care process. And they are also trying to move people out of expenses settings into the home settings. Both of those play to half strength, and there is innovation that could be brought to bear that simplifies the administration of the therapy and making sure people are compliant, while increasing the efficacy. So there is a significant amount of opportunity for us to continue to innovate in multiple ways.", "On the mask side of the business, it is still about how do you make it easy for the care providers to set the product upon the patient, how do you improve the comfort, the immediate comfort and the long-term comfort of the patient. How do you improve the efficacy through managing leak, and how do you wrap that whole thing into a system cell. And then finally when you look across both of those platforms there is opportunity for bit of Moore's Law, where we can improve the functionality while addressing the cost of goods. So we're going to be hitting on all those cylinders as we go through this year.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Maybe just one other question on generators, you talked about mix being very positive for you, can you characterize where we are as a percent of mix as we look at the different, maybe three or four different broad areas, and you have even often talked about present auto setting in the past, where maybe is that now?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So when you look at from a percentage perspective, I guess we can look at it from a number of different ways. We continue to be under penetrated in the bilevel category, and we have an incredible platform that is underpinned by the Easy Breathe motor technology that makes our devices far quieter, in some cases up to 90% quieter, while being more comfortable for the patients. So the first thing is major mix shifts within that. We have a significant opportunity for continued growth because our products are simply market standard and it has been an area that we have been under penetrated in the past.", "We do see continued growth on the Autoset side of the business, and even the Escape II, where we have put in additional functionality with the EPR. So we're seeing it across the boundaries, and we are comfortable with the growth in each of these categories, not only from what we have achieved to date, but with further penetration in the future. As far as specific percentages on the mix of Autosets, Brett do you have the current figures on that.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, it is probably in the order of 25%, somewhere around that mark. Certainly, Autoset continues to be the strongest growing category.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. And is Europe still kind of a 60ish, or has it moved higher as well?", "Kieran Gallahue", "That has been more of an autosetting market. It is probably around that, about 60% to 70% mark.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "And then last question, I will hop off. If you think about the 10 MSA that are going to be bidding in October, have you guys looked at what percentage of the market that might represent and then what the next group of MSAs that bid in the eleven might represent the market, and how we might anticipate lead through?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes, I think first of all I think it is 9 MSAs now. They eliminated Puerto Rico. So I think \u2013 it is clearly a minority of the marketplace as far as what percent is covered directly by that. I couldn't give you the percent, but it is a small percent of the total market. I think more than anything else when you talk to HMEs, many of them feel that the last round of competitive bidding was just so poorly implemented that the likelihood of this being implemented well is a challenge and many of them feel that, even to the extent that this delayed process, because it is obviously been delayed again, right? Or it was delayed several months ago, and that redelayed, but delayed several months ago. That there is a feeling that if it is not administered properly, and if there is a significant push back from the community that it may make full rollout of competitive bidding very challenging as well. So I think there is a lot of water to go under the bridge before we forecast what the impact of that will be or won't be.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Thank you.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Bye with Jefferies & Co. Please proceed.", "Peter Bye \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Hi. Thanks guys. A couple just on the home sleep testing, I mean you mentioned airlines and truckers, what is the \u2013 for some of these occupational groups to develop models for sleep testing instead of sending their members to sleep labs, are you hearing anything there. We notice the Aetna CareCore National deal here in New York sort of a trial there. And I think (inaudible) is playing around with it too. Is there anymore color you can see about programs going on out there?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure. I would look at those two things independently, although one can be supportive of the other. There is the opportunity in occupational health, which is certainly not dependent on HSD coming in, but rather the entire marketplace has the dynamics that is associated with HSD, which anything that lowers the cost of diagnosis and simplifies it, will not only help it in the occupational health area, but it will also help in all aspects, whether it is looking at the comorbidities, whether it is looking at you garden variety, sleep disordered breathing patient. So if we segment those two different things there are a number of companies, HMEs or start-ups that have tried to focus on the occupational health category, and there is no doubt that the introduction of HST has us even more excited looking at different models, because particularly those categories of transport workers where there are moving to a different location every night.", "The idea of a mobile screener if you will, a mobile diagnostic tool certainly makes diagnosis even more simple, and so there is a number of start-ups that we have heard about out there or other HMEs that are looking to get engaged in that process. And that is good. The more noise there is, the more opportunity to address the big players and transport more likely that we will get to a tipping point sooner.", "With HST overall, just sort of general update on that, we are the one who said that the last calendar year was the year that really was established whether or not home sleep testing was here to stay or not. And clearly from the fact that CMS and the largest payers have jumped on board with it, it is very clear that home sleep testing is here to stay, and it is just a matter of how it rolls out and the speed. This year as we have said is the year of the pilot. And it is really working out the three Ps. It is looking at the pricing. So what are people going to get paid from their different payers. What are the processes? So how do different healthcare providers integrate home sleep testing into the way that they do business, and what are the various flows associated with that. And the last one is politics, which is, what is the interaction among the channels, among the different physicians. And that is always the hardest one to predict the timing of when that is going to play out.", "We have heard of, we have seen a number of pilots that in fact have started as we have anticipated and they range from HMEs to sleep physicians to primary care physicians to independent diagnostic testing facilities. So you have a number of different players that are testing the three Per share, if you will, of home sleep testing. And they are using a variety of devices. Certainly many are finding the simplicity and cost effectiveness of ApneaLink and ApneaLink Plus is very convenient for them. And there are other solutions out there, which is fine because what this is all about is opening access to the markets.", "So our intention as we go through this is to continue to support our sleep physician partners and the sleep community and our long-standing relationships, and be able to do the best we can to help them provide quality patient care and open up access to more patients. So it is moving and it is moving right along the pace that we had anticipated.", "Peter Bye \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, and then a couple of more. Just on Washington, what are you hearing from your DME customers in the sense of compliance mandates for follow-up with the physician, risk of not getting that and not getting paid by Medicare. How much panic is there among some of the guys or the smaller guys on accreditation? Is that going to affect on October 1 if at all, and any thoughts about any interim cuts in 2010, until we get competitive bidding starting in 2011?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, the major buzz is in a couple of categories. One is with compliance monitoring, and you know that ruling, which came out almost a year ago now. That is when the starting gun went off, and that is when we started to see a huge up-tick in interest for the ResTracks GSM and in some of the higher-end systems that work particularly well with ResTracks GSM and also help support patient compliance.", "So, I think the community has reacted or we saw the first wave of reaction to that and what they realize is that with all those data that they now need to manage and with the importance of gaining compliance, I think there is a renewed emphasis on compliance, and that this good for the patients. That is good for the industry. That is certainly good for ResMed because of the nature of our products. And because this is a chronic disorder where people are treated for decades, every patient that can be captured that can be \u2013 that we can keep compliant in those early days represents a long-term annuity stream and good health care. So this renewed emphasis, I think the HMEs have sort of taken it on board. They are taking the actions. It is leading to very good conversations at the field level \u2013 to act as consultants in the selling process, and we have the technologies that can help make them more successful.", "The other buzz from the Washington side there is just a lot of interest on HMEs really around oxygen. That is where the primary emphasis is. There is a desire to keep oxygen out of the competitive bidding to remove the 36 month cap. So, there is a lot of action. Their focus tends to be more on the O2 side, and I think there is a greater level of comfort and security on the sleep side, because they know that it is a highly under penetrated market and in any case represents significant growth opportunities.", "Peter Bye \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, and just one last follow-up, the VS-3 [ph] ventilator had sort of the first full quarter I think on the full supply that you have, and you know, any leverage on the H1N1 stuff going on, especially overseas?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, VS-3 is a great product and it is doing quite well. As far as bump up from the flu, no, we're not seeing at this point. We are hearing a lot of discussion around it, obviously as you know with the \u2013 it is mainly the southern hemisphere at the current time and there is the expectation that it could quite a spread in the Northern hemisphere. At this point, we are not seeing any thing like bumps we got out of bird flu and that sort of thing. Not yet.", "Peter Bye \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, thanks, guys.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Please proceed.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Thanks for taking my call guys. I was just going to ask just in terms of Singapore, what sort of percentage of volume do you think that is going to start contributing in the 2010 year?", "Brett Sandercock", "Andrew it is Brett. If you look say FY09, it is probably in the order of 10% to 15% up there. I think as we move through fiscal 2010, it is probably more like the order of 20% to 25% of the total. So it certainly will progressively ramp up through the fiscal year, and there is a meaningful amount there now. And that will build, and obviously that will help us on the manufacturing or cost front. The other thing it does is it also diversifies a little bit out of the Aussie dollar. To the extent the [inaudible] there has been seeing dollars. We need a little more position now, the Aussie a bit stronger in terms of our cost base. So for example the Singapore dollar over the last three months was up about 3%. If you compare that to the Aussie, which was close to 50, you can see there is quite a bit of difference there. So that decision to diversify risk mitigation et cetera is also going to support us on the cost base as well.", "Kieran Gallahue", "I say we have been very pleased with the ramp up of the Singapore facility, and also want to note that we remain very committed to our facilities down in Australia. We have got fantastic employees down there. We are in a very fortunate position with the growth in this market and the growth in volume, and that we can remain committed to a given geographic region, and at the same time have the ability to expand elsewhere.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Can I just \u2013 just looking at rest of world masks, there were sort of 4%, can I just ask you characterize how we should be thinking about those?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes, I mean, you know, the ROW masks tend to grow at a slower rate than you will see in the US. And it tends to be a little bit lumpier. In this case we had some pretty challenging base year comps. So I just think it is sort of a timing issue.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Okay. There is nothing particular regulatory changes in your paying countries or anything?", "Kieran Gallahue", "There are zero fundamental changes.", "Brett Sandercock", "Just to put the tough comp in perspective, I think we grew 30% the year before in that category. Kieran said that it tends to be a little bit lumpy.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Okay, terrific. Thank you very much. I will get back in the queue.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Adams", "Thanks guys. Congrats on a good quarter.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thanks.", "Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Adams", "Kieran, I will start with going back just to your commentary about the US market, sorry if I missed it, I am bumping between calls. Just wondering what you saw in the first half of this calendar year, the last half of your fiscal year, as it relates to US market growth, and it is hard to tell what Respironics is doing, specifically I suppose, but obviously you guys gained share, and I'm just wondering sort of what you are looking for going forward in terms of market growth here in the United States?", "Kieran Gallahue", "By all indications, the US market continued to grow in double digits. We saw probably in the January timeframe as we discussed earlier, there might have been a bit of a tick down, maybe a couple of points, but we haven't seen that regress any further than that. This last quarter felt very similar to the quarter before that. So that was a very comforting feeling that we are in good shape in the marketplace.", "I think you are right. I think we're gaining share. I will say we still have very worthy competitors. I think Phillips is a very strong competitor and one we respect and think that they are good for the industry. We have been doing well both at large customers and smaller customers, and I think we are benefiting from a couple of things, I think both very significant differentiation in our technologies both on the mask and the flow generators side and that is something I think we will see continuing through the new product launches that we have in the next 12 months. And I think just fundamental execution at the field level.", "Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Adams", "Thanks, got it. So as you look forward over the next two or three quarters, you're looking for market growth in the US in that double-digit range. You guys also are going to be comparing against some really nice quarters in the second half of last calendar year. At the same time you're planning to launch some new products which I'm sure you hope will sustain your growth. So, could you maybe discuss the juxtaposition of the difficult comps with the new products launching relative to where you are sort of expecting the market to grow, and I guess the bottom line is do you continue to expect to gain share or hold your share during the time you're competing in some earlier quarters last year?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes, I mean you know that we never talk in you know, single quarters because one of the things that we are very adamant about it not managing a business quarter-to-quarter, and I think that gets very dysfunctional over time. So, you know, let's talk about the way that we always talk about things, which is we look over the next 12 months, we look over the next 18 months, et cetera. Do I think that we have the ability to continue to gain market share? You bet. Do I think that we are in a market that's going to continue to grow in the double digits? You bet. I think that we're in very good positions. No doubt, you're right. We've got certainly tougher comps coming up than we had in the past and I think that you know, that's recognized and that's a good thing. You know, keeps the sales force focused, and we continue to enjoy the benefits of those wins that we have had in the past.", "Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Adams", "That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Couple of just follow up questions. I'm wondering what your thoughts are and update as it relates to comorbidities and typically what you're doing or thinking about in terms of partnerships to explore further comorbidities with sleep disordered breathing?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Well, you know, the blessing and curse of being involved in \u2013 and being a leader in the sleep disordered breathing marketplace is that it seems we overlap with every with every costly comorbidity on the planet. You know, whether you're talking about heart failure, whether you're talking about diabetes, whether you're talking about drug-resistant hypertension, whether you're talking about obesity and our ventilation business, we are square in the middle of COPD. You know, so the opportunity is enormous. But life is about execution and execution is about focus, and so we are \u2013 we try to be relatively disciplined about how we approach each of these comorbidities and they are at various stages of development.", "You know, some of them where the knowledge, let's say in hypertension as example, it's well known and understood ever since the JNC seven guidelines that sleep disordered breathing is a major cause of hypertension and treating the sleep disordered breathing can bring down blood pressure. Now, we still have education to do, and I think you'll see a much greater focus on primary care physicians in the coming year as we help them understand sleep disordered breathing and we work as an industry to help them understand sleep disordered breathing, and the role that CPAP can play in treating that.", "You have other comorbidities where we are at a little bit earlier stage. The data is fantastic, but we probably have even more opportunities for education. So, you know, we try to balance the investment. We try not to try to, you know, bore the ocean all at once, but we try to focus, use partnerships where it is appropriate, use internal business development resources when it's appropriate and then we get to critical mass stage, we spread it out to the sales force to try to strengthen relationships with their contacts. So, you know, it's a matter of having the opportunities but focusing specifically where we think the best pay back is.", "Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Adams", "It's helpful as well. Last question from me, Kieran. Trends in the market as it relates to you mentioned your customers are focusing on mining their customers, and I'm wondering if you've seen any change in trend as it relates to patients using masks. I think the last time we asked it was still hovering around one mask per patient per year, notwithstanding the reimbursement for more than that. Wondering what you guys are doing to drive that higher and whether or not we've seen some benefits from anything you're doing to do that.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes, so I can answer that mostly from an anecdotal basis and then I can from a specific number which is, you know, it is always very difficult to get out anyway just because of the ability to segment replacement from new user masks, but the \u2013 but in our dialogue with our customers and their request for things like drop ship directly to patients and their request to support their resupply to learn about how to set up resupply initiatives. What we feel very comfortable in saying is that the HMEs continue to increase their focus on that very valuable segment of compliant users, and you're also seeing new players get in to the mix, who may have let's say previously focused on other disease states that see the opportunity in sleep, and may have particular skill sets and direct consumer marketing as an example that are trying to stimulate greater use. You know, I think we talked down in the last conference call, in the last six months you started to see direct consumer advertising on TV for compliant users. I mean, that is just an indication of what's going on in this industry, and when you have one player that's doing that I can assure you that the other leaders in the industry look at that and try to understand how they either defend against that or leverage that \u2013 those kinds of activities to stimulate their own growth. So it's a good sort of dominoes affecting dominoes process, where the HMEs recognize the attractiveness of serving the compliant users.", "Jason Mills \u2013 Canaccord Adams", "Great. Great quarter, guys.", "Kieran Gallahue", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, may I also say great quarter. Couple of little things, capital expenditures in 2010 now that you've completed the new facility in San Diego, what might that be?", "Brett Sandercock", "Joanne, it is Brett. With the Aussie dollar appreciation in Euro, it will probably be around when I look forward about 12 million to 15 million a quarter on CAPEX and it will be predominantly operational CapEx because we have as you know, finished out a booming cycle.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, is there any way to quantify of the 62% gross margins a quarter, how many basis points came from foreign exchange? You can start trying to peel away the onion a little bit to understand it.", "Brett Sandercock", "I mean, if you look at that there's a lot of factors that impact the margin, geographic mix, product mix, FX, manufacturing efficiencies, et cetera. If I look at sequentially, manufacturing efficiencies or improvements in logistics and so on, and FX had a similar impact and those were the key drivers.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, so just sort of take the improvement sequentially and divide it in half?", "Brett Sandercock", "Well, they are the key drivers. We have slightly better product mix, slightly worse geographic mix and, you know, ISP were always there, but the two big drivers were FX and then the manufacturing efficiencies or improvements.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, helpful. Thank you. Res products have recently had a recall. Is there anything you can comment on that and what it may mean for your position in the market? Did you see anything from that in the quarter?", "Kieran Gallahue", "You know, we've heard buzz, but you know, one of the things where we ask our sales force to be disciplined and focused on positive selling, and focus on the benefits that our products can bring to market. So, you know, it's not something that we talk about a lot and it's not something that we promote within our commercial organization.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, will we be seeing some of your new products at Medtrade this fall?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Maybe. It was a great try Joanne. Great try.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, just sort of related to Joanne's question. I think last quarter you all said that you saw a net $0.05 positive impact on your EPS from currency. I was wondering if you could quantify what the overall impact from currency was this quarter.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes, Michael. It was pretty strong this quarter. I estimate in the order of $0.10.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then with regards to the increased compliance documentation requirements from Medicare, are you seeing that from other private payers as well, and then sort of a follow-up to that what happens with the CPAP units, when patients are not compliant or they don't go back to check in with their doctor after they've been using it and the HME isn't able to collect all the reimbursement. Are they able to pull those products back and put them back into service?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, with regards to the first question, we are seeing some interest but I'm not hearing about it any broad scale adoption of changes in the compliance monitoring world. With regards to what are they doing with the units, they've always had a certain amount of units that have come back and they usually \u2013 different players use them differently. Some of them put them in loaner [ph] pool so that they can have \u2013 use them with the initial patients, and then once they are compliant they'll put out new units on them. So some of them sort of have these loaner pools they use during the introductory phase, some of them donate to charity.", "I mean, there is a lot of different uses. I think the key emphasis on this though, what the HMEs are really driving towards is improving compliance, and so I think that this regulation, although certainly none of the HMEs would necessarily ask for it. I think what their finding is that there is a significant unintended benefit or maybe it is intended benefit. Let's give it the benefit of doubt that there is more emphasis on compliance, and that it appears that there may be an improvement in compliance, which means you'll have less units coming back anyway, and you'll have better long-term prospects with these compliant users.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, and then you know, your cash is now more than 10% of your market cap, and I guess just doing some rough math of 10 million shares that you have been authorized to repurchase would eat up pretty much all the cash you have right now. Can I infer from that that you're not going to really be looking at acquisitions, or are you active kind of in the business development area, and are there things out there that you could actually buy that would fit with your business model?", "Kieran Gallahue", "So, I wouldn't directly associate either our gross or our net cash position with \u2013 entirely be in the buyback. I mean that's certainly one use of cash and obviously we've \u2013 if you look over the last 18 months we've used that $140 million in cash buying back shares. So it's certainly one of the uses of cash. You know, are we looking at potential acquisition targets or investment in various forms. Absolutely, we always do that and, you know, one of the things that we changed organizationally a year ago is we went to a strategic business unit structure that allows us to look at the way that we develop and acquire technologies in a different way, and that certainly opens up the avenue for us to be a bit more proactive in our sort of appearance or the way that we look at different opportunities.", "I would say this though. We remain disciplined and one of the strengths I think of ResMed over time has been the fact that cash does not burn a hole in our pocket that we do not go out and try to chase the next deal. We are in a very, very attractive under penetrated market. We are market leader within that segment and so our thresholds for looking at acquisitions is quite high. You know, we want to make sure that it either helps us in our core business or represents a significant upside growth opportunity, and we are rather disciplined when we look at those things. So it's not going to burn a hole in our pocket. The feel that we are in a very strong financial condition. It holds us in great stead during the times when other companies may feel challenged and we feel good about that.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And then, just one quick question on the guidance ranges that were given on your operating expenses, did those include your stock-based compensation expense, the SG&A in particular the 31% to 33% I think as well as the guidance?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, they do.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, thanks.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Simpson with RBS. Please proceed.", "David Simpson \u2013 RBS", "Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. Look, I just want your impressions of the potential for US healthcare reform and then the impact of that on ResMed going forward?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Sure, I mean I think it's anybody's guess at this point what kind of healthcare reform takes place. I mean it'll be hard to believe that there will be no legislation in the area and the question is just how far-reaching it is, and what the both the intended and unintended consequences of that are. I will say that I think we feel ourselves well positioned, whether or not healthcare reform comes through, and the reason is when you look at the fundamentals of what we do, we are sitting in the middle of a metabolic syndrome and sleep disordered breathing touches on the most costly chronic disorders in the planet. And so whether you're talking about diabetes, whether you're talking about heart failure, whether you're talking about COPD with our ventilation business, we have the ability of providing very cost-effective care, and, you know, what are they trying to do is we discussed earlier today, you know, healthcare systems across the globe have been trying to either eliminate or deskill labor in order to take cost down and they're trying to take people out of costly care settings such as the hospitals and put them in lower-cost settings, and guess where that is.", "That's the home, that's the most cost-effective way of providing care. So, we are I think very, very strategically positioned, regardless of which side things come down on, and you know, I mentioned before the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, and nobody would disagree I believe that the NHS is probably one of the most frugal healthcare systems in the planet, and they were certainly ahead of the curve in the establishment of National Institute of Clinical Excellence to look at a health economic situation and to make sure that there is an economic balance in the care process, and I think it's very important to note.", "I mean they came out with a study after looking at the data and said it is cost advantageous to identify and treat more people with sleep disordered breathing. So the extent that you know, prepared effectiveness comes out let's say to the extent that that is based on the NICE standards, which you would imagine at least in part it would be. To me that bodes well. So you know, we are not so concerned about the whole changes that are forecasted here. You know, could it put more people into the system? You bet. Is that a benefit to us? Yes. Could it be more focused on cost controls? You bet. Do we position ourselves very well as a category that helps control costs in the healthcare systems? You bet. I think we are at a very unique and a very well positioned part of the industry.", "David Simpson \u2013 RBS", "Thanks for that and just as a follow-up, just like a bit of color I guess in terms of the rest of the world, you know, the relative performance of Asia versus EU in the quarter?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Yes. So, for us, Asia-Pac represents 1% to 10% of our business and it tends to be a very lumpy business. So quarter-to-quarter trends are really hard to pick out. If you look at over the last year, you know, not talking about any given quarter it was very, very good, strong growth and you know, we tend to still be dominated first by Japan and second by Australia and New Zealand, and the other markets though they certainly represent significant long-term upside, opportunity remains on the smaller side.", "David Simpson \u2013 RBS", "Okay, thanks guys very much.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You bet.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for closing remarks. You may proceed.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thank you. And thank you all for joining us as always and as always I also want to thank all of our employees across the globe in their various functions because ResMed is a collection of its individuals acting as a team, and we have fantastic team members in all the functions and across the globe and these results, these stellar results are really a result of their efforts and their dedication to patient care. I can say that we are excited about our future. We've got high margin, exciting new products rolling out over the course of the next year. The market for our sleep disordered breathing is still highly under penetrated. New policies approving the use of home testing are going to reduce the barriers for accessing patient care. We've got a stellar balance sheet, significant operating cash flow, and as I mentioned an absolutely first-rate team to assure and focus on execution. So thank you very much, and I look forward \u2013 and we look forward to updating you as the fiscal year 2010 progresses.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the ResMed Incorporated Fiscal First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions).", "", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the Company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may accessed through the Company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran T. Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thank you Marsha and good afternoon and welcome to ResMed's First Quarter Earnings Call.  I am certainly glad that we\u2019re having it today and not competing with the New York Yankees and Joe Burke and the World Series celebration tomorrow. ", "As with our previous calls, I will begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to go through the numbers in more detail. We will then take your questions.", "We had another very solid quarter and we\u2019re pleased to report that global revenue in the first quarter of 2010 grew 13%, or up 16% on a constant currency basis.  Revenue in the Americas grew by a very encouraging 19% year-over-year.  The rest of the world revenue increased by 8%, but in constant currency terms it grew 13%.  Europe and Asia Pac sales were quite solid this quarter.  As in previous quarters currency had some effect on ROW revenue. ", "GAAP EPS increased a remarkable 53% to $0.55 per share.  Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles EPS was a penny better at $0.56 per share.  We projected that we\u2019d be able to sustain gross margins in the 60% to 62% range in the face of the strengthening Australian dollar and we are pleased to report that gross margin was in fact 60.8% in Q1 benefiting from favorable product mix due to an increase in sales of our high margin masks and high-end flow generators as well as continued success in leveraging manufacturing and logistics cost efficiencies across our global organization.  ", "Again, we had a very strong performance in operating cash flow which came in at $64.1 million demonstrating our commitment to strong operating performance and earnings and a commitment to working capital control.  Our balance sheet remains extremely solid with cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of Q1 of around $478 million.", "We also experienced balanced growth across product categories with global flow generator sales up 12%, or up 15% in constant currency and mass segments growing at a robust 15% during the quarter, a 17% increase on a constant currency basis.  ", "Sales of Americas flow generators were up 14% year-over-year in Q1 and sales in ROW improved to 15% in constant currency terms.  Globally the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, once again led by the strong sales of our AutoSet category where we have a big advantage on noise and comfort.  The whisper quiet comfortable performance of Easy-Breathe is truly being recognized as best in class.  Easy-Breathe technology has set a new standard in the industry and is helping to differentiate ResMed from our competitors with improved comfort and reduced noise.", "Once again we posted double-digit growth in the mask segment globally during the quarter and continue to increase market share.  We believe we\u2019re taking market share in both the new patient population and the install base.  Mass sales were extremely strong this quarter and grew 23% in the Americas and in constant currency terms grew 8% in ROW.", "Mass sales in the Americas were strong across multiple segments, including excellent progress with our Mirage Quattro Full Face mask, our Mirage Activa LT nasal mask, and Swift LT and Swift LT for Her nasal pillow interfaces.  With their ease of use they are some of the best selling masks in the marketplace.  As a reminder, these redesigned LT masks are smaller, lighter, and more streamlined versions of their predecessors and the Activa LT is a less obtrusive mask which gives patients superior performance and potentially fits 90% of all patients.  With these new masks in the global marketplace we remained focused on growing market share with high margin, industry-leading products.", "To add to our offerings of small lightweight masks we recently launched the Swift FX nasal pillow mask in Europe, our lightest mask to date.  We also just launched our first ever gel mask with the Mirage SoftGel.  We showed the mask at Medtrade and have had a fabulous response both at the show and in our early days of the market.  ", "In October we announced that we acquired Laboratoires Narval.  Based in France Narval manufactures and distributes the Narval ORM, an innovative mandibular repositioning device that offers a solution to patients for snoring and mild obstructive sleep apnea.  With this acquisition we add another therapy to complement our existing positive airway pressure based solutions.  In the near term we plan to commercialize this device primarily in France where it is presently the only device with established reimbursement.  Over time we will evaluate other markets and expand into other geographies as it makes sense.", "Last March we indicated that we would have a very active 18 or so months of product launches.  As you can see from the past few months we are well on track to meeting that commitment.  As noted earlier we began taking orders for the SoftGel mask in the US during October and we\u2019ll commence product shipments, in fact we have commenced product shipments, in November.  In addition, we launched the Swift FX in Europe during October.  We expect that each of these products will be launched on a global basis over the course of the remainder of this fiscal year.  Additionally, in July, as promised, we introduced the ApneaLinkTM plus our type III home diagnostic device that meets the existing reimbursement and physician requirements.  ", "As we have been saying this year, we will be watching home testing carefully throughout 2009 and expect home testing to be piloted in various forms.  It was proven that home sleep testing was here to stay in calendar year 2008 and in calendar year 2009, as we expected, multiple healthcare providers began piloting HST in various models.  We are working closely with our sleep physician partners to make home testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy.", "We also expect growth results from continued and improved awareness and validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays in the very serious, most rapidly growing, and most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  Although sleep disorder breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders, and races, it\u2019s becoming widely recognized that hear disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand in hand with sleep disorder breathing and that treatments for sleep disorder  breathing could not only improve health, but may also dramatically lower medical costs associated with these populations.  We also know that SDB can have a substantial effect on presenteeism, as well as absenteeism and represents a big opportunity with occupational health and safety in the transportation business for diagnoses and treatment of sleep disorder breathing.  ", "It seems almost sadly routine that we hear of airline or trucking mishaps that are linked to sleep issues.  In addition, just recently the US National Safety Board stepped up its campaign to test all drivers for sleep apnea.  The NTSB has written to the US Coast Guard and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration recommending screening for all pilots, bus, and truck drivers for sleep apnea.  The NTSB recommendation follows a string of transport accidents in which sleep apnea was identified as a factor in driver and pilot performance.", "Finally, as part of our strategy to improve awareness of sleep disorder breathing in the physician community we are embarking on a series of branded and unbranded medical education programs.  In fact, we just announced the collaboration with Phillips to support the sleep communities efforts to educate primary care physicians funded with educational grants.  This is just a part of our continued commitment to raising the awareness of the dangers of sleep disorder breathing within the medical community.", "In summary, Q1, once again, demonstrated the strength of our global reach and balanced business while providing very positive signals for sustained industry growth and ResMed growth as we look forward.", "Now I will turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional detail on the financials and then we\u2019ll take your questions.  Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Kieran.  I will just briefly run through our September quarter results.  Just to recap our revenues for the September quarter were $247 million, an increase of 38% over the prior year quarter and as expected unfavorable currency movements reduced our first quarter revenues by approximately $5.3 million.  In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 16% over the prior year quarter.  ", "Our income from operations for the quarter is $52.7 million, an increase of 44% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $42.1 million, an increase of 50% over the prior year quarter.  ", "On a diluted earnings per share basis for the quarter it was $0.55, an increase of 53% over the prior year quarter.", "Our gross margin for the September quarter was 60.8%, down sequentially from Q4 \u201809.  We did benefit from favorable product mix, but this was offset by unfavorable currency impact and some unfavorable geographic mix.", "Looking forward, the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar will have a negative impact upon our gross margin, however assuming current exchange rates we still expect our gross margin to be around 60% for the balance of fiscal year 2010.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $76.8 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter.  In constant currency terms SG&A increased by $0.11 over the prior year quarter.  The increase in SG&A reflects expenses to support sales growth as well as activities targeting the increasing awareness and diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing.  SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved to 31% compared to the year ago figure of 33%.  Looking forward, and again, subject to currency movements we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be broadly in the range of 31% for the balance of fiscal year 2010.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $70.9 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter.  In constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 9% over the prior year quarter.  R&D as a percentage of revenue was 7% compared to 8% in the prior year quarter.  Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the 7% range for the balance of fiscal year 2010. We continue to devote significant resources to [inaudible] innovation and clinical study activities.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $1.8 million for the quarter and stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $6.5 million.  During the quarter we also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation.  ", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3% and we estimate our fiscal year 2010 tax rate will be in the vicinity of 27%.", "Turning now to revenues in more detail:  Overall Americas sales were $134.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter.  This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks with strong contributions from our high-end APAP devices, new range of bi-levels and the full-face masks.  So that side of the Americas totaled $112.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter.  As expected, sales outside of the Americas were impacted by currency movements, in particular the depreciation of the euro against the US dollar.  In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out the revenues between product segments, in the Americas flow generator sales increased by 14% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other increased by 23%.  For revenues outside the Americas and in constant currency terms, flow generators increased by 15%, while masks and other increased by 8%.  On a group basis in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 15%, while masks and other increased by 17%.", "Now cash flow from operations was $64.1 million for the quarter reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management.  In the next quarter our operating cash flow will be significantly impacted by an expected Australian tax payment traditionally made in the calendar fourth quarter; it should return to robust levels after that.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter was $14.1 million, including $4.3 million in completion costs associated with our new global headquarters in San Diego.  Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $14.1 million.  ", "We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program.  During the quarter we repurchased 789,000 shares for consideration of $35.7 million as part of our ongoing buy back program.  As of today, we have repurchased 994,000 shares out of a total authorized buy back of 10 million shares.  ", "Our balance sheet remains strong and conservatively at September 30 total assets stood at $1.6 billion and net equities $1.2 billion.

You\u2019ve seen that the last couple of quarters, we have had some strong performance and I just think the team has a lot of good things going for it right now.  It is executing extremely well.  The leadership teams under Stein Jacobsen and under Rob Douglas are both performing extremely well.  The product line up is very well suited to the marketplace and stacks up well from the perspective of competitive alternatives.  So, all in all I think it is no silver bullet here, it is not just one single item, it is strong performance across multiple geographies and we\u2019re feeling good about their performance.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay and then can you give us your take on, there was a launch by a competitor of yours and I\u2019m just wondering If you are seeing any kind of impact in the field from that and maybe your take on how you\u2019re line up stacks up against their refreshed line up.", "Kieran Gallahue", "You are speaking specifically about the launch of flow generator series by our primary competitor and so to date I am not hearing a whole lot.

I mean the updates that have been provided over the last year about how this thing is going to roll out; the fact that they have moved it from 10 MSAs down to 9 MSAs, just really there are no changes.  There is obviously a lot of activity at the HME level; they have been working on it for a number of months, although not a lot of chatter at if from a customer perspective.  If I compare this to two years ago and the amount of chatter when it was the first time through, I think there was almost sort of a feeling of panic.  This time it is much more of a businessman like sort of approach to it.  They kind of know the drill and they are going to go through it.

As you know those bills are all over the place and our feeling is you just step back and you look at it and you say what are the fundamentals that they are trying to drive towards and to the extent that there is an attempt to try to become more efficient in healthcare, the extent that there is a desire to increase the access to bring more patients into the system, both of those trends actually could be very positive from our perspective.  Certainly by increasing the number of covered lives, sleep disorder breathing is a disorder that affects people of all walks and all sorts of economic classes; in fact you could argue that those in some of the areas that they are not being covered today by insurance may have the highest prevalence rates.

They are also trying to deal with the rising costs of managing chronic disorders.

I mean, you can argue that the UK is one of the more frugal healthcare environments on the planet and they have some very good outcomes data as well.  The National Institute of Clinical Excellence has really been sort of the granddaddy of health economic bodies around the globe and 18 months ago they analyzed the sleep apnea space and their recommendation was that it was cost and official in order to identify and treat more patients with sleep disorder breathing.", "So, when you look at those kinds of indicators and you say if we move anywhere in the direction towards that level of frugality and then there is some common sense put in place as NICE has demonstrated, there could be some very positive aspects that come out of this.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joshua Zable from Natixis Bleichroeder.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "I know you broke out the US generators in mass on a constant currency basis, but can you give us the numbers for everyone\u2019s models?", "Brett Sandercock", "For the US the flow gens was $64.8 million, masks and other was $69.9; Tiger $34.7; for the rest of the world flow gens was $75.8; masks and other $36.5, for $112.3 total.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Perfect and then on the gross margin I know you gave a range, you sort of talked about 60%, just because I know there is a lot of stuff going on with gross margins as far as product mix and the new products higher and currency, I mean from this range should we sort of see it dip first and then come back up, should it be kind of constant over the year, can you just give us any color on how we should think about it?  I know you guys don\u2019t like to give quarterly guidance, but kind of moves it around a lot just to give us some sort of gauge?", "Brett Sandercock", "As you said there is a lot of things impacting on the geographic mix, the product mix, new product releases and so on and then obviously currency as well.  If you look at it, we get benefit from the euro, which has been appreciating at the moment, so that is going to help us and I hope it is on a headline basis in terms of revenue as well.   The Aussie dollar depreciating will hurt us also and that has been coming from a low, probably around six months ago, of about $0.66 and it has been steadily climbing through the quarters.  We felt some of that impact clearly this quarter.  We will feel some more of the impact through Q2 and it will still be manifesting in Q3 as well, but then I would expect that that would then start to improve as we went through Q4 and we\u2019re pretty much through those sort of year-on-year currency impact.

So there is sort of the temporary sort of things that are really hard to forecast and then there are the longer trend items that are quite positive for us.", "Brett Sandercock", "That is exactly right and we have been working hard on the cost initiative on the manufacturing and so on.  You guys know that we did move to Singapore, we established a factory there to enhance the factory down here in Sydney, so there is a lot of activity that goes on beneath the surface here that we\u2019ll continue to work on, really just a sustained reduction in that overall cost base and we will continue to do that and new products, obviously, will help as well.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Okay great and then Kieran I know you commented about the competitive launch and I know you don\u2019t want to knock the products and you made your comments already, but I am just wondering have you really seen them out there yet/  I know typically when Respironics launch it is some sort of limited release and I am just wondering obviously they are still sampling in that limited release, but have you really seen it out there yet to the point that your guys could come back and evaluate, or it is not really out there yet and it is just sort of trickling into the market?", "Kieran Gallahue", "I think, as you noted at Medtrade, I think they did an excellent job, as they always do, in trying to establish awareness about the new product flow and I\u2019m sure that transcends into the sales force and into their call patterns.  You are absolutely right that any product launch from any competitor or from ResMed for that matter, you go through a process where you get an initial trial and then the real question mark is after that initial trial what are your reorder rates like and then how does it stack up competitively.  At the same time you have sort of a push through of some of the older inventory that you try to make sure that you don\u2019t get caught with any obsolescence on that.

I think we all recognize that there is tremendous amount of value that is brought to bear and I won\u2019t limit that to Respironics, I will say that throughout the industry that there is a tremendous amount of value that we bring to customers and I think we all know that price competition is a short-term gain and that we all need to be focusing on higher value opportunities and how to reduce the costs to our customers.  You reduce the costs by simplifying their supply chain.  You reduce the costs by helping to drive more volume into the marketplace.

So, as we expected throughout this year there is going to be activity really across a wide range of customer types.  Seeing primary care physicians try their hand at it, the independent diagnostic testing facilities, or the IDTFs that are getting involved, sleep physicians, other types of specialists, so there are a number of different types of customers or healthcare providers that are getting involved in understanding what their role in home sleep testing could be, or should be, and you are almost seeing the first echo, if you will, in that process where there has been a learning and an iteration in it.  ", "What I mean by that is there are certain groups that seem particularly interested in it and I would say the IDTFs working with the HMEs seem particularly interested and capable of providing support and very encouragingly we see more and more sleep physicians, who we certainly enjoy working with in this category, who are beginning to understand the benefit of integrating home sleep testing along with their traditional diagnostic techniques.  And, you see many of the sleep physicians who maybe a few months ago, and I mean that literally, just a few months ago may have been quite reticent to think about the adoption are beginning to learn a bit more, experiment a bit more, and to gain substantially more comfort with the idea of home sleep testing in their professional hands being able to be administered quite well and in a quite balanced way.", "In addition, you are seeing more and more payers get engaged in this.  We, on a regular basis, get feedback from payers, local payers, national payers, of their interest in either supporting customers that have been working in home sleep testing or somehow encouraging the use of home sleep testing and much of this we get from feedback from the physicians themselves who have been working with those payers.

We hadn\u2019t expected it to be material and in fact is not material and that is sort of the way that you would expect these things to roll out, which is to have people gain comfort, understand the three Ps, process, payment and politics.  The process and payment have been progressing quite well.  Then as I note that the politics, which were probably a bit more intense six, nine months ago, are beginning to  ease a bit, but certainly by no means have disappeared and I wouldn\u2019t expect that to happen over night.", "So, good progress and I would say nothing has happened yet that is different than we had anticipated and articulated certainly earlier in the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Your Americas number is on supplier.

We will selectively look at opportunities to invest those dollars.  I think a good example of that was the Narval acquisition that we completed in this last quarter, which is our first sort of toe in the water and to a complimentary therapy to pap and one that we feel very good about and the execution of that French team, which by the way has already begun its integration; an excellent team and one that we welcome with open arms into the ResMed team.  We also had the opportunity to buy back our own stock and that continued too, as Brett noted, another $35 million was invested in this last quarter and that is on top  of a substantial amount of share buybacks over the last 18 months, because we feel that ResMed was a very worthy investment.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "With this shift in foreign exchange environment, does it make sense to change your head in policies?", "Brett Sandercock", "What has happened over the last two or three years is in fact volatility on exchange movements increased significantly really.

The majority is options, for example, where you are not impacted; you are not going to lose your premiums sort of thing.  We hedged the cash flows coming back to the factory and then we looked to naturally hedge a lot of our exposures around the group as well, just basically leveraging our global reach, I suppose, so we do a lot of that natural hedging as well.

Is there any risk that that could actually turn into a negative to the degree that those folks don\u2019t end up being compliant and the HME pulls that equipment back and then gives it to a new patient thereby trimming the demand for new equipment?", "Kieran Gallahue", "I think that the key here is that the opportunity for improving compliance has always existed.  What the Medicare ruling did was to focus the HMEs very strongly on the opportunity to improve compliance, and that is something that we have long wanted for many, many different reasons.  One, because that is the only way you help the patient, that is the primary reason.  We are here to help support healthcare providers in helping patients.  But, it is also good business because a compliant user obviously over time represents a renewal stream for many years of very high value products.

It is to be able to help those HMEs be more efficient in the way that they address the opportunities of improving compliance.  It is a management by exception tool.   So, we don\u2019t expect the challenges associated with the compliance to ever fully go away.  That is why HMEs play such an important role in the channel.  They are service providers and payers need to recognize the value that those HMEs are bringing to patients.

Many, many of the things that we do, regardless of whether it is Medicare or non-Medicare, because everyone has the same opportunity for improvement.  So,  whether it is ResTraxx and this fantastic management by exception tool; whether it is the Easy Breeze wave form and designing wave forms that are more comfortable for patients; whether it is EPR and having the ability to make the introduction to therapy more comfortable; whether it is the wide range of masks that we provide, everything from nasal pillows to full face masks; from liquid silicone rubber all the way over to gel masks now; it is all about making the experience better for the patient and we believe in the long run the healthcare providers, the payers, including Medicare, win in that process and the HMEs will win in that process.", "I think we think that the focusing that Medicare has done could always create a few bumps in the road, but net, net it should be a positive for this industry.", "Michael Matson -Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, so you see a positive factor of compliant patients replacing masks more frequently and also more sales of the ResTraxx units sort of offsetting a kind of negative factor of some patients kind of giving up their equipment and having that come back into the pool?", "Kieran Gallahue", "Look, first of all ResTraxx is an enabler, so it is not a huge revenue driver, or a profit driver. We provide that mostly as a service to our HMEs to help them become more efficient, but when push comes to shove in this industry it is about creating awareness and it is about engaging healthcare providers, including across all the various medical silos and right down to the primary care physicians and most importantly it is about providing the support to those patients, because when they get treated we all know, and the data has shown, that their healthcare costs get reduced holistically.  The improvements in cardiovascular disease, and the improvements in diabetes, we talked about occupational health and safety and the danger of these truckers when they are not treated appropriately.  We read about these pilots that over shoot airports like in the Go Airlines case.

But, we absolutely keep our eyes open for other opportunities, but we are data driven.  We look at these solutions and we want to see opportunities where it is demonstrated that it helps patients.

There has been substantial movement forward as various healthcare providers that range from IDTFs to sleep physicians, to HMEs, to primary care physicians, each of those areas have had certain players that have experimented or are experimenting with home sleep testing and over time we would expect the smoke to clear and there to be certainly more than one solution that will be in the marketplace that is associated with home sleep testing.", "So, it is progressing quite well.

Some of them are a bit more advanced than others.  We certainly have some of our customers which have said they\u2019ve been able to grow their business by using home sleep testing and the way that they are viewing it is, and again it varies by the individual, but is looking at many of the patients who, for whatever reason, may not show up at the lab, so they get a referral into the sleep lab.  A good 30% of those patients historically have never showed up.  ", "Clearly some of those people either are not showing up either because of the expense or because of the inconvenience associated with the over night sleep test.  70% do show up, but 3% is a big number and so you have some of those sleep physicians who are looking at that and saying hey, this is not a matter of replacing somebody who would have been in a bed anyway, this is a matter of getting somebody who we would not have been able to reach.  So, it is truly a new patient or an incremental patient that they wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach.", "In addition, what they are finding is that some of those patients, once they test them with the home sleep testing device, still require either because they are borderline, or because there is something very unusual about them, they still require a full PSG.   So, those are the ones that are getting more comfortable more quickly and obviously you\u2019ll have some of those faster movers in the marketplace and you will have some that will lag behind that and may take a bit longer to feel comfortable and may need to see the sleep physician across town and see how they have adopted it before they feel comfortable in the adoption phase.", "It is a very interesting process that they are going through, but the more data they get it seems the more comfortable they get.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jason Mills from Canaccord Adams.", "Jamar Ismail - Canaccord Adams", "", "This is Jamar for Jason.

There was a period there were it was accelerating and it continues to grow above market rates, so let\u2019s just call it a stable, continuing positive shift mix that we\u2019ve seen in this industry.  Again, I think that bodes well for the future, because many of these higher end feature sets are oriented towards patient comfort, which can improve compliance, and they are oriented towards the reduction of labor that \u2018s required by the HME or the sleep physician in helping patients get acclimated to their therapies.

We have high margin exciting new products that are rolling out over the year.  The market for sleep disorder breathing is still highly under penetrated.

My name is Jennifer and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions).", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the Company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor Provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may accessed through the Company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Kieran Gallahue, ResMed's President and CEO. Mr. Gallahue, please go ahead, sir.", "Kieran Gallahue", "Thanks, Jennifer. Well good afternoon and welcome ResMed's second quarter Earnings Call, as with our previous calls I'll be in with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO, to go through the numbers in more detail. We will then take your questions.", "Well, we are very pleased to report today that we just achieved an important milestone at ResMed by crossing the billion dollar mark in trailing 12 month revenue, and reporting our 60th consecutive quarter of revenue growth with another very solid quarter. We are pleased to report that revenues in the second quarter of 2010 grew 23% or up 17% on a constant currency basis.", "Revenue in the Americas grew by 20% year-over-year, ROW revenue increased by 27% and in constant currency terms grew 14%. In contrast to recent quarters, currency movement has a positive impact on ROW revenue this quarter. GAAP EPS increased 36% to $0.60. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was two pennies better at $0.62 per share.", "We're pleased to report that in the face of the strengthening Australian dollar, gross margins were 59.7% or approximately 60% in Q2 benefiting from the continued success in leveraging manufacturing and logistics cost efficiencies across our global organization, and offset primarily by the depreciation of the Aussie dollar. Cash flow from operations was $11.6 million, operating cash flow for the December quarter was adversely impacted by the  timing of the $61.7 million income tax payment that we mentioned would be forthcoming during our last quarter conference call. ", "We expect cash flow to return to robust levels as we continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong operating performance and earnings, and a commitment to working capital control. Our balance sheet remains extremely solid with the cash and cash equivalent balance at the end of Q2 just over $451million. We also experienced balance growth across product categories with global flow generator sales up 29% or up 21% constant currency, and mass segments growing at 17% during the quarter a 13% increase on a constant currency basis.", "Sales of America's flow generators were up 24% year-over-year in Q2 and sales in ROW, improved to 17% in constant currency terms. Globally the growth was mainly driven by strong sales of our high-end sleep devices, once again led by our AutoSet CS and BiPAP Auto, where we have a large advantage in both noise and comfort. The whispered quite comfortable performance of the Easy-Breathe continues to be recognized in best in class and is truly helping us differentiate ResMed as best in class from our competitors.", " In the mask category we believe we continue to take market share in both new patient populations and the installed base. Mask sales were quite robust this quarter growing 16% in the Americas and in constant currency terms 8% in ROW. Our newly launched soft-gel mask is off to an encouraging start in its early days and we've had a fabulous response from both physicians and from patients. We expect to continue launching various sizes in the Americas and broadening our launch to other geographies throughout this year. The market is telling us that they appreciate the value and the comfort of quietness that this mask demonstrates.  ", "", "The Swift FX the newest member of the Swift family and our lightest mask to-date launched outside the Americas during Q1 and has just launched in the Americas, so it is just now going global in all sizes, just as with the soft-gel mask the feedback has been outstanding. So with these new masks in the marketplace we remain focused on growing market-share with high margins, industry leading products. Last March we indicated that we would have a very active 18 or so months on product launches, as you can see from the past month we are well on track to meeting that commitment. Today we are officially announcing the release of our newest generation of flow generators, the ResMed F9 series.", "The initial introduction will be the F9 AutoSet and the F9 Elite products expanding to other flow generators over time. We expect the launch to begin first in Europe and then expand to the Americas later this quarter. We're extremely proud and excited about the unique advantages of the F9 and what they will bring to the market. The F9 will have a new look and feel that will integrate within the bedroom while delivering advanced and improved feature such as (inaudible) and heated circuit or hose for improved patient comfort, a simplified user interface, and an enhanced AutoSet algorithm, it is absolutely going to be an outstanding product. ", "A quick update on home sleep testing, the home sleep testing continues to be piloted in various forms. It is proven that HST was here to stay in calendar year 2008 and in calendar year 2009, just as we expected, multiple healthcare providers began piloting HST in various models. We're working closely with our sleep division partners to make home sleep testing a reality that can improve patient access to appropriate therapy. We've heard that a growing number of commercial payers are in discussions on recommending and perhaps even requiring HST as a first line diagnostic.", "We also expect growth results to continue to improve the awareness and validation of the critical role that sleep disorder breathing plays in a very serious most rapidly growing, most costly diseases in the world, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Although sleep disorder breathing affects people of all ages, weights, genders and races its becoming widely recognized that heart disease and diabetes particularly tend to go hand-in-hand with sleep disorder breathing and that treatment for SDB cannot only improve health, but also dramatically lower medical costs associated with these populations. ", "We also know that SDB can have a substantial effect on presenteeism, as well as absenteeism and will represent a large opportunity within occupational health and safety and the transportation business for diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorder breathing.", "Finally as part of our strategy to improve awareness of sleep disorder breathing and the physician community, we're embarking on a series of branded and unbranded education programs. As previously reported we are involved in collaboration with Phillips to support the sleep communities' efforts to educate primary care physicians funded with educational grants. This is just part of our continued commitment to raising the awareness of the dangers of sleep disorder breathing within the medical community. ", "So, in summary Q2 once again demonstrated the strength of our global reached and balanced business while providing very positive signals for sustained industry growth as we look forward. Our new product flow is robust and customer meaningful and demonstrates that our commitment to innovation is paying dividends.", "Before I turn over the call to Brett, I just want to remind everyone, or inform those of you who haven't heard, that we'll ring in the closing bell at the end NYSE on Monday February 8th. We'll be hosting an investor relations meeting at the exchange beforehand, if you'd like to attend or leave details, please contact Connie Bienfait, our Director of Investor Relations.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional details. Brett? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Kieran. So I'll briefly run through our December quarter results, revenue as mentioned for the December quarter was $275.1million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. We did have favorable currency movements that increased second quarter revenues by approximately $13.3 million. In constant currency terms revenue increased by 17% over the prior year quarter. ", "Income from operations for the quarter was $57.9 million an increase of 34% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $46 million an increase of 36% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 an increase of 36% over the prior year quarter.", "Gross margins for the December quarter was 59.7%, down sequentially from Q1FY10, largely attributed to an unfavorable currency impact resulting from the depreciation of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar. Looking forward exchange rate volatility will continue to manifest in our gross margins. In particular a recent depreciation of the Euro against the US dollar together with the strong Australian dollar will impact our gross margins. ", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $84.1 million an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms SG&A expenses increases by a modest 10% over the prior year quarter. The increases in SG&A reflects expenses to support sales growth as well as activities targeted at increasing the awareness and diagnosis of sleep disorder breathing. SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved to 30.6% compared to the year ago figure of 31.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in that 31% range for the balance of the fiscal year 2010. ", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $19.1 million, an increase of 28% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 1% over the prior year quarter. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7% consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward and again subject to currency movements we'd expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in that 7% range for the balance of the fiscal year. We continue to devote significant resources to product innovation and clinical study activities. ", "Amortization of acquired intangibles were $2.1million for the quarter and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.3 million.  During the quarter we also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% and we estimate our fiscal year 2010 tax rate will be in the vicinity of 27%.", "Turning now to revenues in more detail, overall American sales were $148 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter.  This was driven by strong growth in both flow generators and masks, with strong contributions from our high end APAP devices, full face masks, and incremental revenue from our recently launched gel mask.", "Sales outside the Americas totaled $127.1 million, an increase of 27% over the prior year quarter.  As expected, sales outside the Americas were positively impacted by currency movements.  In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 14% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenues between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales were $75.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter.  Masks in other styles were $72.1 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year.  Fr revenues outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $86.2 million, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 17%.  Masks and other sales were $40.9 million, an increase of 18%, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8% over the prior year.  On a group basis and constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 21% while masks and other increased by 13%.  ", "Cash flow from operations was $11.6 million for the quarter.  The operating cash flow was impacted by the timing of income tax payment totalled $61.7 million during the quarter.  Our underlying cash flow remains very strong.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.5 million.  Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totalled $15.6 million.  We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program.  During the quarter we repurchased 606,000 shares for consideration of $30.1 million as part of our ongoing buyback program.  As of today we have repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares out of a total authorized buyback of 10 million shares.", "Our balance sheet remains strong and conservatively geared.  For December 1, total assets stored at $1.6 billion and net equity was $1.3 billion.  Group external debt was $145 million while cash and cash equivalents totalled $451 million.  I'll now hand the call back to Kieran.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "All right.  Thanks, Brett.  Jennifer, let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Zable with Natixis Bleichroeder.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Hey, guys.  Congrats here on a really impressive quarter and thanks for taking my questions.  I have a bunch, but I'll try to keep it brief here.  First, just market commentary.  I know we always ask that just kind of what you see out there and anything picking up, slowing down, or pretty status quo?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "The market remains robust.  We still think the market growth is around what we've experienced this past year.  The indications out there at this point, our physician awareness, clinical awareness, continues to grow.  And from the Americas perspective, HST continues to be piloted.  We continue to good progress in that space.  I'd hesitate to say that it's material yet in the results.  I think that's probably more ahead of us than behind us seeing the impact of HST.", "", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great.  And then a lot of people obviously talking about the competitive landscape.  With the announcement of the S9 obviously concerns will be less, but can you just give us a little bit of color?  I mean, this quarter constant currency growth actually accelerated.  I know it takes a while to ramp up the S9, so should we see some trialing maybe next quarter as that would be the peak of the trialing and then coming back in your fourth quarter we see you guys fighting back or are you guys just not feeling it at all?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Well, I think it's important to recognize that some of the competitive launches that have occurred here in the last couple of months are, in our view, attempts to catch up to what has been in the marketplace now for the last 18 months.  The S8 II series of products that were underpinned with this Easy-Breathe motor technology and the wave forms that are associated with the Easy-Breathe wave forms have been extremely well received within the marketplace and they create a fundamental sort of base for us to compete against new products.  So the new products that have rolled out, they're going to get trial.  We assume that the completive products got a good trial, but I got to tell you, our field sales forces felt very comfortable walking into those same accounts with the high quality ResMed products, the quiet ResMed products with the algorithms that are associated with it and we still feel very comfortable competing with the S8 II.  In our opinion, you look at the S9, that's a bonus on top of that. ", "And when you look at the product and people get the ability to physically look at this product and then be able to experience its ease of use to be able to look at some of the feature sets that are very patient meaningful and they're going to be customer meaningful as well because they are oriented towards improving compliance and simplifying the ability for patients to adapt to therapy.  In addition to providing additional revenue streams for some of the customers there is a lot of good things that are going to come out with this S9.", "Now, our intention is to launch it like we have sort of the classic ResMed way if you will, so rolling it out first in Europe, then we are going to be rolling it out towards the end of this quarter in the US.  You're absolutely right in your comments that it takes several months for you to get around and start seeing that ramp and really feel that materiality as we get into fiscal year 2011.  So we're excited about that launch process.", "And just as in sort of our classic way we're going to start with the AutoSet and the Elite and then over time we'll fill out the CPAP area as well as move over to the bio levels.  So we're feeling good at what we're at and we'll be rolling it out through the rest of this fiscal year.", "Joshua Zable - Natixis Bleichroeder", "Great, and then I'll let other people have a chance, but just to be clear, you have not yet launched outside the US, but you will be shortly?  And then I guess are we going to get to see a sample, if you will, at the investor day next week?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "All right, great.  So actually we've begun the early shipments in Europe, but again like I'm saying, these things kind of ramp up, but we're absolutely delivering product and have been for about a week or so.  I'm looking at (inaudible), but yeah that last week or so, and yes you'll absolutely be able to see a device during the investor day next week.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Andrew with William Blair & Company, LLC.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC", "Good afternoon.  I wanted to follow up on a couple of things briefly.  Brett, could you give us some sense of the impact of currency on gross margin if you could isolate it?  And then how did that flow throughout the bottom line once you back out hedging gain and what not?", "Brett Sandercock", "If you looked at that sequential decline, the vast majority of that would have been impact that's currency related is basically the real driver on that.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC", "So the sequential decline in the gross margin percentage of over a full point was just currency?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, predominantly.  I mean, as you know there's plenty of factors that impact the geographic mix, product mix, manufacturing and so on in the mix, but if you look at it and say what's the predominant driver it was currency and it was the appreciation of the Aussie.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC", "Okay, great.  And then the lag effect in terms of that flowing through, are we right to think of that as maybe two or even as long as three quarters when \u2014 because now we have had a recovery a bit in the dollar so it wouldn't look like gross margin based on currency is going to recover for a couple of quarters?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah.  It's certainly not as long as three quarters.  It'll be around that one-and-a-half-quarter mark, that lag impact.  So still some of that to flow through, but you're right, the Aussie \u2014 well, you know how volatile currencies are at the moment but the Aussie has come off from $0.925 to about I think under $0.87 within the last three weeks.  So clearly that's coming down.  It'll take a little while to flow through, but we'll get that benefit down the track for sure.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC", "Okay.  Two other quick questions.  Kieran, you mentioned you've had kind of a minimal impact or benefit from the gel mask so far.  I mean, is that $10 million or something that we should look for or even that that we should look for a substantially different dynamic in the next couple of quarters?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Yeah.  You know, Ben, we don't get into that sort of line item detail when we break out revenues just because it's sort of a slippery slope over time of detail, but what I intend to say is that the product has been very well received.  The way a product like this launches is that not all sizes are available Day 1.  So you get out the predominant sizes and then over the course of several months you fill out the rest of the SKUs, you fill out your sampling packages, et cetera.  So the initial shot over the bow came during Q2, and what you'll see throughout Q3 is exactly what I just described, filling out of the rest of the SKUs.  We expect by the end of the quarter we'll be shipping all the SKUs in that product and we'll be fully up on the samples and then we'll be full steam ahead.", "And I got to tell you, the early feedback has been fantastic.  It's really encouraging.  And not only on the gel, the gel and the Swift FX.  When you look at some of the customer testimonials and the patient testimonials that have been coming in, these are darn good products.  So we\u2019re looking forward to them.  And by the way, as you know mass products tend to be on the side of gross margin contributors.  So we\u2019re certainly looking forward to that continued expansion as well.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC", "And last structural question, I mean, one thing we\u2019ve noticed in the last several, really probably couple of years, has been the mix shift in Europe changing substantially in favor of generators.  And particularly this quarter you grew generators quite a bit faster than masks, it looks like worldwide.  I mean, that supposedly in the face of a new competitive launch.  Now you\u2019ve got all these new products.  Is that going to balance out where we\u2019ll see more balance growth from your perspective the next four quarters with all of these new launches?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Well, I think if you go historically, you\u2019ve tended to see in Europe that actually on a consistent basis you tend to see the flow generators do represent a larger percentage of the revenues in Europe.  And you do tend to see higher growth rates in those categories, right.  So, and remember also in Europe you have the ventilation line which is a flow generator heavy part of what we do.  And you don\u2019t have that in the US.  So, as we look forward, I think we\u2019re very much in a reasonably balanced phase of the product launches.  Certainly as we look at some of the new mask launches that gives us continue, hope to, to grow those categories and to continue to penetrate them.  But I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a pretty classic mix.  Brett, do you have anything to add to that?", "Brett Sandercock ", "Yeah, I mean, I think, some of that European, I think it\u2019s turning to really good consistent results coming out of Germany out of the last (inaudible).  And some of the mix that we had in Germany we\u2019ve passed that now completely, getting good growth out of that.  And as you know in Germany it\u2019s time care, so it\u2019s really quite generator driven.  Nice that in fact that the cost of that business sort to speak.  So I think some of that driving through is waiting for those nice out performance and flow generators in Europe.  Been throwing in the mix also, we\u2019ve got the S-9 launch which is a new platform.  So I think over time you\u2019ll get back to historical levels where (inaudible) will grow stronger than flow gen.  But with some many new product launches that some of that mix might change a little over the short term.", "Benjamin Andrew - William Blair & Company, LLC", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Clair from Piper Jaffray.  Please proceed.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "I guess the first question here, just a quick one on the soft gel.  When do you think we should expect that OUS?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Soft gel OUS?  Outside of the US.  ", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Sorry, IOW.", "Brett Sandercock ", "We\u2019re expecting to launch in France early March.  And then we\u2019ll progressively roll out over the next four to eight weeks on country by country.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay.  Great.  And then, Brett, just kind of with where foreign exchange rates are, where they\u2019ve been over the last couple months here.  What do you think we should expect from a gross margin perspective, say in the next quarter here?  Will we be above the 59% or how should we think about it?", "Brett Sandercock ", "Just on the exchange rates through the volatility at the moment, the quarter to quarter estimate is just not making sense at the moment.  Give you a lot of color on that.  I mean, you know what exchange rates are doing as well as I do.  And you know that they\u2019ll be short term, there\u2019s probably some head wins with the Euro.  The lag on the Aussie, but that\u2019ll held at \u2013 by the next few quarters after that.  But I think what I would say, the FOREX we can\u2019t really control.  But I\u2019m really confident and comfortable with our ability to expand the GM through strong \u2013 when you put out the flow for example, limiting our cost structure which we\u2019ve been doing, managing cogs and continuous improvement programs.  We\u2019re working hard to do all that.  And we\u2019re looking at (inaudible) as well.  And part of innovation and the product flow we\u2019ve designed to do that.", "So I think we\u2019re doing everything we can and working pretty hard to withstand the margins.  But in short terms we will be subject to some of the volatility around those currencies.  And we\u2019ll just have to deal with that and keep doing what we need to do.  ", "The only other thing I\u2019d say, we have been working pretty hard over the last few years to diversify our prospect away from the Aussie dollar.  And we have been relatively successful.  We\u2019ve done through materials purchasing, Singapore manufacturing, for example.  And just trying to contain those operational costs.  So we\u2019ll continue to do that as well.  And it doesn\u2019t mean to say we won\u2019t be impacted because we will.  Just not as bad as it was, for example, two years ago.  But I don\u2019t want to dismiss the currency impact that\u2019s there.  But it\u2019s short term as well as (inaudible) and the underlying sustainable margin improvement we\u2019re absolutely working on.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay.  Then that was sort of good lead in for my next question.  Just an update on Singapore?  Where are we in terms manufacturing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Singapore has been a very successful venture for us.  The plant came up to speed quite rapidly.  We\u2019ve now celebrated what our 13-14 months of operations.  We\u2019re already producing about 20% of our volume our of Singapore.  So we\u2019ve been just very pleased with the quality of the work force with their ability to integrate our products into a quality system to be able to mirror the success that we\u2019ve seen in Sydney. And at the same time be able to provide some of the costs and tax advantages that are associated with Singapore.  So we\u2019re very pleased with where we\u2019re at.  ", "We continue to build capabilities there.  The initial phases were really about, what\u2019s called assembly type work.  Over the course of these year we\u2019re going to continue to build out some of the capabilities and for instance manufacturing of motors.  So that we can not only produce in the LA area but we can also have a secondary source within a company.  And Singapore, we look at building some capabilities on the LSR, so the moving capabilities, etcetera, itself.  We\u2019ve got a very strong foundation.  It ramped up quickly.  And we\u2019re feeling very comfortable with the ability to continue to ramp that.", "We\u2019re not giving any specific estimates what we want to produce there.  But I can tell you we feel very comfortable with our ability to ramp.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay.  Great.  Congratulations on a great quarter.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall from UBS.  Please proceed.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Could I perhaps just ask you to just detail the features (inaudible) of S9 a little bit more.  And I guess in particular just some of the smarts that you\u2019ve added in this time around that are really going to differentiate you from your competitors?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Yeah.  Let me throw the ball over to McFarrell who runs (inaudible).", "Peter C. Farrell Ph.D.", "Andrew, there are many benefits that would take the length of this conference call to cover.  But obviously you\u2019re not really there to that level of detail on investor relations a bit like this.  If I could summarize the three major benefits, I\u2019d focus on the three Cs that it brings, comfort, compliance and connectivity.  There\u2019s more including cost effectiveness and others.  But the comfort that you can get from this product from the new climate line system that provides a heated wire circuits.  We\u2019ve closed loop control of temperature and humidity.  Incredible.  The enhanced (inaudible), which brings even low (inaudible) and more comfort and low worker breathing for the patient.  Which all leads to greater compliance.  Which is what the patient wants.  It\u2019s what the provider wants.  And it\u2019s what the insurance company wants as well.", "But we\u2019ve also added increased expansion of conductivity.  So we\u2019ve taken our S9 wireless capability that we have really worked on these last five years on the S7 and S8 range to the next level.  And we\u2019ve added other ways to get connectivity.  So I don\u2019t want to go into too many more details on it.  Other than to say that the initial reception from our internal sales teams, the French national sales team earlier this quarter got it and they launched at the national pneumology conference this last weekend in France.  Amazing reception from the physicians and from customers.  ", "So early days but seeing great response in Europe and looking forward to the full data of the quarter, taking it to the rest of the world.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "It is a fantastic product series.  This is going to be \u2013 just as SA2 and the easy breeze motor technology established a new level within the market place, this certainly has the potential to do the same.  And again, we haven\u2019t released it yet in the US.  So we\u2019re waiting later in the quarter and the availability and the access to everyone is going to be quite easy.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "We were hearing one of the features was, I guess, feedback to the patient that they could measure how good a night of sleep they were getting.  Could you perhaps expand on that if that\u2019s one of the features?", "Kieran T. Gallahue ", "Sure, Andrew, I\u2019ll talk about that too.  You seem to know quite a lot about this.  I love to talk about it.  And it ties into my second C there, which is compliance.  Having that sort of bio feedback mechanism where a patient can \u2013 the day after their therapy, at the discretion of their provider and physician mind you, have access to the hours of use that they had that night.  And the (inaudible) given to the patient by a smiley face or a frowny face depending on the (inaudible) is up and above the 0.4 maybe the second sort of gradient that\u2019s accepted standard for acceptable mouth rates.  I spoke potentially, again, at the discretion of the provider or the physician, an efficacy measure such as AHI.  ", "And the patient can have access to those.  What we\u2019ve seen in our clinical trials of this device and in the early market acceptance in our controlled product launches is that patients who have access to data get more engaged in therapy.  And that\u2019s sticking it through the therapy in those first seven days leads to months and years and years of trailing revenues for the provider in masks and accessories and for the homecare provider or the HME involved, but also on going compliance reduction of chronic health care and disease problems, such as Type II diabetes and cardiovascular recurrences and others that can be improved by ongoing care.  So it's a great combination again for the patient, the physician, the provider, and ResMed as well as we contribute to that.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "", "Yeah.  That's a really nice feature.  Maybe just in the interest of time can I just ask a final question just in terms of your growth outlook?  Maybe just help me understand what you're seeing in terms of home sleep testing?  I know you've talked to the insurers sort of requiring that as the first line, and then perhaps you also mentioned in the release, just transport safety.  If I could just ask sort of on both those camps where things are progressing?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Sure.  So the home sleep testing is progressing right along the schedule that we predicted a couple of years ago.  First year it was out there, first calendar year, it was really about is it here to stay or not and clearly it is.  Last year was about the initiation of pilots in different types of providers; some HMEs, some primary-care physicians, some independent diagnostic testing facilities, and certainly sleep physicians. And there were a number of pilots that we're aware of that have used, by the way, various types of diagnostic devices and have tried different processes to accomplish it.  And as you might expect, some of the business models flushed out and others are doing quite well.  So that's progressing well.", "And what's very interesting and encouraging actually is in the last \u2014 oh G-d, it's probably about 14 weeks or so, we've heard a very different voice even among the sleep physicians where the understanding the acceptance that home sleep testing is here to stay and it makes most sense to understand how to integrate that within your practice . The number of questions, the interest in getting involve in pilots and acquiring home sleep testing devices has increased substantially.  So I think that's a good signal for the market to say look, the pilots are working and it's time to move forward with greater acceptance.", "Now, there was the three Ps we've always talked about; it was process, it was payment, and it was politics.  The process and the payment we've really figured out.  People are getting paid for it and the process is what I just mentioned.  The politics is really driven by the payers moving from a you can do HST to a you must do HST, and that's what we referred to.   There's some insurance companies in certain parts of the country that are piloting with that, but it's a little bit harder to predict exactly when they're going to flip to that you must phase, although we do know that some large insurers are considering it.  They have put together teams to look at it and it certainly wouldn't be surprising if before the end of this calendar year, again hard to predict, but it wouldn't be surprising if one of the large ones moves and starts requiring that.  And then that just opens up the gate towards further enhancement.", "So this is a good process for the industry to follow.  You don't want it happening all at once because things fall apart then.  This process of the gentle boil, of working out the pilots, of getting it integrated, and showing that it actually promotes good care and it's not going to promote some overuse or overutilization has been very positive.", "That does roll into occupational health and safety.  The interest within the transportation sector in the trucking community, the airline pilots, boat riders and what not, there is a number of companies that have sprung up to try to serve those and there are some large customers that are already in the HME business as an example, or in the sleep diagnosis business, which are trying to integrate that into their practice.  So I'd say that that foundation continues to be built.  It always takes a little longer than you think it's going to take, but all the signals are positive.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "That's terrific.  Thank you very much, great quarter.  I'll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse", "Good morning, guys.  Just had two questions, the first is just on the balance sheet.  Your cash balance is starting to look quite large, just wondering if there were any comments you could give particularly on the buyback and whether you might look to accelerate that or any other type of capital management?  The second question is maybe for Kieran, you moved with the Narval purchase outside of CPAP, just wondering if you could expand your thoughts on or give us some commentary on how you're looking at the mild to moderate sleep apnea market going forward?  Thanks.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "So on the capital management side yeah, we do have a very strong balance sheet.  We mentioned the cash balance and of course we've got about $140-$150 million in debt that offsets that.  We're very comfortable with the position we've taken to date.  You know that we again acquired about $30 million of our own stock back during this last quarter and that's in addition to what we've done over the prior two years so we feel comfortable continuing to participate in those stock buybacks at an appropriate basis, and as Brett mentioned, we still have about 8.5 million shares left in that authorization for the buyback program.", "And we're always looking at other appropriate uses for cash, but we're very careful to let it burn a whole in our pocket and to look to do, for instance, M&A that is not appropriate or that we think is not going to add value to the business or that we think doesn't leverage the strength of the ResMed team.  So we feel comfortable with what we've done to date.  ", "As it relates to Narval, that acquisition is now complete.  The team is in the midst of integration.  It was a low risk way of putting a toe in the water of complimentary technologies for the treatment of mild sleep disorder breathing and particularly of obstructive sleep apnea.  It is, just to remind those on the phone, a company that's based in Leon, France which is great because it's right next to where our commercial headquarters is in France and in fact we're going to be combining those facilities shortly.  We've already begun integrating the teams.  It is one of two players \u2014 only two players in the market within France that have reimbursement for these MRD devices, and they already had a running start.  They have a reputation within the industry, and maybe most importantly for us, we saw a pathway to profitability by participating in this category.  They use CAD/CAM technology for much of their manufacturing and we saw that as a technology that allows scalability and allows the device manufacturer to actually make a return on these, and we can leverage our experience, our history, our relationships within the sleep community and be able to appropriately promote these technologies, again for the appropriate uses.  ", "So it's an experiment at this point that's going well and as appropriate we're going to investigate other countries to expand into and we'll look at everything you'd expect us to look at.  We're going to look at the distribution that's required in those marketplaces, we're going outlook at the price points in those marketplaces, and we're going to look at our strengths in those marketplaces, and then market by market we'll make a business decision about expansion.  So early days, but we're very pleased with that acquisition.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse", "Okay.  Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Merrill Lynch/Bank of America.", "Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch/Bank of America", "Yeah.  Good afternoon, guys.  Just a quick question on the S9 if I can.  You talked a lot about management by exception in the last quarter focusing on compliance, and compliance certainly seems to become an increasing issue for the industry.  Can you talk about ResTraxx at all and whether that feature is within the S9 or whether we're persisting with it or increasing its emphasis with the S9.", "Peter C. Farrell Ph.D.", "Yeah, Matthew.  We will have the ability to do management by exception with the S9 system and there will be an S9 wireless module that will connection the back of the S9 devices that takes the data from the device to the cloud and allows the home care providers, HME, and physicians, to have access on a protected basis to that information and so they can go and manage their patients and choose how, where, and when to get back to their patients to encourage them to increase their therapy or participate more in their therapy or address mask leak or look at say a central apnea index going up and maybe the patient doesn't need just the basic CPAP and APAP, maybe they need an upgrade to a VPAP adapt or some other sort of adaptive server inhalation technology and need to get back into the sleep channel on that front.", "So we will have the capability on the S9 platform and it's actually a great advantage for us.  No other industry on the S8 II platform had that and we look forward to continuing that on the S9.  ", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "And just add a little color as well, you did mention the management by exception and one of the things that Mick had highlighted earlier were a number of the feature set that are designed for improved comfort and improved compliance.  So our true objective here first of all is to produce the exceptions to make it easier for people to get compliance, and then certainly using our leadership positioning in our wireless monitoring to be able to make those few exceptions that do exist then or for those exceptions that do exist to certainly be able to treat them in the most cost effective way.", "Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch/Bank of America", "Thanks.  And just one quick followup question; obviously you have access to that data, does that assist you with product development given that the data would be quite powerful seeing what age, what profile, what combination of equipment, is leading to compliance?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "We're very careful about the use of patient data.  That's proprietary to the physicians and to the care providers and so we are very careful about that.  We have other ways of gathering that data. We have very strong relationships in the sleep community and our innovation team is very successful.  We don't need to look at those avenues for data.  It's a good question, but that's not what we want to use the data for.", "Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch/Bank of America", "Great.  Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much.  Kieran, just a question on market.  I mean, I know the question was asked before, but I guess if you could talk about the fact that you've clearly taken some market share, what do you think the underlying market growth is?  And I guess my question really is centered on the fact that from what we understand or the feedback that we're getting is that volume of patients going through sleep centers, it doesn't seem to be as strong as it has been in the past, and with home testing, by your own sort of commentary still sort of a story for next year, I mean do you see any concern that the underlying market is declining?  I'm trying to understand where your market share has been going in that environment.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Yeah.  These are the same questions that have really been coming up for the last year, year and a half, and I'm pleased that we can say that it's been consistent that we remain very positive that you have double-digit growth.  The Americas, we had said about a year ago we thought it would come off maybe a couple of points, but it was still up around the 12% or so range.  I think we continue to feel comfortable that that's about right, perhaps a few points ahead of that on volume, but that would be on a revenue basis.  And in Europe in the high single digits, and so for a blended growth rate in the double-digit ranges.", "So I think we still feel the underlying strength in that market. I think you have to be careful when you're looking at these proxies.  Part of what you're missing sometimes when you look at just one indicator of potential growth, let's say number of beds is first of all there is still bed growth and sometimes you have better bed utilization.  So for instance you have people that were doing two-night studies that will go to a split-night study.  So instead of doing a study one night and the next night a titration, they'll get the patient all in one night or they're working at how to reduce their no-show lists, et cetera.  ", "So there's a lot of different avenues that can contribute to growth on that side, and then in addition you continue to have HMEs were are working at maintaining compliance.  The stick, if you will, that CMS put out there a year and a half ago could very well be the best thing that happened for patient care because what it said is you the HME need to spend more time making sure these patients are compliant or else you don't get paid in the short run.  And we know that once you get those patients compliant in not only the short run, but they represent very significant opportunity in the longer run with continued accessory sales, continued market sales, and eventually continued CPAP sales.  So that's been a positive contributor as well that as people maintain their focus on compliance it's a good situation for the industry and it helps the focus on trailing annuities.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Are you able to measure internally as to what level of repeat sales or how much of your revenue base is coming from the sales to existing patients versus new patients?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "It's very difficult to get that level of granularity.  You have HMEs which are very protective of their data and it's the same SKU, if you will, that goes to a new patient versus an existing patient.  So we have some proxies where we have certain customers that do their compliant user replenishment through certain locations so we get a sense for their focus, but I think more importantly it's in our customer relationships where we get feedback from the sales force and know that patients are instituting these replenishment programs.  ", "So I can't break it down to the figures and I certainly couldn't do it on a short-term basis, but I think we do feel comfortable that that focus on generating compliance and then mining the compliant users continues to expand.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and just one final question on that.  So the growth rates or the market growth that you've talked about this year end and last, if we talk about home testing starting to become material over the next few years, is that on top of that growth rate do you think?  I mean, is this a boost coming in the next couple of years?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Yeah look, I think there's no reason that home sleep test can't improve the volume of patients going through this market.  Again you never get into sort of the quarter-to-quarter stuff, but if you look at it over the medium term, if you look at it over the longer term, and you look at what home sleep testing brings, it stops or it eliminates some forms of leakage.  So let's just talk about two of them as an example.  30% of the patients who get a referral to a sleep lab never show up, and why don't they show up?  They don't show up maybe because it's a several hundred dollar co pay, they don't show up because they've got to be away from their family for a night.  They don't show up because they don't want to be wired up like Gulliver's Travels with a camera on them all night.  It's not very comfortable when you think about it.  ", "Now, lots of people still do it which tells you how important this disorder is and how important treating this disorder is, but still, 30% don't show up.  If HST does nothing other than take that 30% number to 15%, you're talking about a 20% increase in the flow of patients that get diagnosed at that point, right?  Then there's a secondary form of leakage which is \u2014 now again, put yourself in the place of a primary-care physician and you are looking at a patient and trying to determine whether to send them to a sleep lab or have a sleep test.  If they have an expensive test that's very inconvenience, your index of suspicion has to be pretty darn high before you send them to that test.  Now you have a test that's simple to use, that can be used in their own home, but is still highly accurate \u2014 that borderline case that maybe you weren't going to send for a sleep test before, now you're going to be willing to send.", "So if you just strip away everything else and just focus on the facts and the common sense piece of it, the ability for this to contribute to growth I think I quite significant and I think as a company we're very comfortable with that.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Right.  That's very helpful.  Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Bye with Jefferies & Co.", "Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.", "Thanks, guys.  Just a couple of ones on a lot of concern on pricing in the market over the years and we noticed Invacare just raised their oxygen concentrator prices to the homecare dealers about 4%-5%.  I know it's a different market, but I guess does that say anything to you about the reception out there what's coming in competitive bidding or sort of any takeaway for the sleep market?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Well, I don't know about a direct corollary with that action, but I will say in general the market remains healthy.  We got into this with the questions before on gross margin and I think as Brett very well articulated, we feel just real comfortable with our product flow.  We feel very comfortable with our ability to reduce our cost per future set that we're delivering, and we feel comfortable with the ability to continue to provide premium products with new feature sets that can allow us to have customers trade up within the marketplace, just as we've seen with the auto setting devices because of the data capabilities and because of the Easy-Breathe motor technology.  And as we've seen in the bilevel category which historically we've been very underpenetrated and we've been able to, with what we believe is a superior product, 75%+ quieter than the competition, very responsive \u2014 we're able to move in there and trade them up.", "So we see the market.  Certainly price pressures won't go away tomorrow.  The ability to significantly raise prices I think would be difficult to forecast that, but I think through product mix on one side, through delivering feature sets that are meaningful that can drive compliance, can reduce cost of delivering the product for the customer \u2014 we have, I think, a very strong value proposition.", "Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.", "Okay.  And just on the Bill in Washington, HR7390 to essentially get rid of competitive bidding, I think they're having a lobbying event in your neck of the woods in California pretty soon.  Do you have any thoughts on one, do you get involved in lobbying for this?  Do you care?  I mean, you care, but do you feel that it's worth your time to lobby for potentially adding more sponsors to this bill?  I think they're up around 140 in terms of sponsors, so just any thoughts on that?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "We feel it's important to support industry efforts that are geared towards recognizing the value that HMEs provide, the service that they provide to the industry, and to recognize the advantages that home care brings to the health care system.  I mean, when we think about what health care systems around the globe are struggling with, they're trying to keep people out of a lot of these expensive hospital settings, but at the same time they're trying to manage chronic disorders and they're trying to get more predictive in care . Categories like the treatment of sleep disorder breathing or the use of adaptive server ventilation in treating heart failure that is big \u2014 we have a large study that is ongoing right now in Europe and we're very, very optimistic about the results that we expect to see in a couple of years in that category.", "Those things we think are important for people to know about.  Now, we don't do a lot of direct lobbying, but we certainly support several industry groups that are engaged and are involved in getting the word out.", "Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.", "Great.  Just two more followups, do you have any thoughts on the upcoming audit on prepayment rates as it concerns the CPAP that's coming out of Jurisdiction B?  I think they're focused a little bit on the documentation requirements on the post-four month range, and I know you've got the compliance software on that front, but it's also going back and documenting they saw a doctor.  Have you heard any \u2014 is that a concern at all, I guess, in terms of the \u2014", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Well, certainly not material, but let me throw it over to Dave Pendarvis.", "David Pendarvis", "Yeah, Peter.  We're aware of it.  We rely on these areas mostly on our HME partners.  Obviously they're the ones who have to supply the appropriate documentation.  This is a Medicare issue.  It's not the overall issue, but it's our expectation that our customers have been following the proper paperwork, they've been getting the right forms now.  In any situation when you're kind of putting in a new requirement there are always some slips and downs, but it's our expectation that by and large this won't have an impact on the operations.  There might be some minor distraction to a particular customer who gets under an audit, but it's our expectation that the HMEs are compliant with all the requirements and there shouldn't be any long-term issues.", "Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.", "", "Thanks.  Maybe just one last one, any comments on Qnexa's data on sleep apnea?  It's coming up for obesity approval, obviously it could have some off-label usage.  And just on what their dataset compares to the gold standard here on CPAP and is it maybe an opportunity to copromote if these guys are maybe just going after mild candidates to just identify more sleep apnea patients?", "David Pendarvis", "Yeah.  We obviously track developments on it in the pharmaceutical industry just as we track developments on the surgical area and device areas looking at potentially if there's any substitutes for something that can impact our markets in a positive or a negative way.", "As you know, there tends to be a lot more sizzle and noise then there tends to be depth when these early data come out, and so as we look at this now the idea that there's going to be a single drug that's going to cure obesity, I guess you can make your own bed on that.  I'm not sure that that's a bed that I'd be comfortable making in the short term, but that's the basic focus that these guys are driving towards.", "We don't see, at this point, a risk and at this point we don't see a material opportunity for partnership.  That being said, things do evolve and if we feel that it is appropriate, just as we've demonstrated with our alliances with LifeScan and alliances with Guidance when we were first entering the heart failure space, alliances with appropriate \u2014 Philips even when we're talking about public relations or we're talking about education.  We're very comfortable with reaching out and finding mutual WIFMs, what's in it for me, in these cases.  And if we see it we'll do it.  But at this point I think we're comfortable in sort of a watching brief.", "Peter Bye - Jefferies & Co.", "", "All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Natalie Kelly with COMMSEC.", "Natalie Kelly - COMMSEC", "Thanks a lot.  I was just wondering if you could give some color on any (inaudible) improvements that you're getting from your two recently released masks and also that you expect to get from the new S9 series?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Yeah, great question.  So as you know, when we enter an area that we're already in, I think a good example would be the Swift FX or the S9 which are basically replacements for existing products, and it's true with other products as well, but I think it's always easier to sort of calculate that delta on the things that exist.  Our belief and our direction to the R&D team, and it's a very, very capable team, is to design products that can improve the feature sets, so it can improve the efficacy or improve the aesthetics or have some meaningful benefit to patients and to customers, but to do it at a lower cost basis.  And that's particular enabled when you go through generational leaps.  ", "When you go through the normal learning curve you certainly have some substantial benefits that you can provide, but when you do generational leaps, and I think a good example will be the S9, it gives you the ability to take advantage of developments that have occurred within the electronics industry as an example, or within the computing industry, or in the communications industry.  And we can apply some of those improvements to new platforms.  So absolutely, we will look at examples within the mask category, we will loo at examples within the flow generators, and I mention just two right off the top of my head.  Both of those would represent opportunities for not only enhancement of performance, but also offer cost of goods reduction.", "Natalie Kelly - COMMSEC", "Great.  And just one more question, just wondering what feedback you're getting from the DMA's intensive compliance levels?  Are we starting to see compliance levels in the US sort of increase to European levels as the markets shift across to the APAPs and the BiPAPs, those higher end products just really sort of concerning those trends?", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Well it's always hard to give you accurate or specific figures on compliance and the reason is any HME you talk to is between 85%-95% compliant. They're always the best at it and it's the guy down the street that has the problem.  But I will say that we feel comfortable that because of the change in the technology that is being used and because of the informatic capabilities of those devices \u2014 Mick mentioned before that customers and patients who have access to data and they engage in the use of that data, that it demonstrates a focus that improves compliance.  And the nature of what we are delivering today and the increase in the number of auto set devices as an example, the use of ResTraxx as an example, and maybe even forgetting all those and just say the focus of the HME; understanding and knowing the importance of compliance and reinforcing of that, all of that leads to greater touch points with patients which will inevitably lead to higher compliance.  So I think we can feel comfortable saying directionally it is moving in the right direction.  I think it will be a little bit harder to get more specific on the numbers in the short term.", "Natalie Kelly - COMMSEC", "Thanks for that.", "Operator", "We are now at the one-hour mark so I will turn the call back over to Kieran Gallahue for his final remarks.", "Kieran T. Gallahue", "Well great, thank you, everybody, for your time and attention.  As always, we would like to thank our employees all over the globe in the various functions for their stellar efforts that drive ResMed's performance.  I think you can see that in not only the results of this quarter, but you can see it in the product flow that we have begun launching throughout this year and the pipeline that we have to follow.  So it's a very exciting time for ResMed.  We're very pleased with the efforts and the results of the team throughout the globe and we look forward to updating you as we move into the next quarter.

My name is Keisha, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new market for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. ", "With that said, I will like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Ferrell, please go ahead, sir.", "Peter Farrell", "Thank you very much, Keisha. Good afternoon. Good morning. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin with a summary on the quarter and talk about -- briefly about acquisitions and the recent partnership announcement. And I'll then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, who as you know is our CFO. And Brett will go through the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take questions. And most members of the senior management team are also with us today and I might -- in fact, I'll very likely call on them in to get involved in some of the question -- some of the answers to your questions. ", "First, the financial summary. We finished what we would describe as a very solid quarter and another excellent year. Global revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011, the final quarter, grew 17% to $342 million or up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in the Americas grew a very solid 14% year-over-year to $183 million, while the rest of the world revenue increased by 22% or in constant currency terms, 8% to $159 million. GAAP EPS increased 9% to $0.37 for the quarter. And if we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was $0.39. ", "In discussing product category performance, let me start with Masks and accessories as the results in this category were extremely encouraging. We've now exceeded over $0.5 billion in annual Masks sales alone. We believe we're hitting home runs on all the value propositions for the decision makers in our channel. We have a suite of products, in particular, the recent Quattro FX or let me say the FX series, the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX, which meet the market needs all the way from the lab to the patient. Our Masks are effective, easy to fit, comfortable and more value for money. And they require less callbacks and ensure more compliance. In fact, on Tuesday, I was visiting a sleep position in Oklahoma City where the temperature -- beautiful day, the temperature hit about 114 degrees. But Jonathan Schwartz's lab, he has 24 beds, and he was waxing lyrical almost about the Mirage FX, which he said fits virtually all patients immediately. ", "Turning to flow generators. Our global growth in sleep therapy devices was once again driven strongly by sales of our S9 order set. Preference for this product continues to increase globally, and the order set has become a consistent source of our growth. We believe the increase in home sleep testing is and will continue to fuel sales of the order set. As expected, the addition of the bilevels on the S9 platform has arrested the decline in overall device sales in the Americas, and sales of the new S9 bilevels are doing very well and are ramping to our expectations. ", "Adding to flow generator performance was the recent launch in Europe of the Stellar 100, which is an adult and pediatric ventilator designed for both noninvasive and invasive use. Sales of Stellar have been growing progressively each month as we've launched country by country in Europe and parts of Asia. As we've always maintained, it takes time to launch any new product, but it is certainly ramping to our expectations. And the Stellar 150, where we will launch globally in fiscal Q2, that is the final quarter of this year, calendar 2011, this product includes what's known as IPAPs, our new automatic bilevel mode, which is automatic in both expiration and inspiration. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our progress in product development. ", "In addition to our success in internal development, we are pleased with the progress we are making in building strategic partnerships or relationships. And let me comment briefly on CareFusion, Gr\u00fcndler, which was just announced of course, and BiancaMed. Just over a week ago, we announced a 5-year exclusive distribution agreement with CareFusion to market our ventilation products in hospitals, long-term acute facilities or acute-care, I should say, facilities and skilled nursing facilities. The initial focus will be on the launch of the Stellar 100 and related products, and the Stellar is an excellent fit in the CareFusion ventilation platform as it provides them with the product facilities' differentiated features and a more competitive price point. It also allows us to quickly enter the institutional healthcare pressure support ventilation marketplace. According to -- in Medicare's February 2011 report, the Americas sub-acute noninvasive pressure support ventilation market is the fastest-growing segment, estimated to be, albeit sub-$100 million, but it's growing at more than 6% annually. ", "As we announced today along with our results, we acquired Gr\u00fcndler Medical GmbH from Freudenstadt in Germany. Gr\u00fcndler is obviously a German-based company, developing innovative medical humidification products. These humidifiers fit a wide range of ventilators from neonatal and pediatric to noninvasive pressure support to the intensive care unit. The strategic implications of this deal are that it enables us to provide a system sale with existing and future ventilators into the home -- into both the home and the hospital markets. In short, it's a one-stop shop for humidification. It will provide incremental revenue as we enter into a new market segment, allowing us to build our expertise, as well as allow us to build a competitive position in humidification, which we have never really had. And we'll be able to leverage the humidification technology between both ventilation and the sleep-disordered breathing space. We have known the founders of Gr\u00fcndler for several years and are looking forward to having them join the ResMed team, and I might parenthetically add that 2 of the senior people in Gr\u00fcndler are both physicians. So that will add to our medical support team. ", "Also, just a few weeks ago, we announced that we had acquired BiancaMed, a leading, high technology, Irish company. BiancaMed, we've had an association with them from -- which goes back to 2003 when we initially invested in them. So we know them very, very well. And again, the acquisition of BiancaMed brings in 2 very, very qualified engineers. They're Conor Hanley and Conor Heneghan. Conor Hanley has a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Pen [Pennsylvania], and Conor Hannigan has a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia. They're both very talented people, and again, we see them helping us beyond the BiancaMed acquisition. ", "However, BiancaMed itself has developed and is marketing an innovative, convenient, noncontact device to one of the sleep and breathing in the home and hospital. BiancaMed's SleepMinder is an accurate, touchfree device that measures sleep and breathing with sophisticated biometric software, also using Doppler. The core of BiancaMed's proprietary technology is a motion sensor that can detect respiration and movement without physical contact with the body. The company is developing a number of other applications for this technology across a wide range of medical and consumer settings, and we'll have more to say later about the consumer aspects of it. But we're actually quite excited about that. BiancaMed will become a part of ResMed's newly created Ventures and Initiatives unit, which will now be run by Jim Hollingshead. There may be questions on that, and we're happy to talk about it. ", "With each of these transactions, the CareFusion, the Gr\u00fcndler and BiancaMed, we're adding external expertise in strategically important areas. And although they are not yet material contributors to our short-term financial results, we're very confident they'll add value in the years to come. ", "On the home testing front in the Americas, interest in HST continues to evolve. HST increased significantly, actually doubling in fiscal 2011. And we now believe it's somewhere in the vicinity of 10%, maybe a little more of sleep test volumes. And we'll continue to expand due to patient convenience and commercial pairs pushing HST, although that push has not yet been broadly enforced. And many of you probably saw the recent announcement by United Healthcare in which United is now requiring prior authorization for attended polysomnography and encouraging the use of HST. This is early days, and a recent external report suggested that maybe the tipping point could be 18 months to 2 years away. One doesn't know about that, but we are seeing a definite and increasing interest in HST. Why? Because it's far more effective. It's far more efficient. It's done immediately, and it's certainly far less expensive, probably over all about 1/3 the cost of going through PSG and pressure setting in the lab. So we see this continuing, and we see it being driven primarily by the insurers. ", "We also expect growth to result from continued and improved awareness and validation of the critical role that sleep-disordered breathing plays in the very serious, most rapidly growing and most costly diseases in the world, namely cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes, as well as, of course, obesity, which hits just about all the bases anyway. Increasingly, there is evidence coming to light that early intervention in the treatment of sleep-disorder breathing will not only slow or prevent the progression of these co-morbidities, it actually treats the co-morbidities. And we're very, very excited about this data, although very early days, of course. In fact, just last month, the American Heart Association published new research demonstrating that LSA can cause changes in blood vessel function in the endothelium that reduces blood supply to the heart in people who are otherwise quite healthy. The research showed that treatment with 26 weeks of CPAP improved study participants' blood supply but also a function of the blood vessels. This adds to other smaller studies showing blood vessel abnormalities in untreated sleep-disordered breathing patients. On that note, I'm happy to report that the 800 patients -- 800th patient has been enrolled in our survey chip study, which of course is being conducted in Europe, mainly Germany, and to a lesser extent, France.", " ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Brett, who can provide some additional detail on the financials, and then we'll attempt to take care of your questions. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the June quarter, as Peter mentioned, were $341.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter. Favorable currency movements added approximately $17.8 million to our Q4 revenue. So in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%. Income from operations for the quarter were $66.7 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $58.5 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.37, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. And excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.39. ", "Gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%, broadly consistent with Q3 FY '11. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix, offset by ASP declined and an unfavorable geographic mix. Currency impacts on a sequential basis were relatively neutral this quarter. ", "Looking forward in Q1 FY '12, the appreciation of the Australian dollar will negatively impact our gross margin by around 100 basis points. However, assuming there's no other currency movements, we expect initiatives targeted at reducing product costs to its supply chain efficiencies and manufacturing improvements, together with a favorable product mix trend, should lead to an improvement in gross margin in the second half of FY '12 compared to the first half of FY '12. ", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $102.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 13%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.9% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.8%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.9% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.8%. ", "Looking forward, and again, subject to currency, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strength of the Australian dollar and also the continued investment in our product pipeline. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.9 million for the quarter, and stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to the year ago quarter effective tax rate of 26.1%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 25.3%, while we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will also be in the vicinity of 25%. ", "Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $182.8 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $159.1 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, with currency movements having a positive impact on revenues. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 8% over the prior year quarter. ", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generated sales were $82.8 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. As expected, our growth this quarter was positively impacted by the launch of our S9 bilevel platform. Masks and other sales were $100 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions from our FX range of Masks and continued growth in accessories. ", "For revenue outside the Americas, flow generated sales were $108.4 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Masks and other sales were $50.7 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generated sales increased by 5%, while Masks and other increased by 20%. ", "Cash flow from operations was $74.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $17.4 million, while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.5 million. We continue to buy back shares as part of our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for consideration of $64 million. For the full year, we repurchased 4.9 million shares for consideration of $160.1 million. As of today, we have approximately 9.3 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $635 million. And at 30 June, total assets stood at $2.1 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion. ", "I will now hand the call back to the operator for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Yes, I guess just a question regarding the commentary around the gross margins for fiscal 2012. So you're at about 58% for the fourth quarter. So you're seeing that you expect another 100-basis-point decline, but things should get better in the second half of 2012. Does that mean we should be modeling roughly 57% range for at least the next 2 quarters? Am I hearing that correctly or not?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, Michael, it was actually 58.2%, so that will be aimed to 58.1%. But as you know, it's a complicated equation with geographic mix. And in this particular instance with the very encouraging growth in the U.S. market, which was 14%, where the prices tend to be a little lower, that obviously impacted the figure, but let me throw it to Brett for some more granular input.", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure. Mike, this is Brett. Yes, I mean, what we want to call out is, we're coming up with some pretty strong headwinds on the currency, particularly the Australian dollar, obviously. So that's going to have quite a big impact. But as Peter said, there's a lot of other factors that play out on the margin, product mix, geographic mix, manufacturing improvements we have in supply chain and so on. So on a sequential basis, in the short term, I think we've definitely got some opportunities there where we'll do better than that. But on far more comprehensive work-through on some of the initiatives we have that, that will start to impact the margin, particularly in the second half. So I'm not saying that some of those won't manifest in the first half. I think some of them will. But certainly, we think that will be stronger in the second half. And it's a pretty significant headwind we're facing just in terms of the Aussie dollar. But as you know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world at the moment, so -- that all the dollar could do anything at the moment. So we're just trying to give you a little more color around that, but rest assured that we're working pretty hard on initiatives to expand that margin.", "Michael Matson", "Okay. But just to make sure I'm understanding it correctly, you're kind of saying that there'll be 100-basis-point hit, which would be -- that's sort of a baseline, and you're going to try to improve things from there, right?", "Brett Sandercock", "Correct. Correct.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay. All right. And then that's off of the fourth quarter level, right? Not the full year 2011 level?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, sequentially from fourth quarter.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay. All right. And then I just have kind of a high-level strategic question. Given the management changes, given the Venture group that you've established, are you trying to -- it seems like you're trying to further diversify the company. And is -- can I read anything into that about what you're seeing in terms of long-run growth in the sleep apnea market or sleep-disordered breathing market? And in the longer run, do you intend to become sort of a broad respiratory play, more akin to what the old respironics used to be like?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, Michael, I think a general feeling is that not being in the hospital market, we're sort of leaving money on the table. So that's certainly part of the equation. And if you look at that, we spent quite a bunch of money on R&D in the ventilation spot. Geoff Nelson may want to add some more flavor here, Geoff being the President of the Respiratory Care Strategic Business Unit. But we thought we would just leave the money on the table. And the good news is that outside the United States, we're actually doing not so badly in the institutional environment. But in the U.S., we were nowhere. We were literally nowhere. And it was just happenstance, I guess, with Kieran going to CareFusion and having a very good feel for the amount of effort and time we put into the ventilation space, and it just fitted nicely with the gap that they had. So we're kind of encouraged by that. But on the broader -- in the broader picture, those strategic initiatives that we referred to, taking no particular order of priority, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or more specifically overlap syndrome, where a patient has upper airway instability, plus needs some help with ventilation, that's an area where we see huge potential, roughly 30 million patients in that space. And of that, roughly 1/3 of them having overlap syndrome. That's 10 million people, which are not, we don't believe, being effectively addressed. The second area is, if you like, both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular. In other words, taking into account, transient ischemic attack, stroke. 75% of both TIA and stroke patients have sleep-disordered breathing. We have enough data to know that if you don't treat the sleep-disordered breathing after a patient has either a TIA or a stroke, you're not going to effectively treat them. We need, obviously, to educate neurologists in that space, and we've got plans to do so. In the cardiovascular space, everybody is pretty much now familiar with the connection to atrial fibrillation. And of course congestive heart failure I mentioned, the 800th patient having been added to the survey chip program, and we had unbelievably good results with Adaptive-Servo Ventilation across the globe. That is the sales of the S9 Adaptive-Servo Ventilative products, really, really, really encouraging growth there. And we see that continuing. And obviously, there's also drug-resistant hypertension. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, you've heard me talk about Diabetes -- type 2 Diabetes before. We're working with the Joslin Institute at Harvard. We also have plans to not just work with them, but we've just recently had 2 key opinion leader dinners with international Endocrinologists. There are only about 5,000 in the U.S., so it's not hard to target. And we're kind of excited. The good news is that with our current chuckwagon, we've got all the products we need. Because basically, that's a play with HST and the S9 order set. I mean, that's really the best way to address the issue. And recent data are showing a huge number of patients in that space, 26 million full-blown diabetics in the country, of which 90% are type 2 diabetes. But more importantly or more disturbingly, another 79 million have metabolic syndrome. In other words, you can't tick the box if they're full-blown diabetic patients. But that's 105 million, so take out the 10% type 1s, that's in the 90 -- mid-90 millions of people, of which 80% have sleep-disordered breathing. So we see this as a wonderful opportunity to reduce the expense of the current healthcare system. Then we've got the perioperative care. There's a big meeting coming up in October 14 in Chicago, the Society of Anesthesiology and Sleep Medicine. We were important catalysts in getting that meeting set up. And finally, of course, there's Occupational Health and Safety with truck drivers, railway drivers, pilots and so on and so forth, air traffic controllers and what have you. And we're making really good headwind in those spaces. So it's a long winded,really long winded answer to your question, but in those 5 areas, we'll be making continued investments. And we've got a very strong balance sheet as you know, as Brett said, $635 million net cash. And we are going strategically use that to invest in small technology-based companies where we can direct them into areas that we think are important. And we can take an equity position in them not to make money on the equity. In fact, you could even look at it more as a marketing expense, but to direct them into areas that we think is important and hopefully allow us to kick the ball down the field a little more efficiently and effectively. So sorry for the long-winded answer, but it was an important question.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Just final question for Brett. This should be pretty quick. Can you quantify what the actual EPS impact of the currency was in the current quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Michael, for Q4, it's approximately $0.02.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Positive or negative?", "Brett Sandercock", "Negative.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Prior with Merrill Lynch.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch", "First question on U.S. flow gen growth. Can you delineate or give us any kind of sense as to the growth rate, say, into the CPAP versus APAP? And previously, you've talked about CPAP growing single-digit, APAP growing at double-digit, especially with the trend in home sleep testing. Are we seeing that deviation in growth rate get even bigger? And do you expect that to accelerate in fiscal '12?", "Peter Farrell", "It's just, really, Matt, a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. In other words, we're seeing a significant growth flowing in the escape the lower-priced units. And the good news is, of course, the clubs are basically the same. But a switch to the order set is definitely occurring. We believe we'll get more data as we go forward, obviously. We've been seeing this is the third quarter that we've seen this. And back to that visit I made to Jonathan Schwartz out in Oklahoma City. Jonathan has a huge sleep program, and he's an exclusive S9 order set user. And he was telling me that it's made him a better physician, he's moved away from the fixed order set completely. And if he's representative, and we believe he is, of what's happening, there's going to be less sales, we believe, in the noncompliance CPAP. The figure he gave me was that, with the SA products -- and the good news is he's been an exclusive ResMed user, and he's a big user for quite a while. So we have really, really tight statistics in terms of compliance. By the way, he said he's compliant. And I'll give you more granularity here, but his compliance was 90% using the S9 order set. I mean, that's an astounding figure. We'd say anything above 75% is magic. So he's getting very, very good compliance. But what he said was that using the S9 order set where we tweaked the algorithm even beyond the S8 -- the S8 was a great product, but this is a magic product -- and he was telling us how good the algorithm was. And his usage of bilevel, that is the noncompliant CPAP, percentage has gone from 15% to 5%. And we are seeing this as well. We're seeing very good growth in the ST, STA and the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation space. In fact, the ASV is just mind bogglingly excellent. I don't want to share what those numbers are, but they brought tears to our eyes. And we're seeing a slowing down of the VPAP S and a slowing down of the low-level CPAP units, but they're all moving to higher-priced devices. And that trend, we see that continuing particularly with the growth of HST.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Great. And I guess just a follow-up question, maybe for Brett. I guess, Brett, with this positive mix to APAP or to CPAP and of course, within the mix of bilevel, and then of course, the launch of the Stellar series in the U.S., which should, again, be margin accretive. As I understand, are these the kind of things that should naturally mitigate this gross margin expansion in the second half of fiscal '12 as that'll still lift with CareFusion and bilevel recovers more so?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. I think that's right. We've got -- I think if you look through the product mix and that has been stable for us for a little while now. We see that continuing. We saw some of those trends that Peter articulated, and just sort of moving up their complexity chain, I suppose, in the more sophisticated product. And with that, generally, a better margin as well. And I think there's no reason to believe that trend won't continue.", "Peter Farrell", "This is Peter, Matt, a word of caution there. I mean, we're not releasing the Stellar 150 until fourth quarter calendar year. And new product launches, as we said earlier, I mean, it's not like a binary thing 0 to 1. I mean, it takes a while for people to test them out and see how good they are. So there's no question that it's going to help, but the rate of which it's going to help, of course, is in the lap of the gods.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Sure. My question varies more, but basically this  current trend, it's not like you have to chase extra cost out initiatives to offset the effects?", "Peter Farrell", "Right, it's healthy.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Is that correct?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, that's right, Matt. We're working on that all the in terms of the cost initiative as well. We're not standing still, so we'll continue with those programs as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Claire with Piper Jaffrays.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Yes. I was just hoping, Peter, to maybe dive a little bit deeper into the CareFusion Agreement, When do you think we should see this make a contribution to results in the Americas here? And if you could give us an update on sales force training, and just how the whole agreement is going so far?", "Peter Farrell", "I'm going to try that to Jeff, but just make a comment. It is a 5-year agreement, and it just involves at the moment, Stellar 100 and the Stellar 150. And of course, they have FDA approval, but we have to train their people. And I mean, the good news for us is we are relatively happy with the volumes that they've told us they can do. It's not going to change our lives, but it's a reasonably comforting figure, and we're happy with the margins and the pricing. And as I said, it's a 5-year agreement. But it is going to take a while to ramp up. Obviously, we've got to train their people and they're going through their own internal changes as well. But over to Geoff, because Geoff was the guy who negotiated -- primarily, negotiated the agreement. So Geoff, would you like to add some comment?", "Geoff Neilson", "Yes, so we signed the agreement a couple of weeks ago. The training with their sales force is scheduled for September, and we imagine that we're going to be launching that in our Q2. There's going to be a period of sampling and so on, so we don't think we'll see immediate results. The market size is around about $85 million for noninvasive institutional ventilation. CareFusion, they're obviously a strong player in that market, but there's a very strong established player with R&D and the ventilation in these markets, so it's not going to change overnight.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe a quick one for Brett here. The 3% growth that we saw in the Americas, is there any way you could tease out, say, volume versus price versus mix? Was volume still positive overall or how are things shaping up there?", "Brett Sandercock", "Well, I mean, I don't want to get too granular on what we're looking there. I mean, if the volumes were positive. And the volumes, like it traditionally done, run a few points ahead of revenues, so that trend's still there as well.", "Peter Farrell", "So, David, we normally figure a 5% decrement in ASPs. And it was of that order. In some cases, a little higher, but about where we expected it to be.  So to Brett's point, yes, the volumes were higher than the revenues.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay. And then just one more quick one here, can you tell us about the leadership change at ResMed Ventures?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes. JC was, as you know, running sales and marketing in the Americas. And the result of discussions of the board was that he should be off at the ResMed Ventures and Initiatives. And this happened fairly quickly. I was on vacation last week and came in Monday morning, and I was planning to have a discussion with JC about the 3 areas I mentioned, the cardiac and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular and perioperative care/risk and the Type 2 diabetes. And he said, well, before we do that, I'd  just like to mention that I've accepted another position. And as we talked it through -- look, one of the things that concerned us initially was when you looked at what Jim Hollingshead was doing in the strategy part of our business, and what JC was planning to do, you had about a 75% to 80% overlap, and it looked a little crazy on paper. I wasn't worried about it because the idea of ResMed Ventures and Initiatives is that, that's going to become a P&L responsibility, and that would leave the strategy group just focusing on the future. And the near-term future would be the P&Ls and all the Adaptive-Servo Ventilation business was going to go through there. Narval was going to report through JC. That's the mandibular repositioning device, and also BiancaMed was going to report in. However, it turned out that all the negotiations with BiancaMed were done by Jim Hollingshead, anyway. And Jim is right across the Narval business. And people, internally, were concerned about a little bit about of overlap, I mean, it was not just a little bit, it was 75% to 80%. And therefore, but I said don't worry because this is very quickly, and that's the goal I wanted JC to work on, is turning more of those areas into P&L activities. And JC said, \"Look, I've come from a P&L environment with 400-or-so people. And here, I've got to build from ground 0.\" And he said, \"As I thought about it, I just wasn't comfortable.\" So he actually approached CareFusion. So it wasn't like Kieran saying, \"Gee, I'll take all the boys that I can.\" It wasn't that at all. JC approached him, and I think he's got an absolutely fabulous job. And it took like a nanosecond to say, \"Wow, that's good for him.\" And Jim is all across the ResMed Ventures and Initiatives. So he's the perfect guy to run that group. And I think it's a good outcome all-around. And certainly, no hard feelings. I mean, JC is a great guy. He did a terrific job. He came in with a huge challenge 3.5 years ago. We had only increased year-over-year 5%, and then he brought it up to double-digits and did a great job. And we wished him well, and I think he's going to do a great job.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I was curious if you have kind of a thought in terms of volume trajectory from here? Do you see things kind of steady as we look at OSA volume growth in '12 in the U.S. and in Europe, trying to isolate that from some of the other dynamics? Or do you see things kind of decelerating with the economy looking a little strange?", "Peter Farrell", "It's difficult looking into a crystal ball, you don't know what the heck is happening there. Just about everything you hear about the U.S. economy is highly negative. I mean, I think the debt ceiling bill was partially a joke. I mean, you increase the debt ceiling and you'll get a team together and take a look at what you're going to chop out. I mean, there needs to be complete structural change in the U.S., but obviously, we're not on a position to drive that, so we've just got to take what we get. The pundits are suggesting -- the lowest figure I've seen in terms of growth in the U.S. market for devices is 5%, Phillips is looking more like 8%. So you can say 5% to 8%. We would say that it's probably high-single digits, maybe a 7%, something like that 7% or 8%. So given our growth, we feel that we're taking market share. Just what the real number for growth is, we don't know. I think there's going to be a bit of a fill-up from HST. We're confident that's going to happen. Sleep labs are still growing, albeit slowly, maybe a 5% figure will be the lowest, probably closer to 7%, maybe as high as 8%. But that's our expectation, and that's what we're going with. If it's different, it'll be different. But that's what we think it's going to be.", "Craig Collie - Macquarie Research", "Fine. My second question is, if generator growth in the quarter was about 3%, bilevels were flat versus down over 20%, do you see yourself in an accelerating share-taking move as the next quarter comes in? Because it always took up a couple of quarters to fully launch a new generator. And so are things going to improve over the course of '12 relative to the market? Or are you sort of at your stride and you'll maybe hold that share gain position where it is?", "Peter Farrell", "That's a good question. And we tend to be a little conservative, I think. And flattish would be a good call, we think. If there's an uptick -- we certainly have stopped the leaky sieve. There's no question about that. It's some very, very encouraging numbers. It's a great product. It's being received according to what our expectations were, which is a good thing. So what we thought was going to happen, did happen. And we think it's going to continue. But we don't feel that there's going to be an acceleration. We think there will be an uptick, and it's just like watch this space -- we've stopped the hemorrhaging in the bilevels for sure. But the trends towards away from lower price CPAP to what I said we believe is going to continue, we think we're going to see a slowing of the noncompliant CPAP, that is the bilevel Ss, the VPAP S. And we see good growth still occurring with the ST, the STA and certainly Adaptive-Servo Ventilation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd", "If I could keep on with the devices, if you look to Europe, just wondering with your growth there, how significant was the contribution from ventilation sales in the quarter?", "Peter Farrell", "We only just launched, I mean, the Stellar 100 -- look, it's going to according to our expectations, but we haven't seen the huge acceleration in bilevels in ROW as yet. And maybe I'll turn that to Geoff. I mean, Geoff's been looking very, very carefully at the market. So Geoff, do you want to make a comment about our growth in ventilation and expectations?", "Geoff Neilson", "Sure. So I think if you look at our Elysian VS [ph] range, they have a strong position in Homecare in Europe. We just launched Stellar in the -- one quarter ago. And so we've got one quarter results. It's been growing month-over-month. That's now a significant contributor in terms of its getting up to revenues that we're approaching, some of the other products increasing in Europe. But there's a way to go yet. And I think you know with ventilation is it takes longer than the sleep products in order to establish. So I think the growth we see is lower. And we still got to relatively low market shares in the institutions in Europe, and so that's some of the work we've got ahead of us.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd", "Right. I mean, I suppose what I was also trying to get at is you sort of said that devices were growing about 7% in constant currency in the rest of world. Is RFO growing faster or slower than that?", "Peter Farrell", "We think that's about what it's growing at, I would say. We have now more granular understanding of that area, I would say 7 -- I'd be confident it's not going to go below that. And if you ask me what I think is going to happen as we go forward, I'd say it's probably going to go towards 10%. So we're comfortable with the things that are going okay in Europe and Asia Pacific.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd", "Good. And so my second question, can I ask about the Mask business, obviously growing very strongly. Could you just comment, how much of that is you winning market share? And how much of that do you think is people trying to -- sort of get their numbers of Masks per annum up?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, the way I would sort of answer that is we are seeing just wonderful acceptance for the Forex platform. We are the king of the castle in full-faced masks. And the Quattro FX, which Don Back [ph] and his team developed is just really a great product. It's a fabulous product. The Mirage FX, we were getting -- frankly, our tail was getting kicked in the nasal mask category. We were gradually losing market share there, and we were well below 50% of the market. This is such a great product. We like the COGS. We like the way it fits 90-plus percent first time fit. And we are -- the biggest job that we've made in the Masks has been with the nasal Mirage FX. And it's just very encouraging. We love the product, and in fact, Jonathan Schwartz, I may mention, that I spend the day with him and we talked to a dozen patients who were on treatment. The bulk of them were on the Mirage FX. And he said, \"This is the best product you guys have ever put out.\" I think he's exaggerating. We think we have lots and lots of good products. But he was absolutely over the moon. He said, \"It is at least 100% better than any other nasal mask that you guys have put out.\" Be that as it may, that's where our most significant growth has come from. And of course, we're the king of the castle also with nasal pillow. So you've got the full-face masks, and you've got the nasal pillows where we've traditionally been in the very high -- very, very high percentages. And we're in the very low percentage area, around 30% in the nasal category. And we've seen a big, big jump up there. And that, I think, is the major change.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd", "So you haven't seen any change from what you can sort of get from general feedback on the number of masks that patients are using per annum?", "Peter Farrell", "It's a very, very -- oh, per annum? We're still seeing figures of north of 1 but below 2. And that's a great -- a big area where we see we can make some inroads. And the data, I think -- you want to say anything about that, Nick? No? So it's sub-2, it's above 1, total 1.5. And that's -- we know even the worst insurers will allow you to have 3 masks a year, CMS-4. And that's obviously an area -- replenishment is an area which has a lot of potential for growth. But just to give you an idea, we would sell 5x as many masks as we do devices. So it's very hard to work out just where they're going. It's replacement. It's being used on other guys' devices. It's our devices. I mean, since we're not selling, in most cases, direct to customers, it's almost impossible to work out when you've got a ratio of 5:1, just where the Masks are ending up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just touching on the rest of world growth, if I could get you to talk about, geographically, were there any particular countries that were better or worse than you've seen in trend terms?", "Peter Farrell", "There was nothing that spooked us there at all. I mean, constant currency was 8%. Asia Pac tends to be a little lumpy. Obviously, when you've got a distributor in Japan, it's obviously a big part of Asia Pac, and there was a bit of a hiccup, as you know, with the tsunami and so forth. Japan tends to be lumpy anyway, but when you have such a big customer like Teijin, obviously that's going to continue to be lumpy. Germany is our biggest market outside the U.S. Germany is going along pretty well. France is going along very well. And then you've got a smattering of Norway, Sweden, and so forth, the Middle East and the U.K. and so forth. There's been nothing there that spooked us in terms of growth rates in either Germany or France, our 2 biggest markets. And the lumpiness that we expect from Asia Pac still continues. But nothing...", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG", "Low constant currency growth of ROW numbers, you'd be comfortably going back to around the 10% level on average?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes. I must say, I was even a little surprised at the 8%. I would have expected 10%. But in talking to Stein, I had to check to him this morning. Stein Jacobson who runs our European operations, and nothing that's spooking him.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG", "But I guess the fear with Europe in particular  is that there's going to be funding pressure. Now, my sense is we haven't really seen much impact from that. I was just leary as to whether that was an explanation in this quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "David, Brett. Europe still remains pretty solid particularly across our emerging markets. And really, if you look at that CC growth rate, Asia Pac, that region was actually a drag on that this quarter. So they experienced low growth there. That was predominantly with Japan, and you now have some of the issues that we've had with the earthquake and so on. And as Peter said, it is traditionally lumpy. So, yes, I don't think there's anything to read into this particular quarter on that. Europe remains pretty solid and Asia Pac, lumpy as ever. But Japan is probably working through some of their issues, as well, in terms of their own country issues around the earthquake and so on. So overall, we still remain pretty pleased with the rest of the world growth.", "Peter Farrell", "David, let me make one other comment there, which David Pendarvis just reminded me of, and it is a big thing. We launched the S9 in France and Germany this time last year, and it went gangbuster. So we had just dreadful comparables, if you like, with a new product that everybody loved. Bingo. We had huge growth the previous year, so we had a huge mountain to climb. So that's the reason that it was softer than what one might expect.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes, now that's a very fair point. Just one other question then. Just on the acquisitions, so we've seen a couple of small acquisitions. Can I get you to talk about what to the level of spending or what the cost has been, or what you expect to spend there over the next 12 months?", "Peter Farrell", "It's factored in. We said that the BiancaMed -- look, Grundler is making money. In terms of revenues, we're talking about a few million. And we don't have FDA approval for Grundler products in the United States. So how long's that going to take? How long is a piece of string sort of thing? We will be seeking FDA approval, obviously. We need to do it. We will do it. But they are making money, so there's not going to be a hit from the Grundler acquisition. And as we said when we bought BiancaMed, it's roughly $0.04 for the year with BiancaMed. And I don't think it's going to be any different. Maybe, Brett, you might want to add some more to that but...", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess I was trying to understand how much you're spending. So $635 million of cash on the balance sheet is something we've always looked at with great interest as to what the plans are. We've seen these acquisitions, I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether we're going to see $100 million go into acquisitions or is it going to become like...", "Peter Farrell", "Yes. We don't have anything immediately on the plate that we're looking at to be candid, but that doesn't mean there won't be. $100 million acquisition could happen, could happen. But there is nothing -- there's nothing that we're -- we're very familiar with Grundler and we're very familiar with BiancaMed. There are no other similar type companies that we've been working with for a long time that we're about to make an offer on. On the other hand...", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG", "Outside the buybacks, the cash level continues to go up?", "Peter Farrell", "Yes. Yes, outside the -- Yes. But look, let me tell you that we are looking very carefully as to how we should deploy it. So I could say now, we're not sort of putting the ruler over a number of other companies, but we intend to, that's for sure. And Jim Hollingshead, who's currently in India, when he gets back we'll be taking a good hard look of the terrain and seeing what's there that might help us move the ball down the field.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour mark, so we'll turn the call back over to Dr.  Peter Farrell for his final remarks.", "Peter Farrell", "Well, thank you all for joining. And let me just say that we continue to be excited by -- as we look out into the future. Innovative products rolling out over the year. We're especially excited about the FX Masks and the new S9 platform. The market for our sleep-disordered breathing is still highly under-penetrated. We have a robust balance sheet, which we just talked about. We're certainly generating cash in the vicinity of $0.25 billion a year. And finally, we have an absolutely first-rate team of people to assure continuing strong execution. And I want to thank all the staff, particularly those that are listening, for their commitment and loyalty. And we see great things happening in the sleep industry, and also within the company, and we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress.

[Operator instructions.] The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. ", "Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward looking statements such as projections for future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company\u2019s products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed\u2019s SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company\u2019s website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead sir.", "Peter Farrell ", "Thanks operator, and thanks everybody for joining us. I\u2019ll begin with some summary comments and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, and then we\u2019ll take questions and I might bring some of the other guys in as needed.", "First, the finance. We finished with what we think is a very solid quarter. Global revenue grew 12% to $315 million, or 8% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew by 9% year over year to $169.3 million, and ROW revenue increased by 15% to $145.5 million, which was 7% on a constant currency basis.", "US GAAP EPS decreased to $0.33 for the quarter, but let me quickly mention this was primarily impacted by forex and Brett will go into that in a little more detail. But it was a significant impact. And if we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, the hybrid EPS was $0.35, which matched First Call\u2019s expectations.", "In looking at product category performance, let me start first with masks and accessories. The results in this category continue to perform well across the globe, and we continue to take share. The three new mask offerings, the 4X trilogy, the Quattro, the Mirage, and the Swift FX, continue to do very well. ", "We also just recently launched versions of all of the FX series masks for women, in our Choices for Her program. This popular family of masks, which are lightweight, unobtrusive, and comfortable, offers female-friendly versions of all three categories with fitting and comfort options especially with women in mind. And I believe we are the first company to design a mask simply for female patients. ", "We also launched the first pediatric mask in the industry, developed specifically for the treatment of sleep disordered breathing in children, in this case age 2 and older. This is not just a scaled-down adult mask. Every feature of the new Pixie was designed to address and improve comfort acceptance with both child and caregiver in mind. ", "With the new Pixie nasal mask, we now have three options to meet the needs of children with sleep disordered breathing. And, by combining the new Stellar 100 ventilator with the Pixie nasal mask, we now offer an ideal pediatric therapy solution, particularly in either a hospital or institutional care setting.", "One reason we continue to see strong growth in masks and accessories other than our new products is that even in this very challenging economy there is excellent business in the resupply or replenishment of masks to existing patients, and we are working with our customers, the HMEs, to leverage this significant business opportunity.", "Now, moving to devices, our global growth in sleep therapy devices was mainly driven by sales of the S9 AutoSet, as well as our adaptive servo ventilation offerings the VPAP Adapt and the AutoSet CS. ", "Growth in the rest of the flow generator segment was problematic, especially in the low-end products, as was reported for the previous couple of quarters. This continues to be a challenging environment, especially in the Americas, as everybody knows in the medtech space. But on top of that, we had tough comps, and in addition, the Q1 for us, the September quarter, is always a challenge because of France and Germany vacation issues.", "So it\u2019s a difficult macroeconomic environment, but one of the key reasons for some impact on the top line was that we chose to walk away from business because it was uneconomic. So in other words, we intentionally left significant potential revenue on the top line. We left money on the table, but we think it was the right call. However, while flow generator sales were softer than expected in the Americas, Europe still posted fairly good results. ", "A few weeks ago, ResMed introduced the S9 AutoSet for Her, within the Choices for Her program. Offering the quiet comfort of the S9, the Easy Breathe motor, and the enhanced AutoSet algorithm, the S9 for Her ensures that the sleep environment for a woman will remain quiet and peaceful. ", "And in addition, there is the H5i, the humidifier with climate control, which also has been designed with her in mind. It\u2019s also interesting to note that we think the timing on this makes a lot of sense, because the latest statistics show that 40% of the newly diagnosed sleep patients are actually women.  ", "This quarter, we\u2019ve also taken the initiative to engage existing patients through personalization of CPAP devices. And in this case, we have an exclusive agreement with a company called Skinit, that literally makes skins for various devices, iPods, cellphones, and so on. ", "Skins represent a unique way to personalize a device, to get SDB patients more intimately connected with their machine, which we hope, or anticipate, may even help to drive compliance. Skins may also create a way to help patients reconnect with therapy and potentially bring them back to treatment if they\u2019re being non-compliant. ", "Therapy adherence not only drives patient health, which is the primary goal, it is also a good business, as it provides an accessories revenue stream for the HME and may also provide consumer pull for ResMed products. And thus far, even though we\u2019re only a couple of weeks into the skins program, or the Skinit initiative, thus far physicians and HMEs both are incredibly enthusiastic for the product.", "In short, with S9 products for her, Skinit, and Pixie, we continue to address the needs of a wide range of patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing. Now let me switch to ventilation. Sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow progressively in Europe and parts of Asia, but as people would understand, it takes time to launch a new product. But Stella is meeting our expectations.", "We recently highlighted the Stella 150 with iVAPS at the European Respiratory Society meeting in September and we\u2019ll launch it globally around the end of this calendar year. And both these products will also be launched in Asia. Our first sales will be in December, for the 150, and then later, early in the calendar, 2012, we will be releasing the Stella 100.", "Of note, the Stella 150 includes, as I mentioned, iVAPS, which is our new automatic bi-level mode. The success of the Stella is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development, and we\u2019re very satisfied with the way it\u2019s been received. ", "And if people would be aware, we have signed an agreement with CareFusion. Their team went through training in late September, and we\u2019ve had feedback that they\u2019re fairly enthusiastic about the Stella products.", "As announced in August, we also acquired Greundler Medical GmbH, a German developer and distributor of humidification products, and we are delighted with the acquisition. The integration is going well, and we just launched the latest product, the HumiCare D900, also at the ERS in September.", "This product has additional innovations in terms of its ability to produce high levels of ventilation in a quick timeframe. There is considerable excitement around this product, and we are fairly optimistic. It also nicely positions us in the hospital environment, and we are now looking at distribution channels and how we might integrate them to make this product available worldwide. A controlled product release is planned for this product, HumiCare D900, later this quarter.", "Another small acquisition was BiancaMed. The integration there is going well, and we met with a large consumer products company in Japan last week and the technology from the BiancaMed product called the SleepMinder will be launched as part of a wellness program and in fact it\u2019s not just a Japanese consumer products company that is well known, but also an extremely well known U.S. consumer product brand. That will happen towards the end of this calendar year and early in 2012.", "On the home sleep testing front, in the Americas, commercial payers continue to steer HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attendant PSG or polysomnography. In short, HST is being encouraged, and the momentum continues with major payers steering providers to this diagnostic procedure. We are now beginning to see trends where payers are moving towards utilization management of positive airway pressure devices as a result of removing diagnostic barriers. We see a continuing uptick in the adoption of HST.", "Let me also add some final flavor. I had mentioned being in Japan last week. I was actually at the World Sleep Congress, and was delighted to see that Japanese cardiologists and endocrinologists are embracing sleep disordered breathing to the extent that they are actually integrating sleep diagnostics into their practices. ", "Given the prevalence of SDB in cardiac disease and Type II diabetes mellitus, this seems to make a lot of practical sense, and it will be interesting to see if this is adopted by other countries, particularly the U.S., Germany, and France.", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett, who can provide additional detail on the financials, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Brett? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks Peter. As Peter mentioned, revenue for the September quarter was $314.8 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Currency movements added approximately $10.6 million to our Q1 revenues, so in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%.", "Income from operations for the quarter was $60.9 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $50.5 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior year quarter. ", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.33, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter. Compared to the prior year, unfavorable currency movements reduced the September quarter\u2019s EPS by approximately $0.08. If currency rates had remained consistent with the prior year, earnings per share would have increased by approximately 14%.", "Gross margin for the September quarter was 58.8%, up sequentially from Q4 FY11. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from improvements in manufacturing and logistics costs and favorable geographic mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts.", "Looking forward, for the balance of FY12, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60%, subject of course to currency movements. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product cost through supply chain efficiencies, product design, and manufacturing improvements.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $94.2 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 29.9% compared to the year ago figure of 30.1%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $26.2 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 18%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.3% compared to the year ago figure of 7%. Again, looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012. This reflects both the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline.", "As a result of several acquisitions this quarter, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.8 million for the quarter, while stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.2 million.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 25.9%.

", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator instructions.] And your first question today comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Merrill Lynch. ", "Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch", "Just a quick question in regard to the growth rate. I think it\u2019s going to be the focus of today\u2019s results given the slowdown you\u2019ve seen on the low end. Can you talk to whether that growth rate of 7% that you spoke to last quarter has changed, and if so, try and split that out between the U.S. and Europe in terms of industry growth rates before you move on to the individual product segments. ", "Peter Farrell", "Matt, the 7% figure, 6-8%, we think is still the right number. We\u2019re kind of optimistic that maybe we\u2019ll see an increase as we go forward. There\u2019s no guarantee there, but we think that that was about what it was for the quarter just finished. Europe may be a tad higher than that, 9-10%, so 6-8% and 9-10%, or let\u2019s say ROW. And I think those numbers are the right ones. The low-end, again, just to reiterate, we walked away from some business. We could have increased the number of flow gens, but we looked at it and said, that\u2019s not business that we really think would satisfy our shareholders. So we did leave revenues on the table, but not much money, if you like. So our numbers don\u2019t really reflect the growth rate in that sense, at the fixed CPAP level in the U.S. And as you saw in ROW, the growth rate was pretty reasonable with the flow gens. We see possible that that number will increase. In the lap of the gods, but we are reasonably optimistic. ", "Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks Peter. I guess breaking down into kind of the basic CPAP, then APAP, then bi-level, putting APAP to one side, it seems to be trucking along nicely, can you talk to what is the factor that is driving that low-end CPAP business. You talked about walking away from some of the potential revenue you could have generated there. Your gross margin\u2019s stronger than I think most of us expected, so what was it that drove you to kind of walk away from that business. Was it that it represented an unsustainable margin, so you didn\u2019t want to get into that game of maybe a lower ASP? Was it that the actual underlying patient, with the copay issue, wasn\u2019t willing to step up, and that was affecting ASP? Can you just give us some more color? ", "Peter Farrell", "I think the equation is a complicated one, and we\u2019re not sure if loss of COBRA and copays, and all that sort of thing, has an impact. But we\u2019re seeing very nice growth in the APAP space, so there are still people out there going onto treatment, and there are certainly, with the push by the payers and the HMEs feeling more comfortable driving HST, there\u2019s no question that there is a significant jump, and if you go back last year versus the year before, it\u2019s gone from about 4% to 10%, and our latest figures - and again they\u2019re a little rubbery - is that 20% of the patients going on to treatment are actually from home sleep testing, HST. ", "So there\u2019s no question that that\u2019s increasing. Therefore, that will impact obviously fixed CPAP. There is business in the fixed CPAP area, because let\u2019s face it, if you\u2019re a DME, you\u2019re an HME, you\u2019re not going on treatment, and you\u2019re getting a fixed amount of money, and if you\u2019re not looking appropriately at the business in terms of replenishment, and looking at issues such as compliance, there\u2019s no point in putting a patient onto a device and then having them become noncompliant. Because that way their health is impacted. The insurance company loses. We lose. And so does the HME, DME, because they don\u2019t get the benefit of the replenishment. The annuity which goes with patients who remain compliant. ", "So our pitch is look, don\u2019t buy cheap, because in fact it doesn\u2019t make economic sense, let alone sense in terms of patient health. But there\u2019s no question that there\u2019s an economic malaise in this place. Everybody\u2019s aware of that. I don\u2019t want to get into a political discussion here. I\u2019ll try to avoid that. But things could be better, put it that way. And I think they will improve in time. But we\u2019re happy with that 7% figure, and the reason we walked away from that business is it was just uneconomic. I mean, you\u2019re always tempted to make deals, but once you start on that slippery slope, there\u2019s no getting off it. ", "Matthew Prior - Merrill Lynch", "I guess the second part of that question, which was the bi-levels, can you talk to whether your bi-level share is still recovering? ", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah, we\u2019re really chuffed, as it were, by the growth in adaptive servo ventilation, because we went from the S7, which was really looking like a car battery to some people I guess. But to put that technology into the S9 was obviously a boon. The same is true of the bi-levels. And we are significantly into the double digits in the bi-levels, and in fact we are where we expected to be, or hoped to be, with bi-level sales. ", "However, at the low end, as I mentioned last quarter, we\u2019re seeing some loss of bi-level S business, that is the noncompliant OSA, because frankly the S9 AutoSet is so good that - and I was with a guy on the weekend, we had a ResMed Foundation board meeting, and one of the physicians who\u2019s on that board was telling me again that he\u2019s gone from something like 20-25% noncompliant CPAP on the bi-levels down to close to 5%. So I don\u2019t know how representative - that\u2019s [n=1]. He also told me that because of the performance of the S9 AutoSet he reckons everybody should be on an S9 AutoSet, and mind you we\u2019re on the same page there. So do we. But he was saying that his use of wake drugs like Provigil, NeuroVigil, and so forth, has also dropped significantly. ", "In other words, he\u2019s not seeing as many sleepy patients, and he\u2019s not seeing as many noncompliant patients. I suspect that\u2019s true across the board. We don\u2019t know that for sure, but I think that\u2019s also impacting that. But again, overall, the bi-level market, we\u2019re into double-digit growth, and we\u2019re quite happy with where we\u2019re positioned. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. ", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Following up on that question, if you talk about walking away from business, what\u2019s the effect of that? Somebody\u2019s obviously coming in and taking that business, so how do you turn that around? Or do you end up conceding that low-end segment of the market increasingly over time? ", "Peter Farrell", "Well, Ben, it\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019re faced with at the end of a quarter, and how much do you want to bend over. Now, if I\u2019m a DME or an HME, and we\u2019ve done a little bit of market segmentation and we\u2019ve looked at our customers, and the ones that tend to come in by saying, hey, listen, we\u2019ll buy a certain amount from you, but here\u2019s the price, they tend to be less driven by the patient concerns, if you like. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re completely irrelevant to them, but it\u2019s more on the basis, of hey, I\u2019m getting paid x for a machine and I\u2019m prepared to pay you y, what do you think? And do we do deals? Yes we do. Everybody in the business does deals, but there are some deals that you just simply say, no, that doesn\u2019t work for us. Now, this thing does vary quarter to quarter. I think we can get some of that business back, and we\u2019ll still continue to sell to those people, but we\u2019re not that concerned about it. We prefer to sell on quality and performance and we\u2019re happy with that space that we\u2019re in. ", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Is this at all similar to the situation four years ago where Respironics sort of cut price in a material way so they undercut the typical delta, maybe 10% between your product and theirs, and that delta became 15 or whatever, and you eventually had to sort of take a step function change?", "Peter Farrell", "You know, it\u2019s not at a level as it was four years ago. It\u2019s not quite at that level. And it\u2019s not across the board. That was more of a global thing. This is more of selected customers in selected areas, if you know what I mean.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. And then finally, if you try to build up underlying patient volume growth, and then maybe mix in price for us to get to that market growth, how would you think about those three pieces? ", "Peter Farrell", "That\u2019s a bit complicated. Don\u2019t jump off the call. [Laughter] We\u2019re saying the revenue growth is around 7% in the U.S. market, and it\u2019s a little higher than that, maybe 9% ROW. Now, we believe that within the U.S. market there\u2019s going to be a continuing trend. I mentioned the figure of 20%. That\u2019s where we think it is now, 20% of all patients going on to treatment are now in the HST space. So we\u2019re optimistic about growth in APAP in the auto set. And we still think it\u2019s going to be soft in the fixed CPAP. It will still be around, because a lot of the guys out there, there\u2019s a certain segment that just buy on price. There are plenty of others who buy on how well is the patient going to do and we\u2019re satisfied they\u2019re going to remain compliant. But it\u2019s very hard. Can you just give me a bit more understanding of your question? ", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "I\u2019m trying to get to that revenue growth number of 7%. Are you talking about patient growth of 7%, mix of 10%, and price minus 10%? ", "Peter Farrell", "It\u2019s hard to know. I\u2019ll go with the 7% revenue and I think you\u2019re probably a little bit ahead of that with patient growth, but we have factored in, and always have for the last x years, that we expect a 5% across-the-board hit in price. It\u2019s not far off that, frankly. ", "Brett Sandercock", "It\u2019s just a little bit more complicated, with HST and with APAP and so on, that trend we\u2019re seeing there that\u2019s probably been with us for a few years. Yet you go back a long time and volume would generally be higher than revenue. So it\u2019s more complex now with this sort of trend with inflow gens it seems to be heading toward higher end as well, at least how we see it. But Peter\u2019s right, in terms of ASP declines it\u2019s traditionally been around that mid-single digits. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Clair of Piper Jaffray.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "I guess the first question is maybe we can just talk about kind of trends in the quarter. Is it something that just really continued to decline throughout the quarter, or get slower throughout the quarter? Or was it just kind of a steady lower growth throughout the quarter? ", "Peter Farrell", "No, we\u2019re not selling direct to consumers, so we don\u2019t have total visibility. Let me say again about ROW that since our second and third biggest markets are Germany and France, there is always a predictable softness in the first quarter because August is your vacation month and basically labs shut down and physicians take off and let\u2019s face it this is not a heart attack, it\u2019s an elective procedure, and you\u2019re not likely to be putting the patient at risk of losing their life. At least not in a high-risk sort of way. So there is that softness there. So that can explain the ROW numbers, because of the size of the German and French revenues in our mix. As far as the U.S. goes, as we said we\u2019re seeing this trend with adoption of HST across the board and we expect that to continue. With respect to growth, generally in the quarter, the last month is always bigger than the first month, and so it\u2019s very hard to tease out growth rates. It starts slow and finishes pretty quickly. And we\u2019ve seen that for years. We try to get away from that. It would be nice to have a third, a third, a third, but that\u2019s just not the way the system works. And often, at the end of the quarter, there\u2019s not exactly a hockey stick, but there is substantially more product sold in the last month compared to the first month. And that trend, we\u2019d prefer it to be different, but that\u2019s just the way the system is. That seems to be the way HMEs and the DMEs buy. They stock up at the end of the quarter, start slow, and then run out of inventory and start buying again. And that\u2019s the cycle. ", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "And just to go back to that comment that you walked away from a little bit of business in the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of, is this something that\u2019s fairly common or has it kind of picked up this quarter or last quarter? Any commentary you can give there? ", "Peter Farrell", "Maybe Brett, I\u2019ll throw you under the bus on this one. But let me just make a comment. There are a couple of deals this quarter just finished that were unusual to me. And there\u2019s always deals at the end of a quarter, but if it becomes too crazy, we just say, fine, good luck, and have a nice rest of your life. But Brett, do you want to comment any further?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, it\u2019s just in that commercial environment you get potential deals or opportunistic things that come up and what you\u2019ve just got to do is you\u2019ve got to look at those and you\u2019ve got to balance that against what you\u2019re looking at doing in the longer term as well, rather than trying to get yourself into sort of a 90-day mentality, is to really look at that and look at the sustainability of the business and where the trends are and just look at it on its merits, and then I think it\u2019s a judgment call on what you\u2019re prepared to do and what pricing you\u2019re prepared to take. ", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and that 7% market growth figure that you guys gave, can you split that into flow gens and masks? What you think the overall markets are growing there? ", "Peter Farrell", "Well, we haven\u2019t actually tried to get granularity there, and it would be difficult to do. But if I had to take a guess, the flow gens are under 7%, a shade under, and the masks would be a shade over. Put it this way, it\u2019s an easy call to make, because trailing revenues, the machine give or take is a 5-year project, whereas a mask is a 3-6 month project. So since you\u2019ve got a fairly big base of patients out there that are being resupplied, you\u2019re always going to see much faster growth, or higher growth, with the accessories and masks. And that\u2019s just the way it is. You might replace your machine every 5 years. ", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "And then Brett, what\u2019s the manufacturing in Singapore now? What percent. ", "Brett Sandercock", "We\u2019re pretty consistently ticking up, and around a third of our production on a blended basis would be in Singapore now. And again, we expect that to increase over the course of the year as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "First of all, just wondering if you could quantify the impact of currency on your earnings per share in the quarter. ", "Peter Farrell", "I\u2019ll throw that to you, Brett. I thought Brett had handled that, Michael. ", "Brett Sandercock", "That\u2019s okay. Michael, it was $0.08 negative. ", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "And what was it last quarter, two cents negative? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, I think from memory it was two or three cents. ", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "And I guess I was just wondering what your views are on the Respironics ROIQ product. It seems sort of an interesting strategy. It\u2019s unclear how well it will do, but I guess I\u2019m a little worried that it could kind of derail the full autosetting market by offering a lower-end product that has some of the benefits of autosetting, at least in the home testing arena. ", "Peter Farrell", "You know, I hesitate to say smoke and mirrors, but I might say that if I were asked. I\u2019ll throw it to Don. Would you like to comment on that Don? ", "Don Darkin", "Yeah. We\u2019re watching this obviously closely. It\u2019s an interesting play, but again, when you think about how the HST space is going to unfold, we think it will be an interesting commercial move at the lower end, but I just don\u2019t see at this point the big impact that they\u2019re hoping for. We\u2019ll follow it through and measure it as it goes, but at this point I\u2019m not seeing it as a big deal.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "Okay. And then can you disclose what you paid for BiancaMed and the other acquisition that you did in the quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "Our 10-Q will be out in a little while, which will show that as an aggregate amount for all those acquisitions. ", "Peter Farrell", "We didn\u2019t bet the farm, if you like. They were fairly small. Together they were well under $50 million, put it that way. ", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "And can you walk through the timing on the BiancaMed product launch again? ", "Peter Farrell", "Well, we bought BiancaMed because we were working with them. We initially invested in them. We had 12% of them back in 2003, and we\u2019ve kept at that 12% level until we finally pulled the trigger and bought them. There was a VC who was interested, and they basically wanted us out of the front row. Obviously if you\u2019re a VC you want as best you can get at an auction. And they didn\u2019t want us getting any sort of special treatment. ", "We had been working with BiancaMed with a Chinese Wall if you like, and as you know two of the areas we\u2019re interested in are COPD and cardiovascular disease, and in this case, specifically, congestive heart failure. So we were developing algorithms in COPD for acute exacerbations and in CHF space for acute decompensation. Now given the cost of putting a CHF patient or COPD patient in the hospital, it\u2019s tens of thousands of dollars, and the algorithm we\u2019re working on is to give us forewarning, if you like, of respiratory disturbances, decompensation in the case of heart failure, and exacerbations in the case of COPD. And we really wanted to make sure we owned that technology. ", "So that was the real reason for buying when we did, because the VC was about to pull the trigger. Now, having said that, when we did a more of a deep dive we found that they were getting into the consumer space, and in fact there are considerable discussions with four major players in the consumer space. And they\u2019re extremely well-known names, which I\u2019m not at liberty to mention now. We\u2019ve already sold some devices to one of these, and it\u2019s a Japanese company. And there\u2019s another Japanese company that\u2019s expressing an interest, and there are two fairly big U.S. companies that are expressing interest. ", "We thought that this was really kind of an interesting potential and the more we heard about it the more we liked it. And it positions us in a quite different space, and I guess where we\u2019d like to be is that if you get on the net and put in \u201csleep apnea\u201d or \u201csleep disordered breathing\u201d ResMed pops up and starts flashing at you. We\u2019re not at that point yet, but it would be nice to think of that as a possibility. ", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "Okay, just one follow up on BiancaMed and then I\u2019ll be done. So the revenue opportunity with this acquisition, is it in this consumer element of the business? Or is it more back end loaded in some of the more longer-term medically oriented products that they\u2019re developing? ", "Peter Farrell", "Well, you know, it\u2019s very hard to predict consumer items. They can take off. If you look at iPads, iPods, everybody wants one, and bingo, the stores are all jammed with people. The play in all these spaces is wellness, and it\u2019s wellness connected with whatever else the company\u2019s pitching. And wellness now, it\u2019s not just nutrition, it\u2019s not just physical fitness, it\u2019s sleep. And so people are waking up to sleep, and these big consumers companies are saying, well, if people are waking up to sleep, we want a piece of that action. I could see either way, Michael. This could take off in the consumer space and we\u2019d be delighted if that were to happen. Our main interest, however, is in COPD and CHF and it\u2019s as an enabling tool. In other words, the COPD patients will be put on our devices and the heart failure patients will be put on our devices, and the means to that is using BiancaMed technology. So that\u2019s the main reason, but gee, if this other stuff happens, we\u2019ll be delighted.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS ", "Dan Hurren - UBS", "Just want to ask about [unintelligible] masks. You\u2019ve got a couple of masks, the high-performing masks, that are now coming up to the sort of anniversary date. They\u2019re a year old, and the gel mask has only been out there two years. Can you talk about the growth profile of those masks? And should we expect an annualization and a drop-off from those? ", "Peter Farrell", "Good question, Dan. That\u2019s one for Don. ", "Don Darkin", "Right now we\u2019re not seeing anything [unintelligible]. In fact most of our mask lines are increasing. We had a lot of mix shift in certain areas, but there\u2019s nothing changed on those products at this point. And they\u2019re actually trucking a little bit higher than we would have budgeted. ", "Peter Farrell", "I guess Dan to give it a bit more flavor, with the trilogy, the 4X products, we were getting hammered a bit in the nasal mask category, and whilst we\u2019ve always had the drop on everybody in the full face mask and on the pillows, we did see a drop-off in the nasal category and the Mirage FX has really turned that around. But apart from that, Don\u2019s right, it\u2019s always been encouraging, our mask products, the sales and we\u2019re happy as we\u2019ve ever been with the offerings.

Without wanting to labor the low-end CPAP point, but the business you walked away from, are you talking about a gaggle of smaller customers? Or medium size customers? Or larger customers? Where\u2019s the sort of price pressure come from? What type of customer?

", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah, look, we\u2019re not seeing any ogres out there in the marketplace. This always comes up. All the time people focus in on pricing. Let\u2019s talk about competitive bidding. That was on the last four or five calls, and in the markets where competitive bidding has been used, we have not seen any material difference in our business. And so price pressures will always be there, and hell, if I\u2019m a guy buying your products, I\u2019m always going to try something on you. Why not? But we generally have been pretty good about saying, look, here\u2019s where we\u2019ll go, and that\u2019s kind of it. And that happened in this quarter a little bit more than what we\u2019re used to, but we don\u2019t see a sign of this being something that\u2019s going to continue for the future. It might, but there\u2019s no real indication that it\u2019s going to continue. ", "Dan Hurren - UBS", "Yeah, I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s changed. You\u2019re right, you\u2019ve always been very up front about the constant price decline, the 5% price decline you\u2019ve seen. And it\u2019s always been there.

We are really delighted with the 58.8% gross margin, given what we thought it could be. Now, we can take that down quite easily and really drive the top line, but that\u2019s not the game we are in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. ", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Maybe if we could just switch topics. The buyback, Brett could you perhaps talk about what your plans are there? Because certainly as you said in the lead in comments, you\u2019re well ahead of the historic rate. ", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure. So on the buyback we have, we did refresh the buyback back in August with a 20 million share buyback program, so we\u2019re working through that. And we\u2019ve still got 18.1 million left there. So I wouldn\u2019t give specific guidance on it, but I think I\u2019d say we\u2019re likely to be more aggressive than we were the previous year in terms of the buyback. And the intention is we\u2019ll work through that authorized buyback. But timing at this stage, I don\u2019t think we can be too specific other than to say that we intend to work through that authorization. ", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "This recent quarter is our best guide to the rest of the year? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, we will buy quite a bit and then I think it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019ll definitely continue to buy back and we\u2019ll certainly buy back the absolute minimum, whatever gets diluted out of the employee comp issues for example, and equity issues. So we\u2019ll do that as a minimum and I think you can see that whilst it might not be 4 million shares a quarter, I certainly think we\u2019ll be buying back more aggressively. We probably averaged about a million per quarter last year and I think you can say I think we\u2019ll be more aggressive than that. ", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "And just switching to mask sales. I think there was a comment there along the way that mask sales are actually a little bit ahead of your expectations. When I look at device sales growth slowing down, is there any risk that as the install base of ResMed products, the growth rate slows, that that has a read across to the masks and the replenishment programs? ", "Peter Farrell", "If you look at the bigger picture, and you look at the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing and the various comorbidities, I would see any slowing in the growth as a reflection of the general economic malaise rather than anything to do with sleep disordered breathing. The prevalence in these areas, whether it\u2019s Type II diabetes at 80%, the real question is, and congestive heart failure at 80%, the real question is at what level of AHI apnea hypopnea index do you treat these patients. And as we look at the clinical data that are being developed, it\u2019s very clear that the earlier you treat, the better off you are. So we\u2019re in the prevention space, it\u2019s a great space to be. You save money. We\u2019re putting a lot of emphasis now on health economics in order for us to work with the payers and say look, if you invest in this up front you\u2019re going to save as you go forward. And the returns, the numbers we\u2019re looking at, you get a return within one calendar year. So we\u2019re in such a good space. So you know, it\u2019s easy to look at what\u2019s happening currently in the marketplace, but it\u2019s a blip, I think. This is a very healthy business. We\u2019re glad we\u2019re in it. And it will be interesting to see how the next couple of quarters unfold. I\u2019m not a soothsayer, but we feel reasonably confident where we are. We do.  ", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "I guess asking a related question, we\u2019ve seen mask growth in the U.S. up more than 20% over the last couple of years. And my presumption is that\u2019s on the back of replenishment programs, which has been a fantastic trend, and certainly well ahead of what we had anticipated. My caution is can that be maintained? Is the replenishment opportunity, is the mask per patient opportunity not being closer to being saturated now than it was, and therefore that growth rate at risk of coming back.", "Peter Farrell", "I\u2019ll just say a word about that, and then Don Darkin can come in if he feels like it. But when we\u2019ve looked at the number of masks that have been sold per patient per year, we are staggered at the potential to do more business. And in other words, when we\u2019ve looked at it it\u2019s been about 25% of the potential. So in other words, there\u2019s a fourfold possibility there just in the current space. Putting it more specifically, patients generally will be reimbursed for a mask every three months, or every four months, depending on who\u2019s paying. And the number of masks per patient per year is closer to one than four. So there\u2019s a lot of potential there. Do you have a more recent figure Don? ", "Don Darkin ", "No, we\u2019ve still got a ways to go, even to come close to a half. I think we\u2019re seeing these increase slowly as we put effort into this. We have our own teams now working on this in education way, both in the business and in patient usage, and we\u2019re seeing it move up slowly. And plenty to go. ", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "I\u2019m finding that hard to reconcile with the 7% growth that you\u2019re talking about. I mean, given that we\u2019ve seen 20% growth in masks\u2026 ", "Peter Farrell", "Oh no, we\u2019re talking new patients pretty much. ", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joshua Zable with WJB Capital ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "I know it\u2019s not your typical quarter, but that\u2019s what you guys get for spoiling us for so long I guess. ", "Peter Farrell", "Well, we\u2019re not unhappy with it Josh. ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "Good. Just a couple of housekeepings and then I sort of want to go back and just hash out one quick thing. So just a couple of housekeepings. First of all, Brett, on your assumptions of the Aussie dollar, I know it\u2019s had a crazy move around. It was at 110 when you gave guidance, just as far as you gave us your expectations for the year, kind of what you\u2019re assuming, because it\u2019s been all over the place. That\u2019s the first housekeeping question. ", "Brett Sandercock", "Are you asking me for a prediction on the currency? ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "No, no. I\u2019m just asking based on the sort of guidance you gave, what you\u2019re assuming for the Aussie dollar. ", "Brett Sandercock", "It was around the 102-103 mark for the Aussie against the U.S. ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "Okay great. And then just point of clarification, Peter. I know you talked about the ventilation business in the U.S. Just to be clear, so you have not sold anything in the U.S. yet. That will start sort of end of this year and then into calendar 2012?  Just for clarity. ", "Peter Farrell", "No, we haven\u2019t done material sales. We\u2019ve made sales to CareFusion, and the first few units have gone out. Geoff Neilson is sitting beside me, so maybe he can give you a little bit of flavor of what he expects or hopes for. ", "Geoff Neilson", "So we\u2019ve just done some initial stocking orders to CareFusion, and they\u2019ve started selling as of earlier this month to institutions. And Stellar 100 is also available to home care providers, but that\u2019s not material. That\u2019s just on a real niche to do with pediatrics or patients that need such a high [unintelligible] product in that segment. ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "And then just Peter, not to beat a dead horse here, I know obviously everybody\u2019s asking about the generator growth. Now that you have the benefit of hindsight of a couple of quarters, generator growth obviously hasn\u2019t been spectacular for the past few quarters. I know we\u2019ve talked about sort of the bi-level kind of being a hole in the product line. Now you\u2019re kind of talking about the low end pricing and walking away from deals, which I think we all appreciate and understand. And you\u2019re also sort of talking about how you don\u2019t expect it to continue going forward. Obviously your competitors have acted irrationally in the past. I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile, if I look past, has this been going on and now you\u2019ve kind of started to comp up against it, and so that gives you more confidence that you don\u2019t have it? Or I know this sort of happens at the end of the quarter, so it\u2019s difficult to predict, so while you might not be seeing it today, is there sort of something that gives you confidence that there was something going on there that made them aggressive at the end of this particular quarter that might not happen next quarter? I think everyone\u2019s trying to reconcile exactly what happened this quarter versus the past and maybe why it will be different going forward, or if we should account for that for the next couple of quarters until you sort of comp up against the lower end, you\u2019re going to struggle there. ", "Peter Farrell", "Well, I think the trends we can have some confidence in - we see the HST to AutoSet just continuing. And it looks like it\u2019s 100% year over year. Does that mean it\u2019s going to be 40% next year? It\u2019s the sort of thing that could really really take off. And the mechanics are, if you\u2019re doing HST, you\u2019re unlikely to be going to fixed CPAP, simply because you\u2019re not bringing the patient in to do a titration. So we\u2019re reasonably confident that the HST is going to go forward at a reasonably quick rate. We can\u2019t guarantee that, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. And the reason is if you put a patient through a sleep lab, it\u2019s inconvenient, it\u2019s ineffective, and it\u2019s expensive. And if you want to put a number to it, say $6,000, wait a couple of months, versus $2,000, get it done immediately. We also know that there\u2019s 30% attrition for patients that are given a script to go to a sleep lab because of the timeframe and the difficulty in certain parts of the country in getting onto the list. They say, the hell with it, and I\u2019ve got to get a kit bag and I\u2019ve got to go to the lab, etc. So the HST to AutoSet, because of its convenience, cost, and so forth, we see that continuing. Now, as for the sort of \u201ccrazy\u201d deals and so forth, we have seen this stuff before. It was just that toward the end of the quarter a couple of these deals came through and we talked about it and said, you know what? We ain\u2019t going to go there. And so that was it. I don\u2019t see this as a big deal. I think it\u2019s just something that\u2019s a try-on, something that happened, that\u2019s just the way the world is. I don\u2019t see it as a trend.  ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "Okay, and then just you mentioned HST, and this is my last one, I saw today that the president of the AASM sort of proposed new guidelines for out-of-center testing. I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d got a chance to look at that. ", "Peter Farrell", "No, I haven\u2019t seen that Josh.", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "Okay, just wondering if there was anything sort of changing there. I\u2019ll go back and bug you about it later.", "Peter Farrell", "By all means. Email, etc. But I haven\u2019t seen the AASM. But it\u2019s not a surprise. They\u2019ve understood that this is happening, and they want to be able to be in the catbird seat I guess, and they see themselves as the protector of the realm, and they would like to see that they are setting the standards. I assume that\u2019s it. It\u2019s going to be a big ask for them, unless everybody who diagnoses patients has to be a boarded sleep member, I think they\u2019re going to have trouble doing what they want to do. But I don\u2019t blame them. Certainly it\u2019s not unexpected. I knew it was in the hopper, but they were developing standards - they don\u2019t call it home sleep testing, they call it out-of-lab testing. I won\u2019t comment further on that.  ", "Joshua Zable - WJB Capital", "They\u2019re trying to rile you up, you know. ", "Peter Farrell", "And they\u2019re having some success. [Laughter]", "Operator", "I\u2019d like to thank our analysts today for participating in the question and answer portion of today\u2019s call. We are now at the one hour mark, so I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dr. Farrell for his final remarks. ", "Peter Farrell", "All right. Well, I think we\u2019ve had plenty of remarks. And I\u2019d like to thank everybody for being on the call and thank all the ResMed people for working so hard. And with that, I\u2019ll close the proceedings. Thanks all.

My name is Stacy and I will be your conference moderator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "In addition the company asks me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets of the company\u2019s products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed\u2019s SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company\u2019s website at www.resmed.com.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead sir.", "Peter Farrell", "Thanks Stacy, and thanks everyone for joining us. I\u2019ll begin as usual with a short summary and then pass the call over to Brett Sandercock, ResMed\u2019s CFO and then we\u2019ll go into a Q&A.", "So first, the financials. We finished with a very solid quarter. Global revenues in the second quarter of 2012 grew 9% to $333 million, which was also up 9% on a constant currency basis. Revenues in the Americas grew by an encouraging 12% to $182.5 million and ROW revenue increased by 5% at the headline and also in constant currency terms to $150.2 million.", "GAAP EPS increased 14% to $0.42 for the quarter and I believe consensus was $0.38 which we comfortably beat and if we exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.44which we would suggest represents effective management and operational excellence and efficiency.", "With the respect to product performance, masks continued to perform well across the globe and we continue to take market share. The three masks, new masks in the FX trilogy that is the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX as well as the four versions of these masks continue to do extremely well and with the success of the Mirage, we are gaining additional share in nasal masks category which recently had been a week spot for us.", "And we just launched the Swift FX [Bella] mask giving female patients the choice of how they wear the masks since it offers hair management solutions in brief and we expect this to also improve patient compliance and in brief the mask has a loop which wraps around the ears without any straps on the forehead or head itself.", "And as we recently been highlighting, there is a further reason we continue to see strong growth in the mask category other than the introduction of the new products is that there is excellent business in the resupply or replenishment of masks to the existing patient base. And in this context we are working with our DME and HME customers to help them leverage this business opportunity.", "Global growth in flow generators this quarter was primarily driven by ventilation and bilevel devices including significant contribution from our Adaptive Servo-Ventilation line, the VPAP Adapt and the S9 AutoSet CS, but in addition also the Stellar products. And we can provide more granularity on that if people wish. In the Americas, bilevels are regaining share as they prove to be a strong value proposition for HMEs and physicians who we believe are scripting them.", "Growth in the basic flow generator market is still somewhat problematic. It continues to be a challenging environment and actually proved to be a bit more so this quarter in Europe due to difficult macroeconomics or the macroeconomic environment there which people don\u2019t need very much explanation on.", "The European climate is a little bit cautious and perhaps nervous and the market has slowed somewhat, looking more like growth levels in the US, that is around the 6% to 8% mark. But because we don\u2019t have any material business in those countries or in the countries under severe distress, we\u2019re somewhat isolated from the potential basket cases if you like, the so called PIIGS.", "Ventilation sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow progressively in Europe and parts of Asia. The 150 Stellar was launched in Europe at the end of the calendar year and both products have received regulatory approval in Japan and will launched there soon.", "These vents will rollout progressively over the next few quarters. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPS which is an automated bilevel mode. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development and there will be more offerings in this space over time. Sales of Stellar 100 in the US are ramping to expectations with the CareFusion sales team. They\u2019re also now selling our masks along with the ventilators.", "The new Greundler humidification product, HumiCare D900 started controlled product launch in Germany and we\u2019re doing further CPLs a little later on in France and Sweden. We are also working on FDA approval and we have to launch the 900 in the US in early 2013 or if not before pending FDA approval.", "On the HST or the Home sleep testing front in the Americas, commercial payers continue to see toward HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attended PSG sleep test while encouraging the use of HST. At this point Aetna, United and Humana have pre-authorization initiatives from PSG to see patients to HST. In 2011 we estimate approximately 15% of all the test or all the sleep test where HST and we expect to see continuing adoption of HST during 2012.", "It\u2019s difficult to look into the crystal ball and know exactly what that growth will be. I think it is going to double others within ResMed a more conservative, but we will see what it turns out to be. To some extent, this takes the pressure of low level CPAPs because as people would understand with HST, there is no setting of pressure in the sleep lab which means that physician DMEs, HMEs have to point towards APAP or our autosetting devices.", "So that\u2019s all good from our point of view. On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep disorder breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize a study conducted recently in Spain with over a thousand women, just published in the annals of Internal Medicine demonstrated the severe obstructive sleep apnea was associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death in women and that adequate sleep as treatment has been shown to reduce that risk. Also in a recent study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry researchers have suggested that schizophrenic patients have an improved quality of life if their sleep disorders are treated.", "And finally in the area of occupational health and safety, advisors to the FMCSA the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration at a meeting last December recommended that the agency toughen up its approach to evaluation and treatment for sleep disorder breathing. The Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee and the Medical Review Board have formed a joint subcommittee charged with producing recommendations for an eventual rule that will set standards for sleep apnea screening, evaluation and treatment. They plan to present this strategy next April.", "Now let me turn the call over to Brett. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks Peter. I will just run through the Q2 results. Revenue for the December quarter was $332.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms revenue also increased 9%. Income from operations for the quarter was $67.3 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of unfavorable currency movements.", "Net income for the quarter was $62.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.42, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 59.7% up sequentially from Q1 FY12. On a sequential basis our gross margin benefited from favorable product mix, improvement in manufacturing and logistics costs. Sequentially currency movements had a minimal impact on our gross margin this quarter.", "Looking-forward for the balance of FY12, we expect to have gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product cost through supply chain efficiencies, product design, and manufacturing improvements.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $100.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 30.2% compared to the year ago figure of 29.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 30% for fiscal year 2012.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 21%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.3% compared to the year ago figure of 7.3%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline.", "As a result of previously announced acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.7 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.4 million.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 25.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 will also be in the vicinity of 24%.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail, overall sales in the Americas were $182.5 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $150.2 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, in the Americas, flow generator sales were $80.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $102 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our portfolio of masks and continued growth in accessories.", "For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $100.1 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, also an increase of 2%. Masks and other sales were $50.1 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 3% while masks and others increased by 16%.", "Cash flow from operations was a record $110.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.3 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $22.9 million.", "Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter we repurchased 4.1 million shares for the consideration of $110.5 million. For the first half of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 8.5 million shares for consideration of $235.2 million. The 8.5 million shares purchased year-to-date represents approximately 5.7% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of December, we had approximately 14 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.", "On January 25, we increased our syndicated bank credit facility from 300 million to 400 million, providing the group with additional funding flexibility. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were 497 million. At December 31, total assets stood at 2 billion and net equity was 1.6 billion.", "I\u2019ll now hand the call back to your operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Please proceed.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "So, Peter, can you talk a little bit more about two things please, for my question. First is international volumes with a kind of steady through the quarter or getting worse or you really  looking at maybe a more difficult environment than you saw in fourth quarter for the balance of fiscal \u201912 and then ended a balance of the year, and then second, on the product mix side, that was a pretty impressive performance on gross margin. Is that something that was unusual in terms of the mix this quarter because that gives us a pretty broad range for the year. So maybe talk to the mix and the dynamics there please?", "Peter Farrell", "Let me just address the gross margin first Benefit. Obviously getting close to 60% was pretty encouraging. But I think the main thing is and I will let Rob chime in here particularly regarding Europe and maybe for the first question back to Robert. You will note that we had really encouraging growth, as you know the Adaptive Servo-Ventilator products are now in the S9 box and we saw a very good growth there and of course there is also the Stellar and the new Bi-Levels in the S9 box. So higher margin products for sure and that is pretty encouraging. I think we are kind of delighted that we made 60% gross margin.", "With respect to what is happening in Europe, I mentioned in my remarks that we were relatively insulated from the Greece, Spain and so forth. We did have some relevant business in Italy and however that was the quite good and obviously the big ones of Germany and France,. The 5% figure down a little bit from perhaps what we have observed in previous quarters and there was nothing that came to me in terms of changes during the quarter.", "One thing we do know is that I think we mentioned this before we haven\u2019t but there was a 6% reduction in France in reimbursement and that kicked in and also there was a reduction in reimbursement in Germany for PSG. But that only affected the private market which is roughly a third of the markets. The two thirds being the government-based hospitals where there was no drop in reimbursement. But maybe, Rob you can add some more flavor, if you wish?", "Rob Douglas", "Sure. I think there is no evidence of hitting a cliff in Europe at all. We would say the market growth in Europe is probably slow more around where the US has been over the past few years. The uncertainty is not helping, but the business is traveling along quite nicely and that\u2019s pretty steady as you go.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "And I guess my follow-up would be, maybe Brett can you give us a sense on hedge gains; in the quarter it looks like the other line was a little bit bigger and where might that be over the balance of this year if rates stay where they are? Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock", "So, if you say that where hedge gains recorded; they are through other income in the P&L which was $8.5 million this quarter which is predominantly FX guidance there. That you will see from operating income really we were hurt by currency however we had pretty significant hedging gains this quarter really due to all the strengthening both against the US, but in particular against the Euro over there sort of quarter-to-quarter it was about a 9% increase; so its quite significant and marking those to market goals those hedging gains.", "If you look at all up for the quarter, the FX was positive on the EPS by about a penny, so it\u2019s pretty much a wash with those gains. Looking forward, if rates stay exactly where they are or where they were at the end of December then you would get more gains through other income, we\u2019re on the hedging because we do mark-to-market. But at the moment, they are even up a little from where they were so there will probably be some minor gains coming through, but it would be largely benign unless we get significant movements in currencies again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "So I guess just back to the commentary on gross margin. So Peter, do you think that the gross margin then is sustainable at closer to 60% or do you think if there is some reason that leaves you to believe that it could fallback down to more of the middle of that range this 58% to 60%?", "Peter Farrell", "Well Michael, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball to be able to laser beam you know on what gross margins going to be; as you realized it\u2019s a function of geographic mix and Europe was bad a bit relative to the US. That doesn\u2019t help; but on the other hand you know the higher margin products showed the biggest growth. If that continues we\u2019ll be you know the sales and the Bi-Levels in the adaptive servo-ventilator obviously master a pretty good and remain good and that\u2019s been true to the past several quarters.", "So assuming the mass hold up and assuming the growth holds up in the Bi-Levels, the vents and also the order setting products will be close up to 60; if that doesn\u2019t hold up we might drop a little bit, but I think Brett said you know we\u2019re comfortable with 59 to 60 and that\u2019s a better and as precise as we want to be.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "Can you give us any timing around new platform launches on the flow generator side; I guess S92 or S10?", "Peter Farrell", "We\u2019re working on those; I don\u2019t know; I\u2019ll throw that to Don Darkin. Normally, we don\u2019t, you know we\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re launching. So making predictions there is not what we\u2019re normally into, just like we don\u2019t make too many predictions.", "Don Darkin", "I do but most of the others don\u2019t.", "Peter Farrell", "Don, do you want to say anything?", "Don Darkin", "The platform is well underway, but at this point assume that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. You know particularly, the step-up in expenditure on R&D and that\u2019s obviously reflective of a greater push in certain areas. But just like we don\u2019t give guidance, we are not going to tell you when the product is going to launch.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "Yeah I mean, that actually read into my next question, just because we\u2019ve seen R&D even on a constant currency basis we\u2019ve seen some pretty dramatic increases there and I am just wondering kind of where you are spending all the money. I understand, look you are launching new products at a regular intervals etcetera, but the number of new products I guess from an outsider simply doesn\u2019t really seem like its gone up all that dramatically. But yet your R&D is going up a lot. Is there something related to that big study, the SERVE-HF study that you\u2019re running or something else going on there behind the scenes?", "Peter Farrell", "The SERVE-HF study is sort of a fixed spent. So there has been no acceleration in that. We\u2019re up to around 900 patients out of the total 1260 planned. So that hasn\u2019t been reflected in the increase. It\u2019s mostly ventilation products, that are cheap to produce and also we\u2019ve been making a push on the health informatics and those two areas are really the main geeks; really ventilation and health informatics.", "Brett Sandercock", "Just as we\u2019ll pay much that the recent acquisitions, BiancaMed, Gruendler etcetera where they\u2019ve got some nice products and so on. We\u2019re continuing our R&D efforts there as well. So that increases as well and that\u2019s effectively R&D that we\u2019ve acquired but that we certainly you know, very excited about and we\u2019re absolutely funding those as well.", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah, good point.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "And then just one more quick question, did I hear correctly that the currency impact on your EPS was positive a penny, positive $0.01 this quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "Correct. The bottom-line that would\u2019ve been 41, but it came in at 42. So, you know, not really immaterial.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Did you call up the Bella Mask, B-E-L-L-A as in Beautiful or the Twilight Movie?", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah, hi Bella.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, just checking. Peter, not that I want to move you along, but can you talk about CEO succession planning right now?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, I think, we sort of talked about that last, maybe it was last call, I can\u2019t recall. But we\u2019re using an outside recruiter because we like their template. But there is not, it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re rushing along. You know, I made some comment there about my hope in sort of rather, it wasn\u2019t bland; things are going well and we\u2019re going through a very sort of circumspect evaluation and we have got 3,500 roughly give or take employees. We think a few of those people are qualified to run the organization and we are just going through 360s if you like and looking at peoples\u2019 strengths and where they maybe need their improvement.", "We are using the outside recruiter to help us with that evaluation; we\u2019ve also have another consultant, McKinsey Partner and we\u2019ve worked with Clem Doherty; I don\u2019t want to give advertisement for Clem\u2019s like minded individual\u2019s consultancy, but he is a good guy and he knows us very, very well, we have been working with him since 2004 and he knows all the senior people. And so we\u2019ve got if you like a person who knows us really, really well and recruiters that are beginning to digging down, getting some granularity and we will get reports back from those guys over the next couple of months then we will look at those reports and we will decide where we go from there. But there is no even an announcement Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "I am sorry, may be it was in Australian newspapers or somebody picked up that Nick was in queue for this; my am I reading or am I remembering something wrong?", "Peter Farrell", "I think there was a women from I think it was Australian Financial Review which is one of, I don\u2019t know if there is anybody from the AFR on the line but, they indulge in gross exaggeration where there is always takeout of bids where you know somebody is taking us over and there is a big flurry that goes up into the marketplace and we get calls from bankers wanting to help us out with our settle.", "Again, that\u2019s just a beat up; there is nothing to that as I told you, we\u2019re going through a proper circumspect evaluation and we will make an announcement sometime in the future. I don't think it will be, it will not be the near future.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Alright on a more financial note, you have if I remember correctly, a $400 million cash on the balance sheet, you just expanded your credit agreement, what are we doing with all this cash.", "Peter Farrell", "Well, we as you saw Brett indicated that we've been doing a very aggressive buyback, 4.1 million shares for over a 110 million last quarter, the quarter before that I think if Brett can correct me, 125 million about the same number of shares, 4.5 million. We think that from what we can see we think the stock is incredibly undervalued. You can see with our current results we like this area. We continue to be excited about the future. We are in an area which is, it\u2019s preventative medicine, it improves patients\u2019 quality of life and also reduces healthcare costs.", "So we are in a, if you like a sweet spot regardless of what happens in the crazy world of sick care, also known as healthcare. So we are in a very good space and we believe that the best value at the moment, we increase the borrowing so we have the flexibility. There's another 14 million shares approved for buyback. We believe that the stock is cheap and we are putting our money where our mouth is.", "Regarding the balance sheet, our total debt including current and non current together is around $225 million and we have net cash of around $0.5 billion, but most of that's offshore. We are not going to bring it back here at the ridiculous tax rate sort of existing in this country and so we will however make investments leveraging the balance sheet in areas like we did or like we\u2019ve done with say BiancaMed and so. But we\u2019re making some private investments where we think we can, we\u2019re not trying to make money on equity plays, I mean you know invest $3 million and you get 10X and you get $30 million back and you put it on our balance sheet with net cash of nearly half a billion, it\u2019s kind of like so what.", "So we are doing this in the marketplace to put people in a direction which we think makes sense or we are investing in technology that we think in the future will make sense. So that\u2019s where we are putting out our resources, the buyback and minor investments in people that we think can choose straight and will help us expand the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord. Please proceed.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord", "Hi, Brett first question is for you. I am certainly not a foreign currency expert. I just wanted to see if I can get a little bit more granularity there because you did a nice job of giving us some color around the constant currency growth in both SG&A and R&D and saying that revenue and gross margins were not affected by currency. So just looking at the SG&A and R&D based on constant  currency growth using your percentage as, it looks like it added about a million and half bucks currency did to the cost. And then you said other income 8.5 million was predominately FX. So I am getting into a higher impact from currency just using what we\u2019ve heard so far in the call. So could you just help me out in getting me to understand a little bit better?", "Brett Sandercock", "The big one there would have been the (inaudible) impact year-on-year judgment, so as you know a lot of ware that we have is basically a quarterly lag with the cogs until we ultimately sell that inventory. So if you step back and look at that lag impact, the Aussie dollar actually appreciated quite a lot over that period and that\u2019s what hurt us through the margin. And year-on-year certainly was quite a big impact, it would have been probably a little over 200 basis points on the margin. That\u2019s where we are getting hurt at the operating income line. And of course we had offsetting hedges coming through this quarter which more than offset that. So we ended up with having that one penny benefit coming through.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord", "Okay, so kind of leads to my next question on gross margin, sort of what the constant currency gross margin would have been, you said initially that you saw minimal impact from FX, but now you are seeing, it seems like you had actually a significant impact. Are you saying pro forma, we are looking at margins, it would have been on last year\u2019s currency levels around 61.5%?", "Brett Sandercock", "That certainly would have been high. So two things on this, Jason, the first one is my comments were generally on sequential movements in the gross margin which people tend to focus on given how volatile currencies are and so on. So that\u2019s one aspect. The other aspect is the year-on-year margin which if you looked at it kind of down I think was 60.8% last year, 59.7% this quarter. So that\u2019s definitely come down and the big driver of that is basically currency on that. So if you basically, you strip that out on constant currency basis, it is suffice to say that margins would have been higher than they are, than they were last year even. Fortunately we are live in the world where it is kind of really volatile at the moment. So we get a lot of these movements happening. You can see the weaker euro even now is going to play a part as well and end up being a bit of a headwind for us. So, there is a whole bunch of factors playing it on that margin, making it pretty difficult to predict.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord", "Is it possible that you have the mirror reversed in the currency markets happen at some point in time?", "Brett Sandercock", "In terms of potentially weakening Aussie and so on.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord", "Yeah, and then you would have gross margins that show up in the 200 basis points lower and is a negative impact. Is that possible or do you feel like?", "Peter Farrell", "It could. If you look trending over the last two or three years, where the Aussie has been basically on the rise almost inevitably and remotely. If that turned around for some reason, then there is a lot of headwinds we\u2019ve had over the last two or three years would end up reversing and we would see the benefit of that. And it overly stems from the large part of our cost base is here in Australia. So denominated Aussie dollars.", "Jason Mills - Canaccord", "Okay, and Peter, on the product mix of flow versus mask, you have consistently proven your mask growth is sustainably strong, what can you do to couple overtime your flow generator growth with that strong mask growth, I presume you don\u2019t have any inclination of that coupling with mask growth coming down. So, I presume that you\u2019re gearing up for flow generators to come up and exist at a higher level, sort of similar to your mask. I am just wondering what sort of initiatives or plan strategy you have in place for that?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, the one possibility that we\u2019re looking at, given the replenishment area and given the growth in masks, as you pointed out, it\u2019s been strong, traditionally strong. We\u2019ve seen a weakening in the flow generator space and now with HST coming in, I have mentioned that the positive impact on APAP or our autosetting products and also the growth in application of the Adaptive Servo-ventilation.", "In the last call, I mentioned some of the good things that were happening in Japan where Adaptive Servo-ventilation was being used on heart failure patients even though they didn\u2019t have frank sleep disorder breathing. The cardiologists there and we are involved in a continuing study there. The cardiologists there believe that because of the impact on fluid in the lungs and fluid in the pleura that Adaptive Servo-ventilation should be used for all heart failure patients.", "That\u2019s pretty encouraging and we\u2019d like to see that spread, but one thing we are looking at and Don can talk to this if he wants to add some flavor to it, but the replenishment area is showing very, very encouraging growth and we have been saying to ourselves, Gee you know what, what about flow generators in that space.", "So it\u2019s a huge number of very old flow generators. It is kind of like the old Volvo ads. We have been driving this thing for years and years and years. Well guess what, horsepower has changed, acceleration has changed in the newer ones, wouldn\u2019t you like to buy a new one and hey why don\u2019t you trade in your old one.", "So we seen and quiet frequently patients that will come in with a flow generator and a CPAP device that is over ten years old. With hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours on it. Well Gee you know things like noise, impedance, the algorithms I mean everything has evolved and obviously we make pretty good products because they last a long time, but they have been significant improvements particularly in people that have, and we sort of suggest a lifetime of five years. So there's a lot of devices that are out there that are well over five years old and like I can\u2019t give you the numbers but its in the millions of devices that are out there, how many are older than five years, we can provide some estimates, that looks like half of them. So there's no reason why we could alert people to the fact that they might benefit from a newer device with better compliance and certainly we would think better quality of life. So that's something we are looking at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Prior with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I will just have a rather quick one in regards to the European mix of flow gen business. Can you talk about whether the European mix is similar to the US in terms of flow in CPAP orders that's been viable given that the current level in CPAP what you see in the future?", "Peter Farrell", "That's quite a different mix. Generally Europe is much more a higher mix on the CPAP. Typically the older sets are a lot stronger and the US has a model where patients who don't live well with the CPAP end up on a Bi-Level device and that's not immobile in most European countries. So the mix is very different.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then just one follow-up question, Peter you talked about obviously home sleep testing and we've still got this issue of PSG labs not yet participating in HST. When do you see that coming, is it now that we've got pre authorization that you will get that potential transferences of PSG labs participating in HST and ultimately what\u2019s the conservative argument, you mentioned that some in ResMed are more conservative than yourself, I am just curious if you can flush out and any other kind of things for us.", "Peter Farrell", "Okay. Matt let me take your last question there. You can say that I am optimistic but in looking at the terrain, I think we\u2019re going to see a doubling in HST, which means the potential doubling in the America\u2019s in AutoSetting setting devices. So that just my hunch. We\u2019re seeing there is some anecdotal evidence coming back from the marketplace that the payers are getting a little more AMC there, they are saying material expenditure on PSG and they are not -- this authorization is building up a whole ahead of steam. Why? Because it\u2019s going to save them money and you are looking at rough figures 1200 bucks plus for PSG versus 250 for HST. But they are other dynamics that are playing here as well and we\u2019re trying to inform the sleep labs and they\u2019ll pass it over and make in a second and need for him to make a comment.", "But the sleep labs, we did a survey and found out that 30% of patients have a script written to attend the sleep lab for PSG, 30% of the patients time show out. So if your 30% are no shows that\u2019s big number. And we\u2019ve also found that if the sleep lab also offers HST and if you think about HST versus PSG. PSG you get on a six to eight week wait list and you got to bring a duffle bag with all your gear and then they wire you up. And this is for something that a five-year-old child can diagnose. I mean this is something that is very, very simply to do, particularly if you have a history and a physical by a physician who knows what he or she is doing.", "So you could almost argue, you could go straight from a history and physical. In a lot of cases straight to autosetting treatment because only autosetting will tell you whether you need treatment or not. But that means obviously buying a device. But physicians would have been in this game for while, now 80% of the time which patient needs treatment and will benefit from it. Anyway stepping back from that so you have got labs. Now if they offer both, then it\u2019s a 2% no show which is quite different. Now, if you think of HST, it is a medium. You take the HST, the apnea link in our case home with you. You bring it back the next morning. In two minutes you get a full diagnosis and you immediately satisfied with the CPAP rather than waiting six to eight weeks, perhaps ten weeks before you\u2019re put on treatment.", "It\u2019s very inefficient to PSG. It\u2019s very expensive by comparison with HST and much, much, much more inconvenient. So you are going to see consumer move there, you are seeing the payers pushing people in that direction. And I think that the labs that don\u2019t offer HST are actually dinosaurs. The fact is that the whole market is moving in that direction. There is no stopping it and those that resisted. I can loose them. So, and I think given the fact that most of them don\u2019t want to end up on the dole or accepting welfare payments. I think they will move and how quickly that will happen, I am saying it\u2019s doubling. It could even get a higher. I don\u2019t think it is going to be any worse than 30% of all sleep testing and HST. Others conservatively within ResMed, the same more like 25%. But that\u2019s still pretty significant 80% growth versus 100%.", "Brett Sandercock", "But Matthew, to your question there about sleep labs are not participating in HST. They\u2019re actually already are. And they\u2019re participating at the double-digit percentage rate and it varies by geography around the Americas. But if you look in the Northeast and the Southeast particularly where there is very high density of sleep labs, you\u2019re talking 20% to 40% of them all ready sleep centers participating in home sleep testing and some of them actively offering it because they\u2019re saying that the no-show rate for just PSG is about 30% and the no-show rate when you offer both PSG and HST give people choice. Its down to 5%, could be in that 2% to 3% range in some early data. So that no-show rate goes way down. They\u2019re seeing that and the forward-looking sleep centers are already doing this. Even the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which is the sort of group that helps govern this group has put together an accreditation program for Home sleep testing. So, it\u2019s now sort of sanction within the sleep center community and they\u2019re all talking about how do we tie in to patient centered medical homes to accountable care organizations. And all this evolution of the payer environment within the US market and how do we make sure sleep changes upon utilization management at those payers to care management or disease management. So that we show that there is an ROI to the insurance company of diagnosing and treating and managing the patients on CPAP, APAP and VPAP products. So that message is there and both across sleep centers and across the sleep medical communities as well as the HMEs and manufacturers like ResMed, we\u2019re partnering up to put that story together and drive home sleep testing as part of that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Clair with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Any comments you can give us on the launch of Stellar 100 and then Peter you mentioned we have some more ventilation products in the pipeline. How should we think about ventilation going forward for you guys?", "Peter Farrell", "I think Jeff Nelson, if he is still awake, he is in Europe and Geoff you are the guy on the ground there. Stellar has been released in Europe as a 100 mm on 50 would you like to comment on that please Jeff?", "Geoff Neilson", "Can you hear me?", "Peter Farrell", "I can hear.", "Geoff Neilson", "Okay so Stellar 150 has been in the market now for a while. It\u2019s launched throughout Europe and we have also got that with CareFusion distributing into hospitals in US and they have launched that towards the end of last quarter. And Stellar 150 we launched in Europe and that has our automatic therapy called IPAP switches being well received so far.", "And Stellar 100 and 150 are approved in Japan and we look forward to launching that in the next quarter and the growth rate is to our expectation and CareFusion has been lot of sampling and their sales force is excited and we are getting some interest from the hospitals and they are showing that, but obviously the sales cycle in the hospital is a bit longer than at home care.", "And that is story with the Stellar 100 and 150 and looking forward we are investing in new platforms to replace our existing platforms that are available in Europe and the timing of that we wouldn't say at the moment, but we are actively investing in that and you can see that by some of our R&D expenditure.", "And then we are also looking at humidification with Gruendler and we are doing a CPL or controlled product launch in Europe at the moment and we would be looking forward to launching their new humidifier over in about a quarter\u2019s time and before the end of the financial year.", "So we are excited about what we are doing and the business is growing; it\u2019s growing quickly in the US with some of the HST products and obviously we are looking forward to new products as they come online.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Then a quick one here for Brett, you know how should we think about the medical device tax impact in 2013?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, I mean it\u2019s probably going to be interesting one for all medical companies there on that tax that comes through. At the moment, I mean we have a, we got a team together at the moment that's looking at it on the assumption that its going to come through and who knows what might happen. But at the moment, with sort of planning that\u2019s going to come through, what \u2013 that Peter and guys might have some color on whether it gets there or not, but at least that\u2019s what we are planning for. And then it\u2019s just a question of who is, how you do that, who you pace with, or who does that kind of thing, I think all that's got to be worked through.", "Peter Farrell", "I mean, we are expecting the worst on that, but hoping for the best, I mean there is a lot of water to flow under the bridge David, and hopefully it ends up being positive for the whole of the medical device industry.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Hurren with UBS. Please proceed.", "Dan Hurren - UBS", "Well, good morning everyone. Just wanted to ask Peter your comments at the last quarterly result in relation to stopping discounts for the low end CPAPs in the US became such as huge issue after the quarter. Could you just give an update on that?", "Peter Farrell", "I never mentioned it Dan, if I had known it was going to create such havoc.", "Dan Hurren - UBS", "Well, Peter could you perhaps just, I mean at the time you\u2019re talking about some of that volume might come back would have fallen in the next quarter; you didn\u2019t know how many of the price sensitive or how many of the buys were price sensitive; can you just talk about how that\u2019s played out over the second quarter?", "Peter Farrell", "Well, I think you know I was talking about that we were doing a bit of market segmentation etcetera, but look I am going to tell that to make my comment, but basically we had a period where there was a sort of hockey stick thing going on when I mean I am going back a few years now, we decided that we wanted to have a more you know saying in a way of satisfying customers more of you know; if you can get to further, further, further, I mean that\u2019s kind of dreaming a little bit, but you don\u2019t want to have 60% of your sales in the last month.", "I am just trying to pulling that figure out of the air; I am not saying that that\u2019s a real number. But too much of the business was being pushed towards the end of the quarter. And it creates logistical issues and if you start offering better prices you know appearing as you are desperate at the end of the quarter to make sales. Then that\u2019s going to push everything in the direction of a hockey stick at the end of the quarter and we decided that we did want to, we did want to offer bag and base process and we didn\u2019t want to have this logistical nightmare towards at the end of the quarter and we\u2019ve taken steps to get around it, so Mick, why don\u2019t you, do you have anything to add to that?", "Michael Farrell", "Well, I mean the only thing I would say that Dan is that, we haven\u2019t changed really anything in how we operate from Q1 to Q2. We operate our business for the long term, looking at long term efficiency and supply chain management for us; our manufacturing facilities, our inventory facilities and for our customer\u2019s inventory facilities and delivery to their patients.", "What changed from Q1 where we were minus 2% in America\u2019s flow generators to Q2 where we were plus 4% in America\u2019s flow generators wasn\u2019t any fundamental shift and how we did that. We are doing the same thing as we did in Q1 and Q2. What happened was that we have seen a positive impact overtime going out talking to sleep physician by sleep physician, sleep lab by sleep lab, HME by HME, about the benefits of the S9 Bi-Levels to benefits of the VPAP adapt which is now in the S9 platform, the benefit of the VPAP ST and driving the value of those products and leveraging the positive mix shift from S9 Skype up to S9 auto-setting that is linked with HST which is titled to the question.", "So that is probably mix-shifts have resulted in that six point turnaround from minus two to plus four. It\u2019s nothing to do with any sort of change in long-term. By the way we got the same of operational efficiency in tying with our large customers that we have before and we plan to stick with that going forward.", "Dan Hurren - UBS", "So I just, I guess in a word, you are saying that the segmentation is progressing as planned and is proven to be successful?", "Michael Farrell", "Correct. We are doing the Wayne Gretzky skate to where the tuck will be, not where it was and that\u2019s what we have been doing and it seemed to work here in Q2 and we plan to continue to do that.", "Peter Farrell", "Have you understand the Wayne Gretzky?", "Michael Farrell", "All the rugby ball\u2026", "Peter Farrell", "Yeah, where do you think the ball is going to end up basically; if you\u2019re not an ice hockey fan, than we can send you a bit more detail, but we\u2019ll take it offline.", "Dan Hurren - UBS", "I will check it out on YouTube. Thank you, gents.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Low with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "If we could just turn back to the same sort of topics, the Stella sales during the period, I mean, Mick you just commented that you had to turnaround the 6% turnaround. Just how much was ventilation sales contributed to that?", "Brett Sandercock", "Well, we don\u2019t give granularity on that, David. You know, because once you start, it\u2019s going to be every quarter getting down to granularity and we don\u2019t think makes a heck a lot of sense. I think Geoff put it correctly we were very satisfied with where we are in the sales, both with CareFusion and with our Asia-Pac and European sales. So a good growth and we expect to see that continue.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "And just again on the Bi-Levels and I guess that was an issue going back a few quarters. If you could talk, I mean, Mick you mentioned the marketing of those products and then now in the S9 platform, just can you talk about where sales of Bi-Level devices are now. This is where they were in 12 months ago, given we went through that deep with the product launch?", "Michael Farrell", "No, David. We\u2019re not going to go, like we\u2019re not going to split out the category between details of VPAP ST versus Stella. We\u2019re not going to go in to the detail split between CPAP, APAP and Bi-Level, other than to say that it was positive material impact of the S9 Bi-Levels, particularly of VPAP adapt and the ST, which is now there sort of high margin, high value for the customer, high value for the insurance provider products and we\u2019re focusing our attention, and marketing and our sales people have their feet on the street with selling the value proposition of ResMed\u2019s high end flow generators and ventilators as well as our algorithm and how essential as part of HST so a combination of many factors have contributed to that sort of positive mix shift that you saw in flow generators in that period.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Sure. Look I am not expecting you to break it out, I just wanted to get a sense as to whether we were sort of back to the same run rate or whether the Bi-Levels is a category offering the same opportunity that they were 12 or 24 months ago?", "Michael Farrell", "Look I think we have a good opportunity to take share overtime in the Bi-Level category and in the ventilation category and Geoff can talk more about the global ventilation opportunity, but within the Americas in Bi-Levels we got a lot of run rate and we are going to move at it and keep the value proposition selling on a ongoing basis.", "Geoff Neilson", "And having said that I think last quarter and certainly the quarter before we talked about the non-complaint OSA so if you like the lower margin Bi-Levels VS products we are seeing that the S9 order set has such a good algorithm, you know one sleep physician who is switched exclusively using the S9 order set and he said he has gone from the low 20s in terms of non-complaint OSA going on to Bi-Level down to more like 5%. So that\u2019s at the low end and we don\u2019t see any big changes there; in other words it\u2019s going to go from the 20% down to perhaps the 5% non-complaint OSA going on to Bi-Level S.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "And just one follow up, the pricing environment I guess it\u2019s a pretty standard question on these quarterly calls, but could you talk about what you've seen with your ASP and perhaps touch on what the competitive environment been as well?", "Geoff Neilson", "You know we happily we've seen no unexpected, put it that way, unexpected changes in ASP which is a good thing. But it seems that the other guys are you know not doing anything silly and we certainly have no plans to do anything silly. I mean typically we are not price setup and we intend to keep that philosophy going forward, and I don\u2019t normally comment on that it\u2019s the environment wasn\u2019t particularly surprising.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "The 3% to 5% price decline to the quarter that you've talked about in the past\u2026", "Geoff Neilson", "Well, that's annualized. That's an annualized figure, the 3% to 5%.", "Operator", "We are now at the hour mark. So I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.", "Peter Farrell", "Alright. Well, thanks once again for joining us today and I\u2019ll just reiterate that we continue to be excited about the future prospects for us in the sleep disorder breathing space. We\u2019re in the right space. Its preventive, improves quality of life and also reduces healthcare costs and we look forward to continuing contributions in this space.

My name is Angela, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "The company has asked me to read -- address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as: Projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. ", "These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as forms 10-Q and 10-K, which may be accessed through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO. Dr. Farrell, please go ahead, sir.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Thank you, Angela, and I think we still have some time left. And thanks, everyone for joining us. I'll begin with some summary remarks, and then turn the call over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO. And Brett will provide more granularity on the numbers. And then we'll go to Q&A. So first, the financials. A short summary. We finished with a very solid quarter. Global revenues were $349.1 million, up 11% headline growth or 13% constant currency. Revenues in the Americas grew by an extremely robust 18% year-over-year to $189.9 million and ROW revenue increased by 4% headline or 7% in constant currency to $159.2 million. This represents the 69th consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line that is quarter-over-quarter since we went public in 1995. And obviously we're pleased with that result and will be able to continue that record growth. Net profit after tax increased 21% to $64.6 million while GAAP EPS increased by robust 29% to $0.44 for the quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.46. ", "With respect to product performance, let me first start with masks, this category continued to perform extremely well especially in the Americas. The 3 new masks in the FX trilogy, the Quattro FX, the Mirage FX and the Swift FX, as well as the for her versions of these masks continued to enjoy brisk sales. In fact, the Mirage FX is doing particularly well and we are steadily gaining additional share in this category. In fact, our data show that the Mirage FX is currently the biggest selling nasal mask on a global basis. And the new Swift FX Bella, mask for female patients, with loops that wrap around the ears, and this allows us to not have additional headgear, that is also doing very well and we expect to see continuing traction with it. ", "As we've been highlighting in the last few quarters, another big reason we continue to see strong growth in the Mask category, other than the continued introduction of outstanding products, is that there is excellent business in the resupply replenishment to the existing patient base. Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by our high-end devices, which are now all on the S9 device platform. Strong sales reflect the benefits of having these products configured on the small but more appealing S9 platform. In the Americas, the S9 VPAP bilevel range is also regaining market share because of its excellent quality algorithms and also the performance that we get with those algorithms. The bilevels are providing strong value proposition for both HMEs and positions. Growth in the basic Flow Generator segment is still problematic and, partially, this is driven by the positive mix shift to APAP or our AutoSet from basic CPAP. And this is primarily due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing. Europe continues to be challenging due to difficult macroeconomic environment there. Although sales were relatively  strong in Germany and the U.K. Although the European economic climate remains somewhat muted bilevels, AutoSets and Stellar Stellar products all continue to do well. ", "We also just announced the release of our new patient compliance management solution called EasyCare Online. This innovative new tool used by sleep labs home medical equipment and DMEs and other healthcare providers aggregates usage and efficacy data from sleep-disordered breathing, obviously patient's on CPAP therapy, with simply a single click. Simple to use while saving time and money. The EasyCare Online employs a secure cloud-based system that provides compliance data that can differentiate our customers and is critical in today's environment. ", "The S9 Flow Generators, our FX mask series plus now the new EasyCare Online bring superior compliance in patient management for quick and easy access to patient data in one centralized cloud-based location, unlimited providers can be associated with each patient to ensure the best possible therapy. We are quite excited about EasyCare Online. ", "Ventilation sales of the Stellar 100 and the 150 continue to grow, particularly in Europe and Asia. We launched the Stellar 150 in Europe at the end of the calendar year and we are seeing incremental acceptance. These ventilator products will roll out progressively over the next few quarters. Of note, the Stellar 150 includes iVAPs, our new automatic bilevel mode. The success of the Stellar is another positive indication of our continued progress in product development. We also have further plans for ventilation. ", "The new Grundler humidification about the HumiCare D900, is in a controlled product launch in Europe and going well. And we are working on FDA's submission to launch the 900 in the U.S. in fiscal 2013. This product will initially launch in the homecare setting which of course is our strength but also are planning to do a hospital lunch. ", "On the HST, home sleep testing front in the Americas, commercial payers continues to steer patients towards HST with the requirement of prior authorization for attended PSG test, or polysomnography, and they are encouraging the use of HST as the first line of diagnosis. Currently, Aetna, United and Humana have pre-authorization initiatives for PSG to steer patience towards HST. We expect this to continue. ", "In 2011, we estimate 15-plus-percent of all test for HST could even be as high as 20%. We expect to see a continuing adoption of HST during 2012 and onwards. My guess, in this area, is that it will increase another 100% this year. ", "On the clinical front, the flow of data substantiating the connection between sleep disorder, breathing and chronic diseases continues to materialize. For example, a new study in the April issue of Pediatrics by Bonuck et al from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, show that early life sleep disorder breathing in children had a strong persistent statistical correlation to serious behavioral and social-emotional difficulties. And by the time the children reach 4 years old, 40 to 100 -- by the time they reach 4 years old, excuse me. And by the time that they're at  age 7, the prevalence of these behavioral and emotional difficulties was between 40% to 100%. The study published also in circulation, Heart Failure by [indiscernible] from the University of Birmingham, showed that moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea can cause changes in the heart shape and function, that is increased mass, thickening of the heart wall and reduced pumping ability. The new study used to better define and control patient group in newer 3D echocardiograms. ", "And then New York University reported results of the study that showed simply using BMI misses nearly 40% of sleep disorder breathing in obese patients. And as much as 50% of sleep disorder prevalence in women. Obviously, this is something that suggest that BMI is not what it's touted to be and the people probably ought to be having sleep tests as a standard of care in just about all patients. We expect that, that will come in the future. ", "And as a brief update, our own clinical study which is the SERVE-HF on the use of adaptive servo-ventilation to treat chronic heart failure patients or sleep disorder breathing in chronic heart failure patients, we now have 1,000 patients currently enrolled. ", "A quick update, before I pass over to Brett, our management changes. Karen Borg has been appointed as President of Asia Pacific and that was in January of this year. Her career prior to joining ResMed had commercial diversity covering strategic and global marketing, M&A, sales and general management. And during the past 20 years, Karen has worked in Australia, the U.K., Russia, Taiwan and the U.S.A. And more recently, since 2003, she was in the leadership roles with Johnson & Johnson and both Australia and the U.S. Anne Reiser has been appointed President, Europe, and that was in March of this year. Anne has previously served as ResMed's Chief Operating Officer in France since 2007. Anne has demonstrated a great track record in building and leading our successful French organization with both strong sales growth and market share increases. Prior to joining ResMed and worked in various European companies for such companies as Zimmer, American Home Products, Hollister and the most recent  one was Medtronic. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Brett to provide some additional granularity on the financials, then we'll take any questions. Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Right. Thanks, Peter. Revenue for the March quarter was $349.1 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Income from operations for the quarter was $76.5 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $64.6 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, an increase of 29% over the prior year quarter.", "Gross margin for the March quarter was 60.3%, up sequentially from Q2 FY '12. On a sequential basis, our gross margin continue to benefit from favorable product mix and, to a lesser extent, favorable currency movements. Looking forward to the balance of fiscal year 2012, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 59% to 61%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at reducing product costs through supply chain efficiencies, product design and manufacturing improvements.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%.  SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 29.5%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 29% for the balance of fiscal year 2012.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.4 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 18%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1%, compared to the year ago figure of 7.4%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2012, reflecting the strong Australian dollar and continued investment in our product pipeline.", "As a result of previously announced acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangibles increased to $3.6 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $7.9 million. We also donated $1 million to the ResMed Foundation this quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.9%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail.  Overall sales in the Americas were $189.9 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $159.2 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 7% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking up revenue between product segments.  In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $78.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $111.3 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter underpinned by strong contributions from our nasal mask segment and continued growth in accessories. ", "For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $105.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%. Masks and other sales were $53.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, Flow Generators sales increased by 10% while Masks and other increased by 16%. ", "Cash flow from operations was $86 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $9.9 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $20 million.", "Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares, a consideration of $67 million. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we have repurchased 10.8 million shares, a consideration of $302.2 million. The 10.8 million shares purchased year-to-date represents approximately 7.3% of our diluted shares outstanding. At the end of March, we had approximately 11.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $540 million. And of 31 March, total assets was the $2.1 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion. ", "I will now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Let's see if we could start with the bilevel result. I mean, I'm trying to get a sense of whether after the difficulty you had a year ago, whether you think sales are back to normal? Or whether you think that will remain a driver for the next quarter or so?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, as you were aware, David, in the old S8 box, in fact, the adaptive servo-ventilator, the ACS products were in the S7 box, which is really outdated. So I think the switch to having the bilevels and all the auto setting products including the ASV products in the S9 platform, as I said, has just really attracted people. Now whether we're back to, you can always do better, we were very encouraged, obviously, by the fact that people did gravitate back to our bilevel products. I mean the algorithms were all pretty solid. Maybe I'll ask Geoff to comment on that but I -- and Don maybe, but I think we still got some more, we got some more runway ahead of us with bilevels. We'd like the whole market, but that's a bit unrealistic. But we're very satisfied with where we are. You want to add anything?", "Unknown Executive", "I think there's a bit of runway way ahead of us as well. But we're quite happy with where we are at the moment.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It's really important whether the dollars are sort of empowered where they were prior to the decline?", "Peter C. Farrell", "You mean in terms of percentages?", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Well, percentages or dollars. Just to add [indiscernible] or whether 75% back.", "Peter C. Farrell", "We'd be just giving qualitative -- we don't get to that sort of granularity, David. As I said, let's leave it. We still have some runway to go.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. The other topic I wanted to touch on was the rest of world sales. We've now seen, for a few quarters this year, we've seen sales great in a bit of a single-digit. I'm just wondering, if you could comment on what you've seen. I'm sort of particularly interested in breaking between European sales and what you saw and Asia Pacific region?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, as we've always said, the Asia Pac area tends to be a bit lumpy. We saw actually quite encouraging growth in India and China but obviously that's from a small base. The big markets there are Australia and Japan, and Japan tends to be extremely lumpy and you see these swings in the quarter but you're only looking at to say in the vicinity of 10% -- 9%, 10% of our total revenues in Asia Pac. Europe as we said on the last call, and as we still believe, the market there is 6% to 8% looking at their constant currency growth that's exactly where it was right bang and smack in the middle, 7%. I had mentioned that Germany was encouraging and that the U.K. was encouraging. France was less encouraging and the reason is this is still, if you like the post headache from the reimbursement changes in last October, where there was a 6% reduction. We see France coming back into the fold and that was probably the major reason given that our biggest market, obviously, is the Americas, which is around 54% and then you've got the next 2 biggest markets are Germany and France. So a little bit of weakness in either of those is obviously going to impact the numbers. But I think actually, we were reasonably encouraged with the European figures, given that there is a bit of a -- as you know, a malaise in the world economy.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I wanted to just follow up -- a question for you and maybe a question for Brett, if I may. For you Peter, talk about your view on the durability of the mix dynamics? And I get the sense that a major contributor to your revenue growth but also supporting unit growth, particularly, the overall growth number. And how many quarters or years do you think we have as a tail from bilevel and a conversion to auto?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, it's sort of a gradual thing, Ben, although we're seeing an acceleration of AutoSets and that is driven, we think, primarily, by the HST push. And there's a lot of runway there if you like. And basically, what were talking about here is that it's faster, better and cheaper if you like. And I think the insurers are now tweaking to that fact. The sleep labs will continue in their role, I mean, there are 90 different sleep disorders but one of them shouldn't be plugging up the labs, particularly, since a 5-year-old child -- recently some 5-year-old child would be able to diagnose the disorder breathing given the HST products that are around, not just ours. And the patient that's given the HST device immediately goes home that night and within a day or so is on treatment, whereas with the sleep lab you've obviously you've got the delay, you've got to wait until you can get into the labs and it might be a couple of weeks up to a couple of months. And what we've seen is that our data have shown that -- all data that we've paid to collect have shown that roughly 30% of patients who have been given a script to go to a sleep lab don't show up. Whereas if the sleep lab offers both HST and PSG, it tends to be more like 2%. So it's even in the interest of sleep labs to offer HST independently the fact that the Aetnas and Uniteds and Humanas and so forth are now requesting pre-authorization. So it's kind of a long way to answer your question but we see that continuing, I said I think it'll be probably up -- it could be something like this time next year, something like 40% of all tests. And all going well, if we had our wishes it would be cardiologists, endocrinologists and anesthesiologists all doing sleep tests and referring only the tough ones to sleep labs or sleep physicians. I think we see that happening. It may not be the cardiologists and endocrinologists themselves doing it but maybe the nurses or nurse practitioners and it's certainly much better for the patients and given the prevalence in those spaces, that is in Type 2 diabetes and cardiology in general. In fact, I've heard from a cardiologist the other day that he said that 40% of his patients have sleep disorder breathing and I figured, the figure that we use is about 50% and these aren't patients with heart failure, these are just the regular patients with A-fib or whatever else is wrong with their heart.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Sure. And so I guess, Peter, coming back and that's a helpful description, but coming back to the durability on that mix dynamic, it sounds like it's not 4 quarters, this is in your mind  2 or 3 years plus. So that helps offset the weakness you're seeing obviously in the low-end as well as give you much better pricing power versus trying to compete at that low end against whatever else is going on out there. Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, I think that's a fair assessment. We see continual weakness in the low end. And as HST kicks in, you don't have the option of going to the sleep lab, so you would actually have to go to an APAP, [indiscernible] and AutoSet. And we see that continuing to happen. That doesn't mean -- I mean sleep labs are not going to go away, but you're right it's not -- this is not 2 or 3 quarters, this is 2 or 3 years of the switch occurring. But it might happen more quickly, I mean, maybe that people just tweak to it and say, \"You know what? We're going to push this.\" And it's not as though -- I mean for the IDTFs, for example, I mean, they're getting something like $20 for doing oxygen tests, I mean, the oxygen level of the patient, SpO2, and they get $200 to $250 for a sleep test. I mean that's pretty -- it's pretty attractive to the independent testing facilities.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then perhaps for you, you gave us a little bit of a directional help on gross margin, the effect of currency, can you kind of walk us through the P&L and how currency affected your top through the earnings and give us a sense of what was in the other line this quarter, because I know it does move a lot of fair bit. And then I just wanted -- I was hoping that you could give us where you think the effective share count will be for the fourth quarter?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. In terms of the overall P&L, on the top line year-on-year the impact on currency was around $4 million negative. If you work through all the currency through to the bottom line, it was an adverse impact of $0.02 for us this quarter, so that was on the currency front. On the share front, the weighted average share, I think, where we finished the quarter was probably around 146.5 probably a number that the south of that would be probably where we estimate Q4 at.", "Operator", "And gentlemen your next question will come from the line of Matthew Prior of Merrill Lynch.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a two-part question. Just, Peter, if I could, can I just check the U.S. industry growth rate is still that  6% to 8% that you've been talking the last couple of quarters. I know you mentioned that in the year but you just checking it with the U.S. and just in terms of the whole home sleep testing contribution to the industry growth and the doubling comment that you made. Are you saying that these sleep labs, traditional PSG guys, getting involved in the HST game at all?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Your first question, Matt, on the growth, we still think it's 6% to 8%. We're obviously extraordinary happy with the growth in the U.S. I mean 18% is not something that we would've predicted but we were coming off fairly weak comparables from Q3 of 2011. So that certainly explains a lot of the growth there. So 6% to 8%, yes, that's what we're still using as the expected growth in the U.S. market. As far as sleep labs are concerned, yes, we are seeing more adoption of HST and it's hard to know how fast that will go. I mean, if you're the sleep lab and you're getting $1,200, give or take, for a PSG versus $250, say, for the HST, obviously, there's an incentive financially to do as much of the PSG stuff as you can, but there will be continual pressures there, and I think if the lab realizes that they're actually missing out on patients because of the inconvenience. I mean, patients have to bring a duffel bag in, stay overnight and get all wired up,  et cetera,  et cetera, and generally  it's a few weeks before you can get into the lab and so on and so forth. And I think that there will be more and more of the labs adapting HST, at least offering one or the other. And how quickly that -- like anything, conservative labs who think it's bad practice or they just want to get involved then other labs who are more entrepreneurial. So you see the writing on the wall and it is on the wall. They will be the early adopters, the entrepreneurial ones. So we see that continuing.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So it doesn't sound, Peter, as if it's a main contributor to that 15% or even 20% in some cases, you think that the PSG guys are really yet to weigh in to this, which could be another factor to HST takeup ...", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I'll throw that to Mick, he's the president of Americas, but what would you say to that?", "Michael J. Farrell", "I'd say that 25% to 30% of sleep labs are actually now experimenting in home sleep testing. So of that trailing 12 months, where we're looking at 15% to 20% of the tests being home sleep test, a large portion of that will be the IDTFs and the entrepreneurial home sleep testing companies that are out there. But a growing portion of that is sleep labs that are starting to recognize, not only as we talk about that it can reduce the leakage rate when you offer the choice of home sleep testing versus PSG. But also that sleep labs are realizing that just under 20% of the covered lives in this country, now have pre-authorization requirements for PSG. And that is up from 15% just 90 days ago. So they're watching this trend and they're saying, I want to get involved in this and get ahead of this curve, so that I can appropriately and properly treat my patients. So they're definitely getting involved. But to your point, Matt, I do think there's runway ahead as they get more involved over the coming quarters and fiscal years.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. My second question was just in regards to round one of competitive bidding. We hear a lot of anecdotes around the impact of round one, not so much in terms of obviously the price reduction in the 34%, but more in regards to the slowdown in volumes that have occurred in those 9 MSAs. Can you just talk to whether or not you've seen that or give us any kind of anecdotals around the impact in round one on volumes?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. So, Matt, it's a great question. So we're running a real-time experiment in those 9 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, those 9 MSAs. And we're just entering the fourth quarter of running and were able to compare the 3 quarters that we've seen of the 3-quarter  [indiscernible] in those 9 cities and we found that the growth rates within those 9 MSAs that we're into round one are equivalent to the general market growth rates across the U.S. market. So we have not seen a slowdown in revenue. We did see sort of split of 2 categories of customers within those, where you have the winners and the losers. The winners within those 9 cities, clearly, grew at a much faster rate and the losers started to decline in their purchases from us, which is logical. But the total volume, when you look at the mix between the winners and losers was a consistent revenue story. What you also saw is some of the winners were more sophisticated customers with larger economies of scale, larger abilities to go after install patient base and to market and sell replenishment programs to get patients who maybe, who are not as adherent and compliant to their device and regular use of masks and filters and tubing on a regular base. So you know, all in all, in those 9 cities, it's been a wash with some winners and some losers but we see good potential in partnering with the types of companies that have been winning in those areas.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, your next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "One of my questions have been answered. Your long-term debt increased in the quarter, is that associated with share repurchases?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Primarily, yes. Brett, you do want to...", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, that's exactly what I was going to say, Peter, yes. It will pretty much will be associated with the buyback, yes.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. CareFusion, how are they doing in the hospital environment which your new ventilator products?", "Peter C. Farrell", "It's still early on and the sales, obviously, selling to the hospital is a longer sales cycle. They're pitching the product to hospital customers and we're seeing some interest. They have a pipeline of interest that we've been reviewing with them but it's still too early to say.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The conversation that we've been having about home sleep testing, is it the -- the shift appears to be not that is bringing more people into the pool but that it's a shift from Mr. Jones doesn't go to the lab, he goes into the home. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, I think so. It's too early to draw any other conclusions I think. However, I think we're going to see, as the word gets out to the primary care physicians and so forth, what we've seen over the years is if you go back, let's say 5 or more years, PCPs in general were bamboozled by sleep disorder breathing, they virtually weren't looking for it. Now they're aware of it and the big -- they're ignorant of the existence of it. Now the ignorance tends to be more along the lines of the signs and symptoms, like they didn't think of referring patients for sleep test as often as they should but some of that resistance, we believe, and we need more data on this, we believe is, \"Oh my God, if I send a patient to write a script for a sleep lab, it's going to be 1 to 2 months. And then, it's just I know they won't do it or blah, blah, blah. If they, themselves, either get involved in HST, which they easily can, and were trying to work out some strategies, whereby we make it easy for them to do this or hook them up with IDTFs or VirtuOx or IDS or Midmark or one of the others. But without -- I think we'll see some movement there and we'll see a pick up in, I think, diagnosis the use of HST beyond the sleep people themselves. And that will...", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Is there an economic benefit to you of the home sleep testing? And can we quantify that?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, yes. I mean, the economic benefit is that the patients have to go on to an auto-setting device and that we get an uptick in revenue for that reason. In other words, you don't have the option of going to -- you don't do HST and then send the patient to a sleep lab to have the device pressure set. And the fact is, that there is now a substantial amount of literature showing that, in fact, if anything compliance is better with auto-setting products. It's certainly no worse, we can say that. And there are data that's coming from Europe, from Canada and from the U.S. which supports that. So I don't think physicians now are concerned about a compliance issue and, of course, it benefits us with a slight uptick in revenues.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "My final question is a lot of companies had an extra selling day in the month of February and they've been able to quantify the impact to revenue. Did you have that occur?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Joanne, it's Brett. Yes, we did have that extra day on us. But if you average that out it'd be in the order of $5 million or something around that sort of number.", "Peter C. Farrell", "It might be more like $3 million to $4 million maybe, whatever.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of David Clair from Piper Jaffray.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I'm just wondering, can you talk about the Medicare prepayment reviews that are going out for CPAP? And do you expect those to have any kind of an impact on your business?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I'll turn that to Mick.", "Michael J. Farrell", "So there are always Medicaid getting involved with select customers and one of the biggest issues with our customers right at the moment for Medicare is the number of audits going through from -- versus just the prepayment is just another issue they deal with. We think that there are many opportunities in the growth area within the market for customers within their Medicare as well as their private pay customers. Medicare constitutes just around 20% to 30% of the market and for some customers it sort of 5% to 10%. So there are challenges with Medicare as a payor, but they're also a big chunk of the payor market, so there's some opportunities there as well.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I appreciate the color on HumiCare, that we should see that in fiscal 2013. Anything else in the pipeline you'd like to highlight?", "Peter C. Farrell", "I'll refer that to Geoff. Do you want to comment there?", "Geoff Neilson", "Well, obviously we're doing a controlled product launch of HumiCare in Europe, we expect to be launching in fiscal '13. We're currently putting together the 510(k)submission, which will go in shortly. So we could expect to launch that when that comes through with the FDA approval. We obviously have a pipeline that we're working with Grundler on in terms of humidification portfolio. But obviously, what we're looking at now is doing a proper job at launching this first product to homecare and then to the hospital.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Saul Hudassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A quick question, you mentioned some further plans for the ventilation business. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what that might entail?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, we've just, well, not just, at the end of the calendar year, released the Stellar 150 with iVAPS and basically we have a commitment to this space now, I mean Geoff has been building up the strategic business unit in respiratory care and we're going to continue with product evolution and we think in one case we might have -- it's probably not, you wouldn't describe it as a revolution, but we're working on some interesting future products. Put it that way.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe a question for Brett. The constant currency growth in R&D since it picked up in the last 3 quarters, is that kind of a new run rate that we should be thinking about? And is that tied into increased investment on the ventilation side of the business?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "There's probably, I mean, the acquisitions we undertook earlier in the year would probably, that would tick that up a little, by a couple of percent Saul as well. So probably our run rate would be a little low, probably sort of mid-teen type run rate. We've, I mean, at the end of the day, we really wanted to put our R&D dollars into the products we want to deliver into the markets. So that sort of drives the R&D spend. Through the course of this year, it's gone a little higher but it doesn't mean to say, necessarily trend down a little bit as we go through fiscal 2013 for example. So it's really dependent on where we're driving in terms of product development and what stage we're at on some of the projects.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, and to add a bit more there, there was an uptick with the health informatics, of course. We got, I mean, Don Darkin and his team did a terrific job getting EasyCare Online out and that was a monster challenge. And we have to do it. So a lot of resources were put into that and there were newer resources. And of course, as Brett says, the acquisitions.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen your next question will come from the line of David Stanton of Nomura.", "David Stanton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Look, just 2 things, firstly, Peter, perhaps you give us a bit of an update on the timeline for the results of the SERVE-HF trial. And for Brett, lower-than-expected tax rate than were expecting, should we be thinking that kind of tax rate ongoing?", "Peter C. Farrell", "David, on the survey, I mentioned that we hit 1,000 patients. The plan is 1,260 this is not something that's going to be over quickly.  And, however, what we are doing is we're doing a little side studies. I mean, the end points here are mortality and morbidity and they're pretty hard-nosed end points. But what we're also funding, some out of the ResMed Foundation and some direct from the company, are smaller studies where we're looking at ejection fraction, echocardiography and so on so forth. There should be some quick -- quicker results out of that. But I think to move the needle, it will be the survey and we're talking a couple of years more before we have anything that we can really talk about, sadly. It's expensive but that's just what you got to do.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "David, on the tax front. I'm comfortable with that 20%, 23% level at the moment in shorter-term. Basically, as we sort of ramp-up or increase production in Singapore, there's probably some opportunity there, the tax rate may adjust a little lower than that into the future. But at this point in time, I'm comfortable around that level.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Steve Wheen with JP Morgan.", "Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a question with regards to pricing. You've obviously mentioned in previous quarters that ASP declined is sort of [indiscernible]. So I just wonder if you're seeing the same sort of of dynamic at the moment, particularly when some channels we speak to are highlighting that on the APAP side, there has been some price increases off from you guys?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Put it this way, that's news to me and I think to people around the table. Gee, it's a lovely thought. But I think we're seeing something like a 2% to 3% to 5%, 5% is thankfully at the high end of what we're seeing. I mean, I had to predict that I mean, obviously, any time the DMEs and the HMEs  have an opportunity to bring in some bad news, which they have all result in price reductions, they will do so. So this is not a new game. This is a very, very old game. But we're not seeing anything untoward with ASPs and we're certainly not seeing any increases with our devices. We think they're worth more but it's hard to get people to pay for what they're really worth.", "Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Given the dynamic that's going on, in APAP could you see that particular category remains -- pricing remains flat and that it was not subject to price decline?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, let Mick take a shot at that.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Steve. Maybe what you're seeing is the blended ASP. There's some effects where it could be neutral, but certainly within a category, we're seeing that and I think on previous calls we've said a 5% to 7% per annum price reduction is what we see, we're saying in this call it's around 5%, which is about where we're at, but if you move from a CPAP to an APAP category and you move your mix in that, your blended ASP can appear neutral for a customer. But within the category of order set, there has been no increase in process and in this macroeconomic environment, I don't see going forward either and that sort of 5% go forward ASP reduction and we have to get off of it now, cost reductions and supply chain improvements, and to keep that gross margins really are is sort of where we're at.", "Peter C. Farrell", "I mean, obviously, internally, if we see much slower growth in the low-end and higher growth in the higher-end, well our ASP is going to go up as an average.", "Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, okay. And then just finally with regards to masks and your accessories in the U.S., you previously indicated that the DMEs haven't been, well, historically, have been refreshing the masks for their customers as regularly. Is that sort of -- are people trending now to replace masks in line with their reimbursement programs, now? Is that what's underpinning that growth?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, there's a lot of potential runway there. Clearly, when we look at the average number of masks sold per device per annum, we just see it is a huge opportunity for both us in the DMEs in HMEs. I don't know, Don, whether you want to add anything to that, but this is an area which -- when you've got millions of patients that are out there now and it's close to 6 million in the U.S. and we see it's less than 50% of what the revenues could be in that space. Less than 50%.", "Donald Darkin", "Yes. I think, as we are trying to push on this adherence compliance process, we're seeing more people coming on board with these programs. And, again, there's quite a bit of room here for us to adjust in a positive sense.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Belt & Company.", "Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just as a reminder, how much of the manufacturing is currently or has currently moved to Singapore?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Rob, you can take that? We're getting close to 50%.", "Robert Douglas", "Continual incremental and  there has been quite a shift from the last year of additional increments and yet it's not quite 50% but it's getting there on product mix basis.", "Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division", "And is 50% kind of a goal? Or would you go beyond that?", "Robert Douglas", "Well sort of in terms of the longer-term strategy, we'll be looking now at other sites and we actually have a facility in Malaysia as well that started up out of some of the headgear stuff that we've done and we'll be looking at that and other options to where we go in the future.", "Peter C. Farrell", "But the Singaporean environment is, they have well trained people and they're willing to work with you on the tax front and quality people with reasonable charges is attractive.", "Robert Douglas", "And capacity utilization, obviously, one of the other key factors in keeping it efficient, so we like Singapore.", "Ben C. Haynor - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And if I could follow up with one more. Last quarter, you talked about initiative to notify long-time CPAP patients with the benefits of newer devices. Could you just comment on what how's that coming along?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, well the warranty on devices. So in our manuals, it's a 5-year life, if you like. I mean, we get patients that have been using our devices happily for over 10 years and when you pull them apart, you sometimes get a bit of a surprise. But we are sort of trying to get the word out to people, particularly, since over the years, the algorithms have improved significantly, the noise levels have come down, the performance overall is just so much better. We think the patients will be better off by switching their units out and we do have a program to do that. And Rob maybe you can talk but -- more specifically we're trying to, if you like, focus on the S8, the previous line of products, and switch them out, S8 and even the S7, I guess. And there a lot of those still out there and the S7s are well and truly over the 5-year mark. And the S8s have now I think we're probably, I would imagine earlier a few hundred thousand now that are not at the 5-year mark. So we see that as an opportunity and we're sort of trying to make a full-court press to make it attractive for patients to upgrade. Rob, do you want to add?", "Robert Douglas", "I think that we just think the S9 is going to be providing better therapy and it makes good sense for people to move onto it.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And we recommend that at the end of the 5 years that you have a maintenance anyway. And why spend the money on maintenance if we have an attractive price for an upgrade like a trade-in as opposed to maintenance. And we are recommending that after 5 years, you really do need to have your device looked at. So instead of spending money out of your pocket on an old device, why not upgrade. That's the pitch.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities U.S.A.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I guess I just wanted to follow-up on what Mick was saying about the analysis that you guys had done on the 9 MSAs. I understand that those are comments on volume but I guess I'm just wondering what you saw with regard to pricing especially given the bifurcation you mentioned between the winners and losers, it seems like some of those winners would end up buying CPAPs in larger quantities, so would they then be getting better prices on this units, the masks and flow generators that their buying or not. So did you see any impact on your pricing in those cities?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Mike, good question. My comments we're actually about revenue. So saw that the winners that their revenue and, obviously, their volumes but their revenue grew and that the losers -- that they're revenue decline with us but on wash on a revenue basis it was a neutral element for us. So we were actually able to see that across those 9 cities we were revenue neutral. So my comments were around revenue not just volume.", "Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Got it. That's helpful. I guess, there has been some interest in the potential requirement of truckers getting tested for sleep apnea. And I guess there were sort of a league of the federal motor safety. -- Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration proposal this week or maybe it was last week. And I'm just wondering if that kind of was consistent with what you expected it to be, I think there were seeing a BMI over 35 they have to be tested. And then I'm just wondering what percentage of the population you think what kind of fall into that range.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. Well, none of that was a surprise. It was a surprise to us that it was the directive was issued and then later that day, it was retracted, and that was last week. It was sort of bizarre. I mean the Secretary LaHood comes in and says, it was a clerical error and it shouldn't have gone out. I mean we don't see any changes to that. We think it's going to come down from 35 to 30 BMI. And as I indicated in my remarks, BMI is a very loose way to decide on who needs a sleep test because 50% of people, in fact, with SDB, I will say, are not obese and it's due to other problems like retrognathia and Marfan syndrome and a whole bunch of other things. Obesity obviously impacts. There are 9 million commercial drivers in this country. We see it as a big opportunity. And frankly, we are just puzzled. We've been heavily involved in working with the National Transportion Safety Board and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In fact, our people have been, as I say, the staff really in terms of drawing the issue to peoples' attentions, we work with, as you know, Schneider trucking. We're also facilitating some publication of a study which was done with J.B. Hunt commercial drivers as well and that'll be coming out in the next few months. Again, suggesting that it's a very wise thing to have these people tested for sleep disorder breathing. As far as the prevalence, there's a wide range but the data that we think is pretty robust it's roughly 30% of all drivers have it at a level which is significant enough that they really do need to be sleep tested and treated. So it's big. And if you translate 30% of all those commercial drivers, I mean, it's 2.5 million to 3 million drivers and it could even be higher. I mean, as the data come in. The more we dig in these areas, the bigger the numbers or the bigger the prevalence tends to be. So yes, we think it is an incredibly exciting area and it's exciting because it's preventive of accidents, improves quality of life and reduces the cost for the carriers because there's less turnover by the drivers, they feel better, they work better, and we've got all the data, it's like the Holy Grail, if you prevent accidents, you improve peoples' quality of life and you save the company's money. And we think the FMCSA is being a little too prescriptive. But sending out that, publishing that they're going to do it and then the same day, retracting it, just is bizarre but maybe it's not a surprise, it is the government.", "Steven D. Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a really quick final question for Brett on the EPS impact of currency in the quarter. What was that?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, for us it was a negative impact of $0.02 on the bottom line this quarter.", "Operator", "We are now at the 1-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final comments.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, thank you, Angela, and thanks, everybody, for listening.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. You may begin.", "Constance Bienfait", "Thank you, Christine, and thank you, all, for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets of company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "Please limit your questions to 2 at any one time, so that we can accommodate as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue.", "With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell, ResMed's Chairman and CEO.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Great. Thanks, Connie. I'll begin as usual with a summary and then turn the call over to Brett to go through the numbers in a little more detail. And then if there's any time left, we'll take questions. Just kidding about that.", "First, finances, we finished with another very solid quarter. Global revenue in Q1 '13 grew 8% to approximately $340 million, up 12% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew an encouraging 15% year-over-year to $194.4 million. ROW revenue at $145.4 million grew 9% in constant currency terms, and we believe that our superior product offerings continue to drive our growth as does awareness of the seriousness and importance of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea.", "Net income for the quarter increased 41% to $71 million, while GAAP EPS increased a robust 48% to a record $0.49 for the quarter. And if we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.50. And I should note that the net income figure of $71 million is actually 21% of revenues, which shows a pretty solid performance.", "With respect to product performance, I'll start with masks. Again, all mask categories showed strong growth across all geographies. Accessories also grew strongly, as both large and small DMEs and HMEs are becoming more systematic and effective with resupplied patients who need them. With the success of MS recent mask line, we are seeing the benefits of the replenishment of these masks, as patients are happy to stay with what is most comfortable and most effective.", "Global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven again by AutoSet but also bilevels and VPAP Adapt, our adaptive servo-ventilation product. We are seeing excellent acceptance also for our new high-end S9 products from physicians, especially cardiologists.", "In the Americas, the S9 AutoSet and the VPAP Adapt ST did particularly well. Growth in the Flow Generator segment was also driven by a continued positive mix from basic CPAP to APAP due to the ongoing growth of home sleep testing, as well as physician preference to put patients on AutoSet since it provides flexible therapy but also improved patient comfort, as well as enhanced compliance.", "The new EasyCare Online system, which helps compliance management, continues to be well received, and we are seeing a solid uptake from existing but also new accounts. With new technology and superior algorithms, we believe we are taking Flow Generators, and EasyCare Online are certainly one of the benefits which our customers value.", "There is still uncertainty in Europe, but many countries had very good quarters, especially the U.K., Germany and the Nordics. Despite the challenging economic climate throughout all of Europe, as well as the fiscal constraints therein, the focus is still on treatment that keeps patients out of hospital and keeps them healthy. Our Stellar products did well again this quarter, and EasyCare Online is also gaining traction. We are continuing to see attention and focus on cardiology and its connection with sleep-disordered breathing. There was also a great deal more focused on compliance, especially in France, which, of course, positions us well with our high-quality products.", "In Asia Pac, we also had a solid quarter, particularly in Japan, due to sales in both Stellar and the AutoSet CS, which is equivalent to the Adapt product sold in the U.S. With the increase in reimbursement in Japan for respiratory and bilevel, we are seeing solid growth in the high-end Flow Generator line. Japan is also very focused on compliance and ensuring that the patient is using the therapy. We are also planning to replicate the Japanese cardiology model, if possible, in other parts of the world. Cardiologists see the quality of life improved on adaptive servo-ventilation therapy, even independent of the level of sleep-disordered breathing, that is in half-value [ph] patients. In short, we're seeing that cardiologists in Japan are actually using adaptive servo-ventilation to dry up the lungs and the pleura, independent of the extent of the sleep-disordered breathing.", "Emerging markets like India, China and the Middle East also did well in this quarter, with encouraging sales, in particular, of ventilation products in India. Ventilation sales again of Stellar 100 and Stellar 150 continue to grow, especially in Europe, Latin America and, as I indicated, in Japan and India. We are still awaiting regulatory approval in other geographies. Stellar is a very competitive noninvasive ventilation offering for the emerging markets, and the Stellar 150, which includes iVAPS, the intelligent Volume-Assisted Pressure Support system, which is our new automatic bilevel mode, is being extremely well-received. In the humidification area, the HumiCare D900 is now fully launched in Europe and is also being well-received, and we have made our submission to the FDA on the D900 as well.", "With respect to sales of Stellar products in the U.S., we've decided to discontinue our distribution partnership with CareFusion. It was a mutual decision, and it will allow both of us to more closely align the activities of our field organizations with the priorities of our own businesses. We continue to invest in the development of an advanced ventilation products, and we'll sell the Stellar products and HumiCare D900 to institutions through our own respiratory care sales force. And we've already begun to build that sales force.", "Our strategy is to sell Stellar into institutional care settings and provide homecare patients with our VPAP ST-A also with iVAPS. And just by parenthetically there, the VPAP ST-A with iVAPS has been approved for respiratory insufficiency, and we've launched this with the S9 platform. Our new Narval mandibular repositioning device, which was recently launched in the U.S., is being well-received, but it is, of course, early days. However, the Narval products, well-received in Europe where it's already been launched.", "On the home sleep testing front, by next month, 4 out of 5 of the largest commercial payers will require prior authorization for attended PSG in an effort to steer providers and patients towards home sleep testing. United goes live in all its territories, which constitutes 34 million lives on November 1, and certain regions under the world point plan will have the requirement in place by November as well. As a result, 70% of covered lives will need pre-authorization for PSG, and we estimated that in 2011, about 15% of all sleep tests were HST. We expect to see this at around 25% by the end of this calendar year. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, over 30% in the last 12 months and 41% in August. We're also participating in primary care physician awareness, as HST continues to advance with PCPs becoming more involved and more important, in fact, in the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient. Self-reported data suggests 10% of PCPs are using 1 of the 3 HST models, that is sleep lab HST, IDTF, mail order HST or PCP direct HST. And another 40% are evaluating HST. So we'll continue to grow.", "In addition to the studies mentioned in the press release on how diagnosing and treating sleep-disordered breathing can improve health care outcomes, lower hospitalization and readmission risks and also reduce medical expenses, CMS is rolling out 2 major pay-for-performance programs to cut readmission rates and improve hospital care overall. Hospitals with high Medicare patient readmission rates for heart attack, heart failure, as well as pneumonia, will face penalties, and those penalties are slated to grow over the next 3 years for hospitals that fail to drive down readmission rates. Whether it stays in place or works out is a question, of course, but the premise is good and the clinical data show treating sleep-disordered breathing does bring down hospital readmission. And that bodes well for us.", "Finally, David Pendarvis, Glenn Richards, our Medical Director, and I attended the second meeting at the Society of Anesthesia -- Anesthesiology and Sleep Medicine, which was held 2 weeks ago in Washington, D.C. The conference shows continued interest by clinicians in the perioperative management of sleep-disordered breathing. In fact, data presented showed that patients with sleep apnea have a significantly higher risk of post-surgery complications, ranging from longer hospital stays to even death. Several leading institutions, particularly the Mayo Clinic and Northwestern University, have initiated protocols to screen patients going under the knife for sleep apnea and to monitor and treat those patients after surgery. Their protocols we've had are extremely impressive, and we aim to collect some more detail from both these institutions.", "All of the peer-reviewed literature continues to make it abundantly clear that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is at best, seriously debilitating and costly to the health care system and, at worst, life threatening. These findings add to the continually mounting evidence connecting serious health disorders to untreated sleep-disordered breathing and point to the necessity of making the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing a standard of care in all medical practice.", "At this point, I'll turn over to Brett for additional detail on the financials.

I'm interested in regards to the round 1 and obviously the concerns of the competitive bidding. Yes, another quarter now. Have you seen any effects to the round 1 bidding process and certainly in terms of competitive behavior? Have you seen any changes from your competitors in terms of pricing behavior in the lead-up to the announcement, of course, of round 2?", "Unknown Executive", "Yes. I'll make 2 points on competitive bidding. We've had what I'll call a real-time pilot in the first 9 cities, the first 9 CMS calls and metropolitan statistical areas, 9 cities. We've had a number of quarters there. The 2 points are, firstly, that ASP declines in those 9 cities compared to the rest of the U.S. are in line. The second point is that growth for those 9 cities was in line with the rest of the market over the same period. Obviously, it was better with the winners than the non-winners within those cities, but it was awash overall. That's the message we gave 90 days ago, and, Matt, that hasn't changed in the last 90 days. It's still consistent with that.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. So just on that, did you see any change in -- or have you seen any change in competitive behavior around ASP outside of those 9 MSAs in the lead-up to the round 2 decision?", "Unknown Executive", "No. The behavior has been consistent both inside and outside, and it's consistent with what we have said, which is, depending on which SKU you look at, you generally got a 3% to 5% annualized reduction that can go slightly above that in some SKUs and slightly below that in some SKUs. That depends on the geography as we look at it, but it's sort of that mid single-digits number. And it hasn't changed significantly from -- within or outside the MSAs.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Excellent. Great. And, Peter, just back to you, just 1 follow-up question. You've often given us the industry growth rates and made comments around that before. Do you mind giving us your latest views on why you think the industry is growing at and whether you saw an uptick in the U.S. in the last quarter.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. No. We are not aware of any upticks, and we are -- most of the people, when you go to Medtrade and talk to various DMEs and HMEs and others, the 6% to 8% seems to be the figure, and that's -- so that's for the U.S. And our best guess, and obviously, it's much more complicated to get exact figures outside the U.S. because of the different geographies, but again, that looks to be consistent with the 6% to 8% growth. If you want a bit more of granularity, you might say, \"Well, it could be more like 5% to 7% in Europe and maybe a little higher, 7% to 9%, 8% to 10% in Asia Pacific.\" But overall, ROW also fits the bill of a 6% to 8%.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "First question for me just on the sales force for ventilation. How big do you think that will have to be?", "Peter C. Farrell", "We're going to start slowly, obviously, but I'm going to throw that one to Geoff Neilson, who's the President of Respiratory Care. But I think in the first year, we'll end up somewhere around 9 respiratory account managers, but Geoff, what are your plans? And then make them too vigorous, if you like.", "Geoff Neilson", "So we'll grow the respiratory care sales force, in line with growing revenue in respiratory care in the U.S. At the moment, that's obviously small, but we plan to grow it to having 1 respiratory care manager per region over time. And depending on how sales pick up, we'll grow it appropriately.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then one quick one for Brett. What was the net impact to currency on EPS? And any update on the medical device tax?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, David. For EPS impact on FX year-on-year was slightly negative but really less than $0.01 this quarter, so quite negligible. Medical devices tax, we still -- I think we're still waiting on the updated guidelines to come out. I mean, they're due out any time, but we think now they'll probably come out after the election. So really waiting to get some clarity from that before we give the market more clarity on it from how it's going to impact us.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Internally, David, we assume that it would not impact masks. Roughly, half the business would not be touched, and we also don't know about the devices. This -- again, we'll have to wait for the fine print, but we're even sort of contemplating that we may not even be stuck with the tax on the devices. But we don't know for sure yet.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "So based on the mask growth that you put up in the U.S., it looked like it may have slowed down a tad, but I was just wondering if you -- now that we're more than a quarter into this change to Medicare's resupply policy, if you think that had any impact on your mask growth at all.", "Peter C. Farrell", "It is early days, but we are seeing no impact whatsoever. Now we think the reason for that is that most people have been playing ball. I mean, I don't think that this CMS directive had much impact at all. I'll get -- make the comment on it, but it's -- if you look at the average, CMS will pay for 4 systems a year, and, in fact, the average is under 2. So we see it as a potential -- a significant potential area for growth. But Mick, do you want to comment?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Mike, I'd make 3 points on this area about CMS documentation. The first point is this is just Medicare. So it's 25% of the U.S. market, which is about 10% to 12% of the global market or under 12% of the global market. Number two, they made changes to documentation but no changes to frequency or the reimbursement rates. So it's just changes to the documentation. And number three, that those changes to documentation, after some further clarification, which took 2 or 3 months because it's the government after that clarification came out, customers were pretty quick to change their systems, whether it's an IVR where you press 1 to say that the system is dysfunctional or it's a call script that requires that question and documents it or it's a formal written sign-off process where the patient signs off on nonfunctional use. So those 3 things, I think, have played out and sort of minimized effect, if any, really, of this in terms of -- over the long term.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then my second question is on a new technology. I've been at TCT this week, and there's a lot of excitement around renal denervation. And obviously, it's targeting hypertension initially, but there's talk of a lot of other potential indications, including OSA and complex sleep apnea -- or sorry, central sleep apnea. So I'm just wondering if you had taken a look at this therapy and whether or not it's something that you would view as a potential threat to CPAP therapy down the road. Admittedly, this is years off, years off and years off in the future before it would potentially even be approved, but...", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. No. It's hard for me to envision -- or first, let me make the point but JNC7, the Joint National Commission on the diagnosis, management and treatment of hypertension, has suggested or made the statement that the #1 cause out of 9 identifiable factors for hypertension is untreated sleep-disordered breathing, of which, obviously, obstructive sleep apnea is the main manifestation. Now the renal nerve innovation or the use of the barbecuing of the artery, it's hard to see how that connects. It appears to work in drug-resistant hypertension, and we know that 83% -- well into the 80s of drug-resistant hypertension patients do have sleep-disordered breathing. But if you have sleep-disordered breathing and your hypertension is ameliorated by the renal denervation, then you still need to have the sleep-disordered breathing treated because it doesn't stop the other -- the sympathetic neural activity that's associated with the catecholamines. So I just found this such a long bow. I can't even imagine that this would be a treatment for any form of sleep-disordered breathing. And if it were, it would only be in the central area. Because looking at what sleep-disordered breathing is, it's really a mechanical issue, and it's due to the -- as your diaphragm moves, you create negative pressure, the air flows into the lungs and, of course, that causes a negative pressure in the upper airways. So if you have a floppy upper airway and wherever it may be in the pharynx, the velo, hypo, oropharynx, it's a mechanical issue. So I think it's a very, very long bow. Now maybe, maybe there are some impact on central sleep apnea, but it's -- you'd -- I'd like to see a hell of a lot of compelling data to show that it would impact it. But obviously, with central sleep apnea, we have an open airway. It's not the same -- it's not a mechanical issue, it's a neurologic issue. And because it's neurologic, it's -- you could say, \"Well, okay, maybe it's -- it could be impacted by anything that -- it appears with the neuro system.\" But I'd like to see some compelling data before we're sold on it.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My first question is on manufacturing. Just wondering how sort of far through you are, your migration to Singapore, how much more capacity there is to ship production there.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, we -- currently, it's roughly for masks, interfaces and devices. It's roughly 54% of our total production. Given how easy it is to work with the Singaporean government as opposed to more socialist governments, we will be probably moving more manufacturing into Singapore. It's got an extraordinarily favorable tax rate, and you can sit down with the Singaporean government. And when they talk about academic business and governments working together, it's one of the weirdest things in the world, they actually mean it. So you actually sit down with people that actually want to help you and not hinder you with more regulations and more workplace relation issues and so forth. Australia, frankly, is a nightmare of industrial relations. But having said that, we will be continuing to invest in Singapore for ease of doing business, meaning regulations and working relationships and an extraordinarily favorable tax rate, which is well under 10%. So if I had to guess, we'll just keep expanding in Singapore, and I wouldn't be surprised, that this is -- I haven't looked at the actual numbers, but I wouldn't be surprised if we are more like 75% this year. But Rob, do you want to make a comment on that since you are closer?", "Robert Douglas", "Yes, Ian, we're really happy with the way Singapore is going. And so the long-term plan was then progressively increasing capacity and putting production up there. We've been really happy with the capacity that's there off a pretty small footprint, and we see a lot more efficiency guidance. So that trend will keep going. We're not going to jump off and [indiscernible]. We'll be progressive always as things move up. We're also pretty happy with our Malaysian factory, which is up and running, doing headgear. And down the track, we might see more options in that area as well.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "My second question, just looking at pricing and price declines, one thing, the payback from the industry is pretty consistent that over the last 5 years, most of the price declines have been seen in low-end Flow Gens, whereas mask pricing has been relatively stable. Just wondering firstly if that's true. And secondly, have you seen any changes to that sort of in recent times?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, Ian, pricing is something that you deal with every day. And as far as pricing pressures go, I think we've been fairly consistent. We've expected somewhere around the 4% to 5% annual decrease in prices, and obviously, we need to keep ahead of the curve. And with manufacturing efficiencies, we've been able to do that. We don't see the terrain. Look, it's challenging. And the irony of this market is that most of the pricing pressure is actually driven by competitors as opposed to the customers, and it's just one of those weird markets where as you can see from our numbers, given the growth rates being around 6% to 8% and our growth rates in constant currency being around 12%. But if you look at the net income, the revenues, I mean, obviously, that's a reflection of a number of things. But improvements in the valuable growth improvements with the S9 platform and, obviously, the movement from basic CPAP to APAP, pretty encouraging. But I'll throw that question, I mean, make Don -- maybe Don Darkin can talk about masks, and you can talk about devices or -- but there's nothing scary that we're seeing. That's just the way of the world. People want to buy...", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I wasn't suggesting any scare. I just [indiscernible] was there any differential in the price declines between masks and Flow Gens.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Don, do you want to go first?", "Donald Darkin", "Yes, I don't -- Ian, I don't think there's anything that's headline with our expectations, and quite frankly, we're tracking pretty much as we expected across this year's fiscal. So there's no real difference at all in -- not from what we're seeing.", "Michael J. Farrell", "I mean, all I'd add is that the conversation with customers and really payers in this space is starting to turn from a discussion around price to one about value. We're moving away from just a discussion around utilization management, which is, can you do competitive bidding and move from x to  point 9x on a unit price to are you saving money for my health care system by keeping these patients out of hospital? So the discussions are moving to a higher level, and we're having them with customers and with their customers' payer groups to change that conversation from more utilization management, which focuses on price, to one on care management, which focuses on sort of the return on investment that a payer gets by putting a high-value patient on the VPAP Adapt and keeping them out of the ICU and CCU and similarly for an LSA patient on CPAP or even better on AutoSet. So that's sort of where the discussions are going in, but no big differential to your question between masks and Flow Gens on that pressure.", "Peter C. Farrell", "But having said that, and I agree, but moving from utilization management to care management is a lot easier to say than do. And there's a lot of work that we have to put in. We're putting a lot of time and effort into healthy economics by gathering data, showing people what -- in fact, this is -- as we said in the press release, it is the holy grail. I mean, we've given up collecting testimonials on the quality of life because it's just real. I mean, it's there. And so it's not something we're surprised at. The second thing is we're seeing more and more data on savings of inpatient and outpatient costs, particularly with these readmission rates. I mean, it is going to become standard of care because, simply, if -- unless you treat the sleep-disordered breathing, if you have 25% to 30% of the adult population with sleep-disordered breathing at some level, I should stress. That's an AHI greater than 5. Do they all need treatment? Well, they do if they've got a co-morbidity such as hypertension, diabetes, reflux nocturnal and depression and on and on. But we are seeing this moving very favorably. And the third thing is what we're seeing and a lot more encouragingly is that we're seeing not only is the disease process in these co-morbidities being slowed, it's actually in some cases being reversed. So if you've got quality of care on your side, you've got reduced cost on your side and you've got reduced disease progression. All this translates into a very favorable environment going forward. Now there will be challenges, but we're very comfortable in the space we're in.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So I've got a couple of questions for you, please. The -- can you break out for us what's going on with the international generator business? How big a chunk is Stellar today and what the growth rates are in underlying blowers for CPAP within that broader", "number?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, as you know, we don't get very granular, Ben, but I will say that the Stellar 100 and the Stellar 150 is selling extraordinarily well. And if you look at percentages of devices, it's a higher percentage -- a much higher percentage -- well, considerably higher percentage ROW compared to the U.S. But with the push into institutional sales, it's going to be built up gradually. And we're -- as I said in my remarks, we're targeting the Stellar for NIV, noninvasive ventilation institutional sales, and the homecare would be the VPAP ST-A with iVAPS. The reimbursement favors that kind of push. But do you want to add any more, Geoff or Mick?", "Geoff Neilson", "No. I think you said it all.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So just to finish that point of Peter, the growth rate of underlying international CPAP blowers is consistent with the total for that segment, if nothing else?", "Peter C. Farrell", "The growth rate ROW is less with the blowers, for sure. It's, in terms of granularity, hard to know, but it's a little -- as I said before, it's a little less in Europe and a little higher in Asia Pac. But it comes out -- Ben, it comes out at about the same. We think the market's growing at about 6% to 8%. It's a little lighter in Europe and a little higher in Asia Pac.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just my second question, if I may. Thinking about gross margin and the move into -- the further move into Singapore, as well as the mix. As you go through the next couple of quarters, Peter, you start to annualize the launch of the S9 bilevel. I think that's in the June quarter, so your comps will get a little bit tougher. Are you confident you can continue to see a strong generator growth kind of in the middle to back half of next year on generators with that dynamic? And then second, can you continue to see gross margin trending up with currency staying stable?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, our best guess, as Brett said, is that the gross margin will remain in the 60% to 62% range. We're seeing -- it's -- we considerably hope, Ben, as you would obviously know, the change with the HST to AutoSet. That's extremely helpful. The price pressures are greater at the low-end CPAP, but the growth is much lower there and there's the switch with the requirements of pre-authorization, et cetera. So I think we see that area. I mean, this is just me talking now. But I think this time next year, we're going to see -- of all the tests, I think it's going to be closer to 50%, it could even be higher, depending upon how aggressive the payers are with the PSG authorization area. It could even be -- I might have to go crazy, it could be 75%, but I mean, that's just sort of in the lap of the gods. But...", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. But the point [indiscernible].", "Peter C. Farrell", "So we don't -- strong price -- I don't see -- we don't see any -- sorry, what's that?", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I was just saying that even in the face of more difficult comparisons on bilevel as you annualize the launch of the CPAP, auto -- the auto PAP trends remain strong.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, they do. And we're actually very optimistic with the Stellar products. I mean, they are -- the Stellar 150 with iVAPS is being extraordinarily well-received. Do you want to say a word about that -- or Brett, do you want to comment? And maybe Geoff after Brett.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Just on them, I mean, we have -- the product mix has been favorable for us, and we've got, I mean, the CPAP to APAP Chief there. Obviously, the bilevel is coming to the S9 box, and they've done particularly well. So those factors are there. And if you're going to be realistic there, it's quite a nice uptick from that. I do think that mix will still be favorable for us going forward, Ben, but maybe not to the extent that we've seen. But I still think we'll see some favorable mix coming through, which will help us.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And Geoff, do you want to say...", "Geoff Neilson", "So all I would add is that with iVAPS being very well-received globally, particularly in Japan more recently, I know that we've got iVAPS on the S9 platform. Obviously, that's going to give us a very good margin product, and we expect to see that growing quickly over the coming quarters.", "Peter C. Farrell", "I guess in short, Ben, we're cautiously optimistic that we can stay ahead of the curve.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a question on rest of world. I was very impressed with your rest of world constant currency growth. And, in particular, I listened to the comments last quarter about Japan being a bit lumpy and had been a good quarter. It would seem that it's happened again in this quarter. Just wondering if you think we should think about Japan as being something about a step-up that will continue on for the rest of this -- at least the rest of this year.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, David, the one thing that I noted in the comments was that as opposed to reimbursement cuts, which everybody expects, this was, in fact, a reimbursement uptick. And also, there's very favorable environment for cardiologists to adapt -- or take on adaptive servo-ventilation, and we are actually planning on taking some physicians [indiscernible] heart failure, one particularly influential heart failure expert from the U.S. to Japan to talk to some of the cardiologists there, the heart failure cardiologists, to see if we can leverage some of their results. And I mean, it's a critical mass of cardiologists in Japan who are now have -- doing not only adaptive servo-ventilation, they're not involving sleep physicians at all, they're just doing it themselves. So we -- yes, we -- I think we need a little bit more information, a little bit more data. I mean, we're anxious to see what we can sort of -- what lessons we can learn and then apply to other markets, in particular, the U.S., which, of course, is our, by far, in a way, our biggest market. But I would say, yes, we are pretty encouraged about Japan and not just with adaptive servo-ventilation but also with Stellar, with Teijin. And Geoff knows that he needs to improve his numbers. But with Teijin and Fukuda Denshi, both of our Japanese distributors are really impressed with the Stellar product.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And obviously, I'm very happy with the number there, Peter.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Oh, okay. Good. But they need to be...", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Would it be fair to say that the growth that we've seen in Asia Pac you've mentioned is a bit stronger than Europe? Is Japan a very important part of that stronger growth?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes. Yes. But also India and China. So India -- obviously, the base is -- the growth rates are bigger in India or in China, but the base is smaller. But we are very optimistic about India -- about both India and China and Japan. We've been in there for 15-or-so years. I mean, that's always been a good market, and we don't see that changing.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask another question focusing on U.S. mask business. Certainly, we've seen trend towards much stronger growth in masks, driven by these replenishment programs. I know you've talked about a market growth of 6% to 8%. So presumably, as we move through the process, we're going to see market growth come back towards that market growth rate. I'm just wondering where you think we're up to in that trend?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, it's a difficult mix, David, and I'll throw the question to Don. But -- and just to make a comment. As you put more and more patients onto treatment, you've got this growing replenishment opportunity. And if you look at our business, the -- that is an extraordinarily fast-growing area, and there's a lot of potential to go from just under 2 masks per patient per year to 3 to 4. So there's a lot of potential there if the patient does, in fact, need a new mask. And so we think that it's a pretty attractive space, actually. And so I don't see anytime soon the growth rates coming back to the 6% to 8% in the masks space. But Don, what are your feelings? And maybe Mick can chime in as well.", "Donald Darkin", "Yes. Similarly, I agree with you, Peter. We don't see that coming off anytime soon. I think with the growth in the segments and the strength we have in those channels, it's going to be around those numbers. We're seeing a mild dip in numbers along with our expectations due to the new masks that have been launched this period. It's pretty much in line with what we think, and we'll probably be back over the next period as people start to look at the relative merits of those new masks. But as far as this space is concerned, it still remains very healthy.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, and, I mean, to Don's point, if competitors are launching new products, people are going to try it. But it takes a while for the water to flow under the bridge, and we've done our own comparisons. We feel comfortable, very comfortable, I should say, with our products. But other people have got to [indiscernible], and -- but we're confident that we have a little bit of air between us and the other guys. But...", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, all I'd add is that there is runway left on replenishment. We can get more movement there, but in addition to that, compliance systems and the focus on adherence is becoming a greater and greater focus for our HME customers and their customers, the payer. And as they look more at that, they have more systematized approaches to it. We launched the product, EasyCare Online, which was a major global initiative that the team was able to bring to the market. And now the data, as to whether you're using your device or not, is taken to the physician, the payer and the patient from the cloud. And that visibility to compliance rates allows customers to better treat their patients and health care systems to better keep their patients out of hospitals. So that focus on adherence should provide some long-term runway to growth of replenishment revenues like masks and other accessories, tubing, filters and even repair, because every 5 years or so, you should replace the device as well.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Mick, in terms of replenishment, do you think the majority of your DME customers have gone on to that and have become a serious [indiscernible] to their business or we're still seeing maybe a tier of DMEs that you're doing?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, David, I would say a majority of the large nationals have moved, although there's still some further improvements that they can make to their systems. But the next tier down is the large regionals has a lot more room for improvement on that front. And frankly, at the moment, PAP level, the local regionals, there is still, sadly, a large segment where the focus on long-term compliance and adherence and replenishment is not even part of the conversation. It's part of the conversation we have with them but not necessarily something they're implementing yet. So the answer to that is there's at least -- of the 3 tiers, there's 2 tiers where we've got considerable room for improvement.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just going to rattle off a few here just to get a better sense of gross margin potential and mix. And I know you haven't given this out in the past, but on the generator side, would you care to share the mix of CPAP autos and bilevels, sort of where that is today and potentially where that can go? And then one on the distributor side. Can you give a sense of how many in the U.S., how may distributors you're dealing with today? And has that consolidated to any extent with competitive bidding?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, Anthony, firstly, it'd be a first if we started to share granularity on -- we've said that the APAP is growing very fast compared to the fixed pressure CPAPs. But we just -- first of all, competitors would love to know it. And so we don't share that information about product mix. I'm not going to go any further than that. And your second question, what was that again?", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "With regard to distributor consolidation.", "Peter C. Farrell", "I'll throw that to Mick. But there is a little bit, if you want to address it.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, I mean, the answer, Anthony, is that we're not going to -- obviously, going to the, again, the granularity of the number of customers we have now and had 12 months ago, but we will give the general trend that there is industry consolidation at the HME level. You've seen the public announcements of Linde buying LinCare. You've seen the public announcements of Apria buying the assets of Praxair, and there are other acquisitions that have happened, obviously. But in terms of this industry, it's got a large degree of fragmentation. This consolidation has gone on and will continue to go on, and it's probably cataloged a little by competitive bidding. But we have good relationships with the large nationals, and we have good relationships with the regionals. And we expect those to continue on throughout that consolidation. But it's a trend that's been there, and we expect to continue at its same rate but not to change dramatically.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "One quick one, if I may. The high-class problem here, $890 million in cash, and I know about a year ago or a little bit more than that now, there was an effort to sort of look at things outside strategically. I'm just wondering if we can get an update there.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Yes, well, we've spent -- if you look at 2012 and 2013, just the first quarter, we spent close to $400 million just simply doing share buyback, and that's one use of the capital there. But you're right, I mean, $890 million, even if you take out the total amount of debt, it still leaves us, give or take a bit, with $600 million. So we have dry powder, and we are continually scanning the horizon. And basically, we are looking -- we're not going to get into movie-making or sailboat-making or anything like that. We're in the sleep business, and that's where we're -- sleep and respiratory care business, and that's where we're staying, obviously. But you saw the purchase of BiancaMed. We're absolutely delighted with that. We're also delighted with the 12.5% tax rate, and then we're also delighted with the fact that the Irish government, like the Singaporean government, want to sit down and talk to you. And you get academics and the business guys and the government guys all in one room and they really do want to help you, and we get some help there with the R&D. But we are continually looking at -- as you know, we've got a ResMed Ventures and Initiatives group, which is headed up by Jim Hollingshead. And virtually, every day, there's something that comes across Jim's desk, and we take a look at it. So I guess what we're looking at is new technologies that dovetail into the respiratory or sleep business. We're also looking at people that are out there that we can take -- oh, as Connie just shoved down to my nose, of course, we did buy Grundler in the humidification space. I mean, I hadn't forgotten that, Connie, but thanks. And also [indiscernible], of course, with the compliance where we're now able to get compliance measurements. It's not just for our products but also for competitive products. And we are making a push, obviously, in the area of dental sleep medicine. We've just got FDA approval, working through the reimbursement for mandibular repositioning devices, Kristie Burns. And that's also in Jim Hollingshead's group, we're making a big push on dental sleep within the U.S. environment. And we're kind of encouraged by the strides we are making there. But yes, there's no question we have plenty of dry powder, but we are also looking carefully of what's around. But when you look at where to invest, we're looking for things that potentially can grow 20% top and bottom line. And, I mean, there's just not that many opportunities. But if you come across something, Anthony, give us a hoy.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Hurren from UBS.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I understand you don't want to break out products, but previously, we've discussed publicly the loss of market share in the bilevels and servo-ventilators and those sort of things and where you think you are today following launch. Has that market share come back or has that been rebuilt, you just were doing organic growth now?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I think if you look at the growth figures, if you step back strategically and you look at our market growing at 6% to 8% globally and then you look at our numbers 40%, 41% up at the bottom line on net income and net income of 21% to revenues and you look at the gross margin of 61.4%, that clearly reflects a higher value products growing very well. And that, obviously, is adaptive servo-ventilators. So we are really doing extremely well in getting back lost business in the adaptive servo-ventilation area, and we're also seeing nice growth now that every -- the bilevels are in the S9 platform. You can argue we should have done it sooner, maybe we should have, but clearly, the numbers are reflective of the fact that we are, if you like, back on deck.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just another question. You talked before about the potential for home sleep testing to become a very big part of the market, in short, become aggressive with this pre-authorization. Do you see any risk in there? And what are you seeing on the ground during this changeover period? I guess I'm just curious to see if there's any patients falling in between the cracks as 1 system transitions to another.", "Peter C. Farrell", "It's very -- it's such early days, what works. But will the primary care physicians adopt it in the way we like to see them? They likely will use independent testing facilities, the IDTFs, or the sleep labs going to go out and start marketing to the PCPs and say, \"Hey, look, don't worry about it. We're going to offer you both PSG, even though it's pre-authorization. We should be able to get that, but we'll also offer you HST.\" We think the smart sleep labs are offering both. Obviously, they want more patients going through PSG because they make more money, but it's a very complex mix. But I -- if I had to guess, I'd say that we're going to see a certain number of PCPs as they get comfortable with HST because they take it up themselves and go straight to AutoSet, that's the easiest thing to do. You don't have the option of going to a lab to have the pressure set. It has to be automatic. The good news is that there are several papers out showing that, in fact, ironically, that if you go HST to APAP, you in fact get average along with those paper by Rosanne [indiscernible] and Susan Redline at Harvard. But this was multiple groups. I think it was 7 or 8 sleep centers across the country, and they show, in fact, almost an hour or more per night usage on the average and compliance that was around 12% up. So, in fact, rather than the sleep labs, they used to say that it was really unprofessional and bad medicine, and what we're finding is that if you do use HST, it's so much easier for the patient, it's so much cheaper, so much more convenient. And APAP works just as well as we've known that for over a decade, works just as well, the 6 APAP set in the lab. In fact, the data is showing, if anything, it's at least as good and, in some cases, even better. So this is not a complicated area, and I think we're going to see far more involvement of PCPs but also in addition, specialists, like cardiologists and endocrinologists, perhaps. If you're doing HST, you couldn't think of anything simpler, and the treatment itself is safer than an aspirin. So it's almost no downside. So complex area, very early days, but we see continuing good growth in the space and more and more non-sleep-trained physicians implementing the therapy and sending all the tough ones to the sleep physicians. Stuff they can't work out, they'll send back to the sleep lab.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Dan, what I'll add to that is you've got -- your question was about risks as you move from PSG to HST. We've got risk mitigation in that we have 3 models that are being trialed out in the ecosystem there. There's IDTFs and there's PCP direct, but there's also sleep labs conducting home sleep testing. And you heard in the remarks early that 40% this quarter, 40% of sleep labs are now offering home sleep testing as an alternative, and we think that offering that choice is actually good for the patient and can reduce what we call leakage through the value chain. So we're mitigating the risk by looking at 3 models. And the market is choosing and the patients are choosing, and the sleep labs are helping facilitate patients to get their choice. And we think that's a good thing for patients, for the payers and for the long term of our industry. So there's more money available to keep the patients on therapy compliant and out of hospital.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Couldn't have said it better.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So I think you're saying that there is sufficient home sleep testing capacity there now as the sort of insurers push hard?", "Michael J. Farrell", "There's actually scalable models being set up so that as patients come to these new modalities, they can scale with the patients that they come through. So the answer is capacity is there and capacity is available to grow through multiple methods. So in short, Dan, yes.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Thank you. I think we're probably good to close here, Christine.", "Operator", "Yes, we are at the 1-hour mark. Please go ahead with any final remarks.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I will. First off all, for those of you still on the call, thank you for joining us. But more importantly, I would like to thank all our employees for their hard work, dedication and continued exemplary performance. We are delighted with your commitment and loyalty and efforts. And so we all here around the table, thank you very much. And that's it. That's [indiscernible].", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Adrean, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.", "Constance Bienfait", "Thank you, Adrean, and thank you all for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose. Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earning, new product development, or new markets for the company\u2019s products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed\u2019s SEC filings such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you may access through the company\u2019s website at www.resmed.com. Please limit your questions to two at anyone time and then you can place yourself back in the queue.", "With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell, ResMed\u2019s Chairman and CEO. Peter, go ahead.", "Peter C. Farrel", "Thank you coming for that exciting introduction. Thank you again for joining us and I will begin with some summary remarks and then turn the call over to Bret Sandercock, CFO for more financial details. And then of course, as usual take questions.", "So first, a brief financial summary, which as I said Bret will fill in the details a little bit more later. We finished with another extremely robust quarter, you might be well and truly tired of hearing this. But this now represents a 72 consecutive record quarter for 18 straight calendar years in which we have grown the top line.", "Global revenue in the second quarter of 2013 grew 13% to $377 million, up 14% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in the Americas grew 16% to $212 million and ROW revenue increased 10%, or 12% in constant currency terms to $165 million. We believe that our continued market growth has been driven by, primarily by two factors.", "First, the fact that more people are finally beginning to accept that untreated sleep-disordered breathing is in fact the major public health problem.", "And secondly our superior product quality coupled with our full solution offerings, which I will come back to in a moment. Net income for the quarter increased 24% to $78 million, while GAAP EPS increased 26% to $0.53 for the quarter. If we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.54.", "Our global growth in flow generators this quarter was primarily driven again by our high-end devices with strong sales of AutoSet, bilevels, and our Adaptive Servo-Ventilation products, the VPAP Adapt, as well as Stellar 100 and 150 products.", "And as we had originally anticipated, having our PAP products configured on the smaller quarter and more appealing S9 platform has worked out quite successfully. We also believe we continue to take share in the AutoSet space, as well as continued to gain back share in bilevels, and there is still a plenty of room for us to continue to grow.", "The new EasyCare Online Compliance Management system continues to be adopted broadly and we are seeing solid uptick from both existing as well as new accounts.", "Products and programs which provide superior therapy and better compliance, bring value to patients, customers, and payors. It\u2019s all about driving outcomes for these constituencies and having the data to drive compliance and the hearings to improve lives and save healthcare costs is the right space to be.", "With respect to Masks, all categories continued to do well. Mask Accessories also grew quite strongly, but large and small HMEs continue to see the benefits by themselves and patients and being able to be more systematic about supplying replenishment products to those patients who need them.", "With the great success of our recent mask offerings, we are reaping the benefits of the great supply of these masks as patients remain happy to stay with what has been most comfortable and effective for them.", "And I\u2019m proud to announce that on behalf of the ResMed team, ResMed has emerged as the most preferred mask brand based upon a statistically significant global study done in the timeframe, August to September last year by UK-based market research firm, DVL Smith. The sleep apnea patient survey with current PEP users and use their device for at least four nights per week and they were all using every mask top that is full face, nasal or pillows, and also that we are using all brands.", "Now immediately, we initiated and paid to the cost of the study, but we had no input whatsoever to the studies conclusions, so we\u2019re very pleased about that. With that said, we are keeping a watchful eye on the recently released competitive masks. Also as an aside, we plan to launch our own suite of ResMed masks during the latter part of this year, or during this calendar year.", "Turning to the rest of the world and despite the fact that there is still a lot of economic uncertainty in Europe, the UK, and Germany and France in particular. These territories, Germany, France, and the UK delivered solid quarterly results. And regardless of the challenging economic climate and covenant fiscal restraints, the market is still focused on treatment which keeps patients out of the hospital and keeps them healthy. Sleep-disordered breathing treatment does this in spades.", "France has just initiated a new telemonitoring requirement to track complaints and we think this is an appropriate step and bodes well for us a period in the monitoring solutions. AutoSet CS, which is our Adaptive Servo-Ventilator product in Europe, and the Stellar products again did well in most parts of Europe. The Asia-Pacific region also had a solid quarter with robust sales in Japan, particularly with Stellar and also AutoSet CS, our ASP product as I said, as well as the Bi-Level product portfolio. There is also great focus on compliance in Japan with data capture hopefully lessening the need for so many physician visits, or at least shortening the time the patient needs to spend in the physicians\u2019 office.", "With respect to Ventilation, the VPAP ST-A is making inroads in most geographies. And as I\u2019ve already mentioned sales of Stellar are quite robust, especially in Germany and Japan. In the U.S, we are in the process now of hiring respiratory care managers to go on referral points in hospitals. And we expect this to drive our home ventilation sales.", "On the HST or Home sleep testing front, about 60% of commercially covered U.S adult lives are now under a pre-authorization requirement for attended PSG or Polysomnography in an effort by payers to steer providers and patients towards HST. This is anticipated together 75% of commercially covered loss by the spring.", "We estimated the end of 2012 about 25% of all sleep tests for HST. And we expect this number to grow to 50% or over by the end of this calendar year. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST averaging about 35% in the last 12 months, which rose to 40% in November in response to pre-authorization enforcement. We are also involved in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance with PCP becoming increasingly more important in the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient.", "As flagged in the press release, we\u2019ve been pioneering a market dynamic for several years that is now starting to get traction. The sleep market is not just about selling equipment in order to treat SDB, but it is about forming relationships with our customers, the HMEs and the payors. The combination of our range of high quality flow generators, the best and most comfortable masks and accessories and easy to access robust data makes ResMed in our view, the best value proposition for all providers. In short, we provide for full integration.", "The sleep market is one of the first healthcare markets to actually provide useful treatment data and has done so for about a decade. Good growth would account for using EasyCare Online is evidence of its value. We feel we are also getting traction with payors in making the case for CPAP therapy.", "With more understanding of the prevalence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing and obviously it\u2019s association with chronic comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes, good depression and so on, the case to reimburse SDB therapy and authorization and continues resupply makes more and more sense. And as evidenced by the shift to pre-authorization to PSG, payors understand that HST is making sleep testing easier and cheaper for everyone.", "In addition, putting patients on Autoset rather than straight CPAP, even after in live sleep test is more efficient to the HME and in fact more effective for the patient.", "As recognized time and again treating SDB has proven to be preventative from multitude of other more severe and costly care comorbidities certainly more costly than simply treating sleep-disordered breathing. In short, it is easy to make a compelling case for the payors. As we\u2019ve noted many times over the diagnosis and treatment of SDB is the holy grail of medical treatment for three reasons. It drastically improves patients\u2019 quality of life, it slows down and even improves concomitant kind of morbidities and additionally reduces in patient and out-patient costs.", "Now, let me turn the call over to Brett for some additional financial detail, and then we\u2019ll take question. So over to you Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "", "Great, thanks, Peter. Revenue for the December quarter was $376.5 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Unfavorable currency movements reduced our second quarter revenues by approximately $4.1 million. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Income from operations for the quarter was $92.1 million, an increase of 37% over the prior year quarter.", "Net income for the quarter was $77.9 million, an increase of 24% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.53, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the December quarter was 61.8%, up sequentially from Q1 FY13.", "On a sequential basis our gross margin continue to benefit from a favorable product mix. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin for fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 60% to 62%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $107.8 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency term, SG&A expenses increased by 8%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.6% compared to the year ago figure of 30.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2013.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $30.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses also increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1% compared to the year ago figure of 8.2%.", "Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2013, reflecting a continuing strong Australian dollar and also continued investment in our product pipeline.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $9.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 24.2%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rate in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 21% to 22%.", "On December 7, 2012, the IRS released their final regulations for the medical devices excise tax. Following our valuation in the regulations, we believe a relatively small number of our products are subject to the medical device tax and as such estimate the annualized financial impact from the tax to be less than $1 million.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail; overall sales in the Americas were $211.8 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $164.7 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 12% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments; in the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.7 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and Bi-Level devices. Masks and other sales were $118.1 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year quarter, underpinned by strong contributions across our masks product range and continued growth in accessories.", "For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $108.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $55.9 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 16%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 13% while masks and others increased by 16%.", "Cash flow from operations was $93.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $19.3 million.", "Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for consideration of $40 million. For the first half of fiscal year 2013, we have repurchased 1.2 million shares for consideration of $48.1 million.", "At the end of December, we had approximately 7.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. During fiscal year 2013, we intend to purchase at least 2 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our buyback program, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $657 million. And at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion.", "I\u2019ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And we have Dan Hurren from UBS online with the question. Please go ahead.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "", "Well, good morning, everyone, thanks for taking my question. I would just like to explore that a little bit about product launches and is there anymore detail on what product launches are required do you think to maintain growth as the comps gets tougher through the second half?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, Dan, as you are aware, we\u2019ve been on this kick for many years and then we typically come out with new mask offering, somewhere in the timeframe of nine to 12 months, and new devices tend to be more like 18 months to two years. So this was just continuing what we normally do, but the focus is on improving comfort, reducing noise, and also attending to reduce COGS. But maybe I will throw that question for more detail to Don Darkin, and Don, would you like to say a few words about product releases?", "Don Darkin", "This is Don. We\u2019ve currently had a fairly robust pipeline over the last three to five years. We are really just following that plan out. We\u2019ve got a number of offerings in all segments coming through this calendar. And it\u2019s just wisely relying about as planned previously. So as Peter mentioned, they are addressing the main high points of mainly in comfort and costs. But essentially they will be \u2013 we are fairly comfortable that they will be through this fiscal end calendar year launching.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thanks very much. And one just that is on a different track. Can you just remind us again on the potential new flow from the SERVE-HF study et cetera?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Right. At the end of January we\u2019ll be pretty much at the full complement of patients for the study. But and we\u2019ve got some studies ongoing which probably won\u2019t complete their patient requirements until the end of May. But we are looking at a \u2013 still a couple of years. We had a meeting on the cardiovascular space just this week. And people are feeling pretty comfortable with the compliances being addressed the way it should be addressed that the units mainly in Germany, but also Germany and France together with the bulk of all the clinical centers. We seem to be on track, and people are quite satisfied with where we are, but it\u2019s still early days in terms of any results. Perhaps I could also add we are planning a study which will be run in the U.S., not on IFU or an indications for use study, that is not an FDA approved study, but a study done with a prestigious university, well, let\u2019s say, I will give it out, Duke. And we are just dotting the Is and crossing Ts for Chris O'Connor, who is the Chair of Cardiology at Duke, not everything has been put to bed, but we are going to do a study which doesn\u2019t have mortality and morbidity as the endpoints, but rather six-minute walk quality of life, injection, fraction and so on, and we are actually quite excited by that, particularly based on some of the data that I\u2019ve referred to before coming out of Japan.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And we shouldn't expect any study this year?", "Peter C. Farrell", "And we think that\u2019s a study that, what you said Dan?", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "I'm sorry to interrupt. I just said that we shouldn't really expect any sort of incremental news this year from those studies.", "Peter C. Farrell", "No, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily. You will get a lot of \u2013 we expect a lot of good anecdotal reports, but nothing perspective, randomized controlled trial, peer review stuff if you like. But\u2026", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "All right.", "Peter C. Farrell", "But we will still be keeping you up to date with, met our analyses and smaller studies, if you like.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) And we have David Clair online with questions from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just, Peter, real quick, where do you think we are in the mix shift that's kind of been benefiting the flow generators? I mean how much more room for shifts at the higher-end devices do you think we have here?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, I think there is a fair amount of runway there David. I mean, it's sort of sticking your finger in the air to try to guess at it. But all I can say is the momentum is clearly there and you\u2019re not going to see very much usage of sleep labs of pressure setting. And the fact is that there are now enough peer reviewed papers in the literature comparing our AutoSetting devices with fixed CPAP. And in fact, if you look carefully at the data, the data are more in favor of APAP than they are in favor of fixed CPAP in terms of compliance and compliance in terms of the number of hours patient spends on the device.", "And it really makes no sense at all given those data and we\u2019ve sold \u2013 how many APAPs you think we've sold now? I know it's somewhere in the 2 million area. I mean it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t got pretty of data on these devices. And it makes no sense to go to a sleep lab to have the pressure set.", "I mean it\u2019s just you better off on an AutoSetting device, which is what we\u2019ve been saying for the last decade and the data are now there to prove it. And it\u2019s just an added inefficiency to go to a sleep lab to set a pressure. It\u2019s an added expense, it makes no sense to send the money and you\u2019re not getting any benefit, so we\u2019d say continuing. And particularly now with 75%, shortly 75% of commercially covered lives requiring pre-authorization, this horse has got plenty of puff.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then, for Brett, the tax rate guidance you provided and the gross margin guidance, I mean this quarter we were at the low on the tax side, and this is the second quarter in a row where gross margin has been north of that 61% midpoint. I mean, is this conservativism, or should we be expecting something in the back half of the year?", "Brett Sandercock", "Dan, I think as you can see, we've been sort of tracking at the high end of that range, and I suppose what I'd say is we're comfortable with that 60% to 62%. If you look at some of the product mix trends and they probably got some time to play out, then you could make the case that would be sort of the higher end of that range I suppose. But I would say, look, we're very comfortable with the range we\u2019ve given. But as you can see that, trend-wise we\u2019ve been at the higher end of that range.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "And the tax rate, Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, the tax is really sort of reflects \u2013 sort of full-year tax calculations around the 21% to 22%, I think way we will be for the fiscal around that area.", "Dan Hurren \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks guys. Congrats on a great quarter.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "We have Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse online with the question. Please go ahead.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Can you hear me?", "Peter C. Farrel", "Yes, Saul.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Peter, just picking you up on your comments about the data suggesting that CPAP, in fact, gives more compliance with the AutoSet training devices. Does that give you more confidence or any confidence that you might actually see a HCPCS code from Medicare for the APAP device?", "Peter C. Farrel", "Well, Saul, that's been in the hopper for so long, I mean it's almost since the birth of my first child. There've been so \u2013 CMS has just drawn a line in the sand on that. It would be nice if it were to happen. I just don\u2019t see it. I mean we went \u2013 in years past, we spent a lot of time providing data going back and explaining that this is a completely different animal because it gives roughly a 40% lull of pressure through the night. It tracks to what the patient actually needs in the upper airway. And therefore, QED it's a different animal. And they just haven\u2019t accepted the logic, so I don\u2019t expect that to change. It will be nice, but I just don\u2019t expect it to change.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thanks and just one last question is also for you, Peter. You had some good color on the adaptive fee or the AutoSet in Europe and Japan. I'm just wondering how is that adaptive fee going in the US, and is that a device where you really need to wait for that data from the SERVE-HF study trial to see meaningful sales there?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, Saul, we\u2019ve had data going back for almost a decade. And it's interesting when you look at the Japanese data and now it\u2019s not. If you are looking at the U.S. market, the Japanese data would be considered not tight enough, not near the protocols, not enough focus on randomized control trials and so forth. But we did sort of introduce the data from 25 centers in Japan to various people here. And I\u2019ve noted before that in Japan, cardiologists are actually doing the sleep studies themselves, I mean, it just so happens that the infrastructure there is conducive to that. But cardiologists are now putting patients onto adaptive servo ventilation treatment, the AutoSet CS without the patient having frank sleep disorder breathing.", "And the reason is that they maintain, well first of all, there\u2019s been nothing new under the sun and in the treatment of Congestive Heart Failure for decades or at least a couple of decades. And they know that the drying out of the lungs, drying out of the pleura area around the heart and the patients are just doing much better.", "So we believe that by getting the word out to people that this will have an impact on the sales. Also, the fact that the SERVE-HF trials what we\u2019ve seen particularly in Germany and France. What we\u2019ve seen is the fact that you have seen your heart failure specialists who are involved in the study and they are seeing positive results with the patients and so we\u2019re seeing an up tick in sales just by the fact that they are involving clinical trials.", "So you\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re not sitting back, waiting for a couple of years for a study to be completed. We\u2019re out there marketing the products and we\u2019re doing whatever we can within the law and within the regulatory environment to draw people\u2019s attention to have valid, we believe these data are.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "All right, thanks a lot Peter.", "Peter C. Farrel", "Thank you, Saul.", "Operator", "And we have Ben Andrew from William Blair on line with the question. Please go ahead.", "Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Good afternoon Peter.", "Peter C. Farrel", "Ben, how are you? ", "Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company", "I\u2019m well thanks. A question for you relative to mix as well as kind of customer behavior, what chunk of the time do you, number one, see people start out a patient on an auto and downgrade them eventually just to kind of switch out that cheaper device? I understand the clinical argument favored, but what percent of the time do you actually see that? And do you anticipate it getting a bit more difficult to make the economic arguments after we get implementation of Round 2?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Gosh, Ben, I just we have no visibility to those sort of data at all. But look \u2013 asking, I mean I am not aware of any large scale switching to \u2013 I mean, I know some of the hybrid DMEs will use AutoSetting and then switch the patients to cheaper device, but I'll throw that to Mick, do you have any comment?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yeah, Ben, that model may have applied five to 10 years ago with the ratio of an AutoSet to CPAP device was three to one. Now, you are talking more like a 1.25 to 1 and the delta, the price difference between the two, given the whole price compression that's been happening that 3% to 5% we talked over these last years is a minimal delta and $75 at least to get somebody to go to the patient's home and change the device and then you\u2019ve got to ensure the settings are right, and you can have complications and return visits.", "So the economic argument has driven to first time setup on APAC with all home sleep testing, but as we said in the preamble, some PSG testing is now looking at APAP applicator as well. And it\u2019s because it drives compliance, adherence, and keeps the patient on therapy and adapts the changing needs, breathing position, change in drug regimen, change in weight, many, many factors.", "So the mix shift from CPAP to APAP is industry wide and we believe that plays to our strengths where the Autoset is superior to its competitors in that category, and they really are very few players, I would say, looking at a VPAP or APAP initial period and then moving a patient down to basic CPAP, because of the long-term complications that they see in the changer and long-term upside basically in iPad keeping the patient on therapy and keeping the patient out of hospital for payer and high quality life of the patient and for HME keeping them coming back to order replenishment masks and accessories.", "Brett Sandercock", "So I guess you can summarize it then most things the inconvenience in with the current build between what does it cost you for an AutoSet and what it cost for a regular CPAP. But I mean it\u2019s kind of like wide boarder?", "Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then, Peter, have you guys had conversations with any of the larger homecare dealers or even the GPOs that address some of those groups relative to their approach after Round 2? And again, we know the experience in Round 1. We've heard you guys answer that question quite a few times. But what sort of differential do you expect when you increase it by a factor of 10, and what sort of conversations are you having? Thank you.", "Peter C. Farrel", "Well, I haven\u2019t had conversations. We all through that to Dave, Dave has been thinking about Round 2 quite a bit and maybe making comment. But Dave do you want to go first on that.", "David Pendarvis", "Sure, Ben, with regard to this use of AutoSet in connection with home sleep testing. I think a lot of that\u2019s occurring more on the commercial side rather than the Medicare side. For example all of the pre-authorization requirements that have been a large part of driving the shift towards more at home diagnosis is on the commercial side, not on the Medicare. So I\u2019m not sure any reimbursement changes on the therapy on the Medicare side really going to have a significant impact on this mix shift to auto.", "But certainly we have conversations with trade associations about what should we be doing as an industry together with converse or with CMS and others about affecting competitive bidding on the progress and how CMS is rolling it out and how the various bills that are in Congress are passing. So we\u2019re certainly talking with them about those types of issues. But I guess I would throw to make in terms of actual behavior. But I think our customers have gotten pretty comfortable overall with the idea that competitive bidding is coming in other MSAs that they didn't have it before. They don\u2019t expect any large change in terms of customer behavior either in terms of how they\u2019re guessing patient needs or equipment selection equipment selection or how they\u2019re focusing on the business generally.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "The only thing I add to Dave\u2019s comments, which is right on track is that, we\u2019re partnering with customers. We have discussions with them everyday about the processing environment Round 2 could not have been more publicized, probably, frankly more so in our investor and analyst community than it is with our commercial discussions that we have on a daily basis, because its part of the course. We know its happening. We know its going to hit July 1.", "Obviously they like on saying what the results were as they work through those results. But we\u2019ve been having discussions with customers over the last two years on this. I know you asked not to use that expense in those nine cities for the 91, but as the business guy been involved in this, we have experienced that those discussions happen.", "We partnered with the winners. So what we plan to do, when it goes 10x is partner with the winners again. And we have a pretty good idea of who that will be. The partners who think about long-term compliance and adherence and the people who will pick up those orphan patients from some of the small folks, who may go out of business, so we know the plan, we have got it ready to put in place and we partner with our customs on it.", "So to summarize, Dave\u2019s point, we are looking at the AAHomecare and the large industry groups, but we are also working with customers on the second front on a daily basis and we\u2019re ready to grow through competitive bidding on too.", "Benjamin Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Great, thanks guys. ", "Operator", "And we have Matthew Prior from Bank of America online with the question. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Prior \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Hi good morning guys. My two questions, are you guys focused on the contracts that you make? Mick, I guess compared to bidding Round 2, there\u2019s been several delays. Can you give us any kind of thoughts you have around timing for the announcement of that?", "And just I\u2019m really interested in the pricing dynamics between CPAP and APAP given some manufacturers are pushing out lower pricing on CPAPs, you\u2019re focusing on APAPs, HST forces the APAP to switch, and I guess I\u2019m concerned somewhat that you could see more pricing aggression in CPAP that could drag down APAP as they fit under the same code?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yeah, although I mean they are both on the E0601 code and we talk about that earlier, that\u2019s not going to change. We tried that five times. But the mix shift to APAP will continue. There will continue to be price pressure on both CPAP and APAP in a competitive market that what\u2019s happens.", "Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any special intel as to why Washington is moving slowly, other than if the government and they\u2019ve got 10 times the number of data coming through and probably the payment wasn\u2019t much bigger than Round 1 looking at it. So we don\u2019t have a date as to when that\u2019s going to come. But we\u2019re reasonably confident in our range of expectations as to what the reductions will be based up on Round 1 and some good surveys have been done across the group. But we\u2019ll see the data when we come to it.", "In terms of low-cost players in the CPAP space and its impact on APAP, there is certainly an impact there. But if you don\u2019t have an APAP, you can\u2019t compete in the category of the market requires an APAP. So it\u2019s really two or three horse race, maybe four in that space. But it\u2019s a category that we plan to grow, and we have the best algorithms, and we\u2019ve done well so far. Connie, I don't know if you've any further intel into what\u2019s happening with CMS on that front?", "Constance Bienfait", "As Mick said, we expect that any day now as it\u2019s later than fall. So we\u2019re hearing noises that maybe next week. But we don\u2019t know anything more than the rest of you.", "Matthew Prior \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, Thanks. That's good to hear to the extent they're keeping it all under wraps. But I guess my second question just focusing on that issue of compliance and more so informatics. Can you talk to what percentage now of the second and third tier DMEs are running a compliance system like EasyCare Online, and in your discussions with them in the late uptick competitive bidding? Do you think that's going to be a market share winner for ResMed or the other players?", "Peter C. Farrell", "I\u2019ll hand the second part of this question on to Don Darkin, because his team put together the healthcare informatics play EasyCare Online, which is penetrating across the group, but in terms of looking at the T\u2019s of HMEs in the U.S. market particularly, but across the America as the EasyCare Online was introduced, we had districts customers who have been on this platform for five to six years, who switched over within months, some of them weeks on to EasyCare Online.", "The value proposition of EasyCare Online of having data available immediately in a very sort of outside Apple like user friendly iTunes like user friendly cloud environment has been incredibly powerful for not only the providers, the adjuvant providers, but really importantly the physicians who write the prescriptions and have access to those data.", "And in future, to our customers\u2019 customers, for the providers to provide those data to payers and even in the future to patients as well, but specifically two questions, second and third tier, sort of large regional in the mom and pops really have started to adopt EasyCare Online because it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s available, and more and more prescriptions for connected S9 devices with wireless capability are coming to market, but those things been costliest sort of S curve adoption in EasyCare Online. I don\u2019t know Don, if you have any further comments on Hi or EasyCare Online?", "Don Darkin", "Yeah, thanks Pete. Matt, we are pretty impressed with the uptake. In fact, it has gone much quicker than we expected, and it's pretty much of sort of provided across all the DME groups. What we are seeing now is a slight connection between the uptick on the data for EasyCare Online and a push in the growth as well in that space. So we\u2019re quite pleased with that position.", "And I\u2019m expecting with a small \u2013 we\u2019ve got a bunch of pending releases within that space both with EasyCare and some other software that we would continue to see a pretty big up tick in the adoption of that which also actually helps us with moving towards the APAP space as well for the data, so pretty positive.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And Matt just to add a bit more flavor you know on the issue of price pressures and cheaper products being available, if these guys can offer interim solutions and the robustness of the data management and the algorithms, I mean we\u2019re just not seeing \u2013 look, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re complacent, that\u2019s the last thing we are, but we just don\u2019t see this as being a big deal.", "Constance Bienfait", "One other quick note on the timing Matt, the CMS has planned a bunch of webinars for the bidders and other constituencies in February. So if the numbers don\u2019t come out soon, they\u2019re going to have to push back the schedule for the whole year quite a bit.", "Matthew Prior \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "And we have Bruce Du from CDN on line with question. Please go ahead.", "Bruce Du from \u2013 CDN", "Thanks, guys for taking my question. Just in terms of the masked replenishment, I know you've given some update before, but you don't have sort of great detail in terms of end-user replacements. But can I ask in terms of the sort of US mass replenishment rates, what do you think the market is at currently and in particular whether or not you've come to see sort of more, some of the small to midsize DMEs really starting to push the replenishment story?", "Unidentified Company Representative ", "Well, there is no question that people are saying it as an opportunity and the more compliance improves and we have seen compliance improving effect talking to a guy who runs a small service company in Atlanta this morning and he surprised me by saying that they compliances 90%. So if you are getting that sort of compliance, you are going to obviously see impact on replenishment. ", "And if you get right back to when CMS changes the rules and you got a share 30 days consistent years within 90 days period of a patient put on CPAP, then you are forced to get into the health informatics or at least track what\u2019s happening and that also cause people to improve their compliance. So that also has a very positive impact on replenishment, but the latest data I saw were it\u2019s still of the order, in fact a little less than two masks, two cushions per patient per year, but I will turn to Mick for further comments. ", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yeah Bruce and actually this dives back into Matt\u2019s question about the different tiers of HMEs right, so the large nationals, to the quantification, the large nationals have all adopted replenishment and I would say are executing pretty well on the current sleep test and we are working and partnering with them on that. The large regions, more than 50% of doctors, but there is still a lot of runway left on that large regional space.", "The mom and pops very much under penetrated in this space and we through EasyCare Online, that\u2019s where it ties into Matt\u2019s question, through EasyCare Online penetrating its way into that that sort of mom and pop and small regional space will give them the facility and capability and some other software elements that don\u2019t into that that\u2019s linked to our Umbian acquisition and usually platform is that start to become available throughout the HME space can give far more capability for this masked replenishment to take off.", "So if reimbursement allows 12 cushions per patient per year and we are solved two cushions per patients per year, and we are sub two cushions per patient. You can see there is a lot left on the runway and mask systems is more penetrated, but that cushions area, there is a lot of work to drive, no matter what happens on the reimbursement front.", "So it\u2019s a balance across that and we are looking at how we empower the whole spectrum of our HME customer group across the small, medium and large segments and we have a team that is dedicated and focused to doing a consultant sales team that focus on this phase. So we are not just talking about it, we are taking action. ", "Bruce Du from \u2013 CDN", "Great. And just my second one was just in relation to your early comments in terms of potentially some masks product launches towards the end of this calendar year. Just I guess, the recent product launches you've seen from your competitors, I guess what are you seeing in terms of the feedback and how they're doing in terms of the nasal pillow category and also the full face mask category with some of those guys have launched? What are you seeing from the competitor products thus far?", "Peter C. Farrel", "Well, you probably saw one of the analyst reports was that in the last day or so, comparing the quality of the masks and across the Board, whether it\u2019s full face or whether it\u2019s nasal pillows or the nasal masks and Mirage effects, we are just significantly above the others in terms of patients and physician acceptance. So our current offerings are actually pretty damn good, but you can always improve and Don and I were chatting just before Christmas or around Christmas while I was in Sydney and Don was showing me through the new masks in the hopper and they are just hugely impressive, but even without talking about JFU I think what we\u2019ve got now is pretty good, you will in the future, we are not doing that, we continue to make improvements. ", "Now when others release masks typically what we get at is, we got go hope, people are going to try them, but so the Respironics offerings and they got offerings across those three spaces, full face and pillows and nasal.  But we are still seeing better acceptance of our comp products and we expect that to continue. So you\u2019ve got a blip, people try stuff, but now we are seeing it reverse. ", "Bruce Du from \u2013 CDN", "Great thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ve Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities online with questions. Please go ahead. ", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "Thanks. I have trouble pronouncing it, too, sometimes. I guess, first of all, I guess I'm just curious there has been a lot of focus on the mix shift that you are clearly benefiting from with all the higher end products, but you know to the degree you're able or willing to answer it, I'm curious what you think the actual volume growth is in the market, both US and outside the US? Because, you know, the checks that I've been doing indicates that volume growth is actually pretty low, and obviously with these mix shifts, maybe you don't need a lot of volume growth, but I just want to see if I'm missing something, or does that seem reasonable?", "Peter C. Farrel", "Well, in terms of growth rates, we haven\u2019t changed in the last couple of quarters, based on the information that\u2019s coming from a variety of sources to us. So European growth is somewhere in the vicinity of 4% to 6%, 6% to 8% in the U.S. and maybe little nudged up a little higher in Asia/Pac, 8% to 10% in terms of the overall market growth in terms of the volume of devices.", "Now in terms of our specific business, no question that the benefit of HSTs to AutoSet is a huge plus, and as you know and we mentioned in the press release, all our products are now in the S9 platform, that is we\u2019ve seen this has had an extraordinary positive effect on the CPAP ST-A, but also on the adaptive servo ventilators, I mean we can bear in mind, there we went from an S7, which is almost like a car battery by comparison to this much more user-friendly lighter.", "There were some changes in algorithm as well, we have gone to order rate, but so we have made improvements in both the size and to lesser extent the algorithms. And we're seeing if you like our Bi-Level business is coming back to where we believe it should be. And Michael, do you have any thing to add to that?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yeah, hi, Mick and we saw your report that came out. I think one thing that when you look at the volumes and what the growth rate is and when we say the revenue growth rate in the Americas in 6% to 8%. It maybe that the volumes are slightly higher than that, I mean we have got mix shift as a positive, but then you\u2019ve got ASP declines in the 5% range that is a negative factor on that as well. We haven\u2019t talked publicly about volume numbers within devices, because we\u2019re the only public company that goes into this space, and whatever information we use is heard by our competitors, but we don\u2019t get the flip side of that.", "But I think one area that maybe worthwhile adding to your research area is the leakage that happens throughout the pipeline when a patient goes into the pipeline. And patients sometimes when they get the referral onto PSG or HST leak out the system. Our research has shown when you have a choice between home sleep testing, particularly in PSG and even just offering the HST. You get less patients leaking out of the system.", "So that would argue that even without the macroeconomic environment improving, which we think it probably is, you have that chance for lower leakage has HST goes from 12% a year ago to 25% this last calendar year to our projections are that is 35%, 45%, even some optimists at 50% by the end of this calendar year. So that leakage rate, we expect to reduce as home sleep testing comes to market. So that\u2019s just another parts put in the equation of patient flow volumes.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "All right, I guess I\u2019m still a little confused just because it sounds like now you\u2019re seeing that the pricing, obviously peer price has been down. But I assume mix was more than offsetting that, maybe the difference is you\u2019re talking about the market more broadly, instead of ResMed specifically. But all right, so I guess my other question is just on Singapore. What portion of your production is going through Singapore at this point, and how much higher do you think that can go?", "Peter C. Farrel", "Well, we\u2019re north of 15%. We\u2019re heading to 75% and I don\u2019t know Rob, do you want to make a comment on that?", "Robert Douglas", "Yes Mike, it just stays as part of the long-term plan. We are putting growth in our production into Singapore, we're holding other facility steady. What will happen is we'll hit some capacity living in Singapore and then evaluate our next steps. But it\u2019s clear to say, that could easily go to 75%, but it will happen steadily and incrementally. We are also running production in Malaysia of headgear that was the result of an earlier acquisition of some business, so that\u2019s picking up that number a bit as well and our supply teams continuing to work on that strategy but in our growing business we can do this in a very organized way.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "And a little bit of advertizing here for Singapore, last month I was down there and had the pleasure meeting with the economic development board at least their healthcare sector people. And when the Singapore government talks about business and government and academe working together they actually walk to talk and then nice to the other countries where we\u2019re doing business, the United States or Australia they has done walk to talk, it\u2019s more of an anti business environment there like, it can be with taxes or unionization of whatever it is but the Singaporean government, they\u2019re just a pleasure, an absolute pleasure to work with ", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities", "All right, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "And we have David Low from Deutsche Bank online with a question, please go ahead  ", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank very much. Just a question on, we heard a couple of stories that Respironics have experimented with a direct to consumer model. Just wondering what ResMed\u2019s view is of that and whether you\u2019ve benefited from any backlash from the, say the Respironics side pushback ", "Unidentified Company Representative ", "Well you know if you go back a couple of years ago maybe three or four years ago, Philips actually flagged if they were looking into direct-to-consumer, so we weren\u2019t surprised by this statement to be honest. And Kroger is probably not a bad month to go where we have got 2000 outlets. But look I have heard a couple of stories that, there was one of the big DMEs and I listen you guys and they immediately withdrew, but then we heard that they only withdrew from the stores which were advertised, and it was still ongoing, but, Mick, you are closer to this than I am.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Hey, look, I think it\u2019s a great question about Philips. Basically, for those on the call who may not know, Philips worked on a pilot experiment with supermarket/pharmacy chain called Kroger's, and they\u2019ve sent a letter to the industry about this, I am not breaching anything to this, they have made public. Their approach and experimentation with a pilot trial with a mass retail channel was provocative in a market.", "The immediate question from customers to us was, well, are you guys going to follow and we said no and here is why, we think it\u2019s all about compliance and adherence, and ensuring that patient gets the best setup and the best chance to stick to seek that therapy. And that conversation with a physician, respiratory therapists, or some specialists in the space upfront talking about the comorbidities, heart failure, heart attack, hypertension, diabetes, morbid obesity upfront drives adherence. And the other part of it is just simple business models and what\u2019s won.", "When you look at brick and mortar book stores, they are going out of business, the Amazon. So why would a patient who is compliant and happy with their mask want to pickup a cushion at Kroger's when they include if let\u2019s say, the HME had setup a good replenishment program and you could just click 1 on your phone or press Yes on a text or click on an iPhone app that maybe the HME had provided or through EasyCare Online or I\u2019m getting it provided for the patient.", "So we think the best business model will win is the one that drives best compliance and adherence, showing the return on care and that is better business model HMEs and it\u2019s a wake-up call for HMEs. So if you don\u2019t service the patients with cash model options, right, where it\u2019s beyond reimbursement high deductible health plans, that someone else will fill that need.", "So there wasn\u2019t a huge backlash in the quarter. Our growth numbers were based on solid performance. But it was an interesting experiment and it helped us create some conversations with our HMEs about reimbursement, cash business and replenishment that we think it was in line with our conversations before and was a catalyst for further discussions about maybe penetrating those large regionals and large mom and pops as to and even the small guys about how to drive replenishment, because if you don\u2019t do it, someone else will. That was a sort of experiment and summary from outside.", "Peter C. Farrel", "And if you\u2019re looking at direct to consumer, I mean one thing you could think more about is that to be more along of lines of a diagnostic system, in other words, something alerting to you that you have poor sleep quality or whatever and that\u2019s along the lines of sort of buying something in an Apple store or getting something from Omron measuring the wellness in this wellness category and then directing you to go to a sleep level, go to a sleep position or whatever.", "And to Mick\u2019s point, if you don\u2019t get compliance, we all lose. And we\u2019re, frankly, pretty delighted with what we\u2019re hearing about compliance now, and surprisingly the government actually did something sensibly. So we\u2019re even more surprised at that. But the CMS, the 90-day, 30-day continuous user steam has been a positive of the marketplace. ", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. That's very helpful actually just on that same theme. Peter, you mentioned in France a change in requirements on telemonitoring. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what's exactly going on there, please?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, we are using the check book to force people to do data monitoring. You are going to get paid less if your device doesn\u2019t provide the appropriate telemonitoring, but Rob maybe you can say a few words about that. But we consider \u2013 we are on lovely, I mean really strong position with EasyCare Online and U-Sleep from Umbian and so on, but Rob do you want to add some more flavor?", "Robert Douglas", "Yeah, I\u2019d say the French bodies that are managing it, it really gets the economic case about sleep apnea and they want to make it even more efficient to treating, so there's been a discussion going on for about a year to implement this requirement for wireless monitoring effect of all patients and its been a tough discussion throughout the year, but its now reached a position where we know what to do. ", "We have actually got our EasyCare Online system running in France and working well and we\u2019re going to provide the best online monitoring and the most efficient online monitoring service in France. It\u2019s going to be a very good solution that we will be providing there and the French authorities want to see this start real soon, and around the middle of the year, they will be expecting all new patients to be wirelessly monitored to seek development. ", "Peter C. Farrell", "And there is an economic incentive for people to do it for the healthcare providers, because they get paid more or they paid less if they don\u2019t provide this. And so well actually, they will go out of business ", "Robert Douglas", "", "The reimbursement effectively changes midyear. You get paid less if you\u2019re not offering data monitoring", "Peter C. Farrell", "Well, the French reimbursement model, is sort of a fixed regular weekly fee, and that has got a plan for where that goes. And over time, like all issues in business, gradually decreases. But the rates, it won't decrease if you're on the telemonitoring. So it\u2019s an effective price differential coming in there for that.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Thank you, Adrean. Yeah, thanks everybody for listening and I think we will call it quit. And except to say that another great quarter from our team and I want to congratulate all ResMed employees for doing just an absolutely splendid job once again for our 72 record quarter; that\u2019s now 18 years, I sound like a broken record. So it\u2019s a pretty good record, which we are extremely proud of. So thanks to the guys and the team.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Trish, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.", "Constance C. Bienfait", "Thank you, Trish, and thank you all for joining us today.", "The company has asked me to address certain matters. First, ResMed does not authorize the recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose.", "Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, new product launches or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you may access through the company's website at www.resmed.com.", "[Operator Instructions] Speaking on the call today are Peter Farrell, Executive Chairman; Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Farrell. Peter, please go ahead.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Okay. Thank you, Connie, and thanks to everyone for joining us. After this call, I'll turn over responsibility for the handling of future quarterly earnings calls to Mick, who the board appointed as CEO, which most of you would have come across last month.", "And as an aside, let me point out that we had a 2-year search, which the board conducted under the auspices of Spencer Stuart, and we examined both internal and external candidates. And the decision was made, as I said, last month. So I'll review the quarter, and then Mick, who's currently in London, will join the call and make some brief remarks before we hand over the call to Brett Sandercock to go through the numbers in more detail.", "So first, the financial summary. As you would have seen from the press release, we finished another solid quarter. This represents the 73rd consecutive quarter in which we've grown the top line and obviously, we're extremely pleased about that. Global revenue in the third quarter grew 10%, both actual and constant currency numbers to $334 million. Revenue in the Americas grew 13% year-over-year to $215 million, and ROW revenue increased 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. And that also was in both actual and constant currency terms, and that was to $168 million.", "We believe that these results were from as a result of both superior product quality and full solution offerings. And these 2 aspects continue to drive our growth.", "Net income for the quarter increased 31% to $85 million while GAAP EPS increased 32% to $0.58 per share for the quarter. Excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, EPS was a record $0.59, which showed excellent operating performance.", "The global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by our high-end devices with strong sales of AutoSet, bilevels and adaptive servo-ventilation, as well as in Respiratory Care with the Stellar. We believe we continue to take share in the AutoSet space, and we are also gaining share back in bilevels. In short, our respiratory products are being well-received.", "And there is plenty of room for us to continue to grow in all these areas. For example, in the Americas, where Flow Generator sales were particularly strong this quarter, we had the S9 AutoSet, bilevels and VPAP Adapt, which of course is our adaptive servo-ventilator in the U.S., all did particularly well. And we attribute a lot of the share gains and mix shift to both the positive responses to EasyCare Online and to increases in home sleep testing, which I will discuss in a little more detail.", "Turning to the rest of the world. There is still a lot of uncertainty in Europe. However, we were gratified with the results in both the U.K. and Germany. So despite the challenging economic climate throughout Europe, as well as fiscal constraints, the focus is still on treatment that keeps patients out of hospital and healthy. AutoSet CS, again our ASV offering in Europe, VPAP ST and Stellar products did well again this quarter in most parts of Europe.", "The Asia-Pacific region also had a solid quarter, with strong sales in Japan and India, although as we've explained on a number of occasions, Japan sales are inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. And in this particular quarter, Japan was a little soft though, but not unexpected. Japan ended this fiscal year end, and these distractions that is Teijin, ended their fiscal year on March 31. And those distractions tend to affect their sales during this quarter. And as I said, they're a little softer but not unexpected.", "As I mentioned, EasyCare Online, the compliance management system, continues to be well-received. And we are seeing solid uptake from both existing, as well as new accounts. And the EasyCare Online, I should point out, is also now available for bilevels.", "In this challenging environment, where there are changes in government reimbursement, coupled with mandates to bring down the cost of health care, products and programs, which provide superior therapy and better compliance, what bring the most value across the board to patients, customers and payers.", "Now with respect to interfaces, masks, our growth moderated due to -- and I think a number of you referred to this new entrance into the marketplace. However, Mask parts and accessories did very well in all geographies. But complete Mask systems sales were, in fact, a little softer. Both Philips and F&P have 2 new masks, as most people are aware. And as expected, they are being trialed by various customers. This is not a new experience for us. But as you know, we've been experiencing particularly good performance and market share gains in all of our Mask categories for quite some time. So things do tend to change.", "But more recently, the new competitive offerings, as I've already mentioned, are being tried by some of our customers. We are of a view, however, that these new entrants are not nearly as good as ours, but they are gaining traction as HMEs are willing to, as I said, try them.", "But perhaps equally importantly, or arguably more importantly, we faced a tough comparison to last year's third quarter's -- last year's third quarter, where growth in the Mask category in the Americas was 21%, and globally, it was 16%. So in short, a pretty big mountain to climb.", "However, as always, we plan to stay ahead of the game by constantly innovating. We provide -- we are going to provide, in the very near future, mask products that are smaller, quieter and more comfortable, and which we believe will keep us well ahead of the game.", "Our product pipeline is actually quite full, and we are releasing 2 considerably improved mask products this quarter with more to come during the remainder of fiscal 2014. In fact, we are extremely optimistic about these new interface innovations.", "Now coming back to home sleep testing. The number of commercially covered adult lives requiring pre-authorization for PSG continues to roll out, steering providers and patients towards HST. It is now well over 50% of covered lives and heading north. We estimate that at the -- or we estimate that at the end of calendar 2012, approximately 25% of all tests were HST, and we believe -- or our numbers are showing that this will be around about 40% at the end of our fiscal year June 30.", "We continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST, averaging approximately 38% during the last 12 months, with a rise to around 47% in January in response, again, to pre-authorization. We are also participating in primary care physician awareness initiatives as HST continues to advance. In fact, PCPs are becoming more involved with the diagnosis and management of the sleep apnea patient and are also starting to drive momentum in the whole of the sleep business.", "So sleep market is not just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing, it is very much about forming partnerships with both customers and payers. A combination of our range of high-quality Flow Generators, the most comfortable and effective masks and accessories and easy to access robust data through the EasyCare Online, makes us an excellent value proposition.", "Not only do we have a robust pipeline of new masks, we have future technology innovations planned for both sleep and Respiratory Care. In short, we are at the forefront as leaders in innovation in the sleep space, and we have every intention to continue to bring to market the best possible solutions for sleep-disordered breathing.", "Finally, as I have said before, given recent data, which suggest that SDB, sleep-disordered breathing, affects approximately 25% of the adult population at some level and that the treatment -- the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, firstly, improves quality of life; secondly, slows co-morbid disease progression; and finally, reduces health care costs. It is, as I have said before, the holy grail of health care delivery.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Mick. Are you ready to make some comments, Mick?", "Michael J. Farrell", "I am. And thank you, and hello from London. This is a really exciting time for our team here at ResMed and not just because we had a Q3 revenue of $384 million, which represented 10% top line growth and 31% net income growth. However, with the fast growth of the global health care spend and its growing share of the GDP burdening many major global economies, both governments, as well as private payers are looking for answers to reduce the cost of the health care and to improve patient outcomes.", "We believe that at ResMed, we have the answer to these questions in the fields of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD and in other cardiorespiratory areas, particularly heart failure. I'd like to take just a couple of minutes to discuss 3 major growth horizons that we see in our future here at ResMed.", "The first growth horizon for ResMed is in our core SDB business. In the last 12 months alone, we have impacted many millions of lives in this space, resulting in around $1.5 billion in revenue. We will continue to grow the number of lives we impact each year along with our revenue. We are the global SDB market leader. We've talked before about SDB as a solid growing market and one that is incredibly underpenetrated.", "At most, it's 5% to 15% penetrated, meaning that 85% to 95% of the opportunity in our core business is still in front of us. As the global SDB market leader, we're in a great position to drive new market penetration and new market growth, geographically and to other co-morbidities, as you just heard.", "We've said it before. Our biggest competitor is not one of the other SDB manufacturers. It's a lack of education and awareness of the signs and symptoms of SDB, as well as the ability for physicians, particularly PCPs, to have practical medical action pathways. We're investing in changing that and ensuring that we have sustained, strong growth in our core SDB market.", "The second growth horizon for ResMed is our Respiratory Care business. This fast-growing business includes diseases such as COPD, as I mentioned before; neuromuscular diseases, such as ALS also called Lou Gehrig's disease.", "This Respiratory Care opportunity includes hospital and homecare ventilation, as well as hospital and homecare humidification. We have a leadership position in Western Europe with homecare ventilation. However, in the U.S. market, we have significant room for share growth. Combining Respiratory Care opportunities in the U.S. with those significant ones in Asia-Pacific, as well as Latin America, we have revenue growth potential in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. And there are many, many millions of patients with COPD and neuromuscular disease whose lives can be significantly changed with innovative ResMed technology.", "In that vein, we've just announced today, as you saw another press release in these last 24 hours, that we are launching the first and only bilevel device cleared by the FDA specifically for the treatment of COPD, one of the top 5 killers in the Western world. COPD sufferers now have a weapon in their fight to stay out of hospital. One of the biggest challenges for COPD patients, as well as their payers and physicians and for the health care providers that we serve, is to keep these patients from returning to the hospital after a COPD exacerbation event.", "More than 1 in 5 COPD patients are rehospitalized within 30 days. VPAP COPD has all the features of our higher-end noninvasive ventilation devices, including access to our cloud-based software system, EasyCare Online. EasyCare gives physicians, payers and HMEs the opportunity to monitor COPD patients, as well as our core SDB patients, it's the same platform, and intervene if there's a problem and potentially reduce cost and reduce rehospitalizations.", "Our third growth horizon is in the field of cardiorespiratory disease, but specifically cardiology and even more specifically, heart failure. As many of you know, we're running a large multinational randomized controlled trial or RCT in the heart failure space called SERVE-HF. SERVE as in a tennis serve and HF for heart failure. SERVE-HF is evaluating approximately 1,300 patients and is wrapping up enrollment over the coming weeks and months.", "In this 2-year follow-up study, we are looking at 2 primary outcomes: mortality and morbidity. We're cautiously optimistic that the data from SERVE-HF are going to show that ResMed's proprietary technology can save both lives and money, so to reduce the mortality and to reduce the morbidity. This is an enormous opportunity in the market space where heart failure and SDB intersect.", "At ResMed, we believe we have the best products, the best team and the winning strategy. We care about the health and the quality of life of our patients. We care about disease prevention. We care about improving outcomes, and we care about improving the economics of our somewhat broken health care systems. We are more excited than we have ever been that despite the challenges of current health care market dynamics, we at ResMed have the capabilities and the product pipeline to really make a difference.", "You'll hear me echoing many of the same things you've heard from Peter Farrell over the last couple of decades: our belief in ResMed's people, our world-leading product quality, our laser-like focus on innovation as well as solid science and clinical validation. Most important though is our shared vision for these 3 growth markets. We are proud to be leaders in SDB. And as you heard earlier, there is still so much room for growth in that space.", "I'm really looking forward to partnering in the office of the CEO with Rob Douglas, our COO, and with the rest of our CEO operations team, as well as with the almost 4,000 strong ResMed global team as we continue to drive increased value for our shareholders.", "The bottom line is that we have defined business plans, specific identified investments and key ResMed business leaders who are accountable for driving success in these 3 growth horizons I've talked about: SDB, Respiratory Care and cardiology.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to Brett, who's in Sydney, to review Q3 in more detail. Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "All right. Thanks, Mick. As we mentioned, revenue for the March quarter was $383.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter and also 10% in constant currency terms. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.1 million, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $84.9 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 32% over the prior year quarter.", "Gross margin for the March quarter was 62.4%, up sequentially from Q2 FY '13. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product and geographic mix and manufacturing and logistics improvements. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin for the balance of fiscal year 2013 to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates.", "We continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures. SG&A expenses for the quarter were $109.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 8%, and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 28.6% compared to the year ago figure of 29.2%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for the balance of fiscal year 2013.", "R&D expenses for the quarter was $31.2 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 11%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8.1%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues to be around 8% for the balance of fiscal year 2013, reflecting ongoing investment in our product pipeline.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 23.1%. The lower tax rate reflects the benefit of lower effective tax rates in our Singapore and Australian operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 will be in the vicinity of 21%.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $215.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $168.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking our revenue between product segments. In the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $95.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $119.8 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter.", "For revenue outside the Americas, Flow Generator sales were $114.6 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, also an increase of 9%. Masks and other sales were $53.8 million, consistent with the prior year quarter.", "Globally in constant currency terms, Flow Generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 5%. Cash flow from operations was $107 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $19.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $20.7 million.", "Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $67.3 million. For the first 9 months of fiscal year 2013, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for consideration of $115.3 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 6.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.", "During the final quarter of fiscal year 2013, we intend to purchase at least 1 million shares under our share buyback program. In addition to our share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $672 million. And at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion, and net equity was $1.8 billion.", "I'll now hand the call back to our operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I guess first one for me just on competitive bidding. Just wondering if you can give us some color on conversations you've had with BMEs following the rate announcements?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, David. That's a great question, and I'll probably hand over to Jim Hollingshead, the president of our Americas group to talk in more detail about the conversations as he took over the Americas during the last quarter. But to lead out on it, competitive bidding conversations have been ongoing with our customers over the last 2 years through round one that we're 2 years into and ended the conversations on, and into round 2, which as you said, the announcements came about around the -- with an apples-to-apples number, low 40% reduction versus sort of expectations in the 30s. We've had lots of conversations with our customers over these last 90 days as we have over the last 2 years, and the conversations really aren't any different than they were before, which is how do we work together, how do we find ways to get efficiencies out of the system that we can link up together to take cost out of the system, to link with our electronic data interfaces, our EDI, to get drop-ship to inventory sites, to work together to understand how we can help Medicare understand the return on investment from treating -- diagnosing and treating sleep-disordered breathing patients. And of course, the topic of price comes up, but that comes up in every discussion with our partners. To frame this, as we always do on this call, and many of the analysts who are listening to this call around the mathematics on this, and we're talking about 20% to 25% of our Americas payers are included in competitive bidding. So I guess somewhere between 10% and 12% of our global revenue could potentially be impacted by this. So there's a lot of other elements that go into the price discussion for the other 80% to 90% of the business. But Jim, do you have any further detail that you might want to share with David with regard to conversations about competitive bidding round 2?", "James Hollingshead", "Sure, Mick. Thanks very much for the question, David. I don't have a lot to add to what Mick said. We were obviously talking to our customers about the issue of competitive bidding round 2 frequently, and nobody's happy with the extent to which reimbursements have been cut. And it does represent a cut in reimbursement portion of their business, but I do think it's fair to say that the more sophisticated HMEs out in the market understand that -- understand a couple of things. The first thing they understand is that there's a volume opportunity if they want contracts. The second thing they understand is what they need to do is drive efficiencies into their business. And so that tends to be the kind of conversation we're having with customers, is how we can help them. As Mick alluded to, how we can help them by providing solutions and services so that they can run more efficiently.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick one on the new Mask launches that you've talked about briefly on the call. Do you think that these -- do these address the Philips and Fisher & Paykel products that took a little bit of share in the quarter? And any additional details on -- are they nasal pillow, nasal, fullface, anything you want to share there?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So, David, that's a great question and one that the Philips and F&P and other competitors who are listening to this conference call would love to hear lots of details on. I don't think we're going give a lot of detail on that. I think we've said a lot in that our pipeline is very solid. We plan to launch 2 masks in this quarter, and there's a lot more in the pipeline to come. I'll hand over to Don Darkin maybe to give a little bit of color as to how our FX Series is holding up: Our Mirage FX, Quattro FX. These masks -- and Swift FX, have had incredible success for a sustained period of time, and we know that the market is sampling some of the competitive masks from our 2 major competitors. And we think that's a healthy competitive environment to have in the market. We're very proud of our #1 patient-preferred market position in the mask space, and we plan to defend it by innovating further and getting further ahead of where we were, which was in the lead. But, Don, any further color that you might want to provide David on the masks?", "Donald Darkin", "Thanks, Mick. David, we're pretty confident that what's coming out in the next few months is going to be more than adequate to cover what we need. I think more importantly, the actual pipeline itself over the next months, you're going to see pretty much what we've been planning on for some time now. And I think the competitive position for us will be more than adequate as we go forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Two questions, if I might. First, on the COPD opportunity, how should we think about that in terms of revenue generation, for you all, in terms of magnitude and time frame?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Great question, Ben. And we have a large focus on COPD, and I'm going to hand this question for further detail on to Geoff Neilson, who's the President of our Respiratory Care group. But just to lead out there, the COPD market opportunity is huge. It's the top 5 killer in the Western world. It actually I think just jumped up to #3, ahead of stroke, which dropped down to #4 in terms of how many people it kills in the Western world. But apart from that, it also costs the system a heck of a lot of money. And that rehospitalization, as many of you know, particularly in the U.S. market, there are serious penalties to hospitals for within 30-day rehospitalization events. We think we can help the hospitals, but also really help the patients and physicians who have trouble with these exacerbated events with our VPAP COPD product. And the market opportunity is in the triple digits, but I will hand over to Geoff to provide some more color for you there, Ben.", "Geoff Neilson", "Ben, thanks for the question. I think if you look at the number of COPD exacerbations, which are hospitalized every year, there is getting close to 100 million -- sorry, 1 million patients every year hospitalized for COPD. Around 400,000 of these are hypercapnia COPD patients, which means that they'd be suitable for NIV treatment post discharge. Unfortunately, because of the qualification criteria here in the U.S., not all of them can be qualified for NIV therapy. So we were estimating the market given the current qualification criteria in reimbursement to be in the order of $100 million annually in the U.S. So that's -- and this product, it is really focused at what the requirement is in the U.S. As far as the time frame goes, obviously, we've got to change some practices in terms of discharge, prescribing behavior. These patients can qualify direct from the hospital rather than going to the sleep lab, and so that's not a short-term activity and we do have a sales force in the ground that we're building up who's calling on the hospitals and the discharge planners with the discharge guidelines and education material to try and change that. But it's going to be a multi-year activity to build up our fair share of that $100 million market.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And so from a revenue per patient opportunity, is it a typical pricing for the VPAP plus kind of a mass replenishment model or is there a different reimbursement model that allows different pricing?", "Geoff Neilson", "No. So this is going to be reimbursed under EO 470, which is a standard bilevel without a backup rate pricing. So this device is specifically designed to meet the FDA criteria for respiratory insufficiency device, which as the device has indicated, for COPD. But for the first time, it's possible to prescribe on label bilevel device for respiratory insufficiency and do that straight from the hospital. So it's going to be a premium to your existing bilevel devices, but it's not going to be priced at a ventilator-type pricing.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And last question as I have other track I want to go on but how high is the bar for another company to get a similar indication?", "Geoff Neilson", "I think we could expect to get our fair market share of this. Clearly, it's possible for other companies to get these indications, and we've optimized our product specifically around treatment for COPD. But it's not impossible for others to do the same thing in time.", "Michael J. Farrell", "What I'd add on to that, Ben, is that there's some level of sustained competitive advantage from the VPAP COPD not necessarily just in the device, but also in -- as you saw in the press release and you heard in the remarks we just made, it's linked to EasyCare Online. Having a cloud-based compliance and adherence in management system that already has its market share growing in the core SDB space linking the VPAP COPD, not only with the whole S9 platforms. So all the humidifiers, tubing connectivity but also the cloud-based connectivity is there. We think that can provide some level of sustained competitive advantage. And as Geoff said, we expect to get more than our fair share of this large opportunity in COPD.", "Geoff Neilson", "If I can just add to what Mick said. So many of these patients are on oxygen with our new ClimateLine Oxy tubing, and we allow oxygen to be fed in there. That means we're optimizing humidification and therefore, comfort for these patients, which means that we enhance compliance. And that also means that we're reducing exacerbations and reducing rehospitalizations.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And maybe you can add a little bit more, Geoff, in the sense that we've also altered some of the characteristics for inhaling and exhaling. We won't go into details there, but we've really optimized the way the unit functions.", "Geoff Neilson", "Yes. So we've optimize the parameters and so on in the device, specifically for COPD, to make it easy to set it up because we want this to be set up directly from the hospital and not have to go through the sleep lab.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Got you. Okay, and then briefly the other topic, I guess, is back to competitive bidding. Without getting too specific relative to fiscal '14, you've talked in the past about structural pricing being kind of the 3% to 4%. And then last couple of years maybe it was -- went to 6% to 8%. Is that sort of the level of expectation we should be looking at as this shakes out or is there a likelihood of a step function type of dynamic as we go through the resetting of some of these contracts ala 2007 that we can think about as people try to model both what pricing and then ultimately mix will do under competitive bidding?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Well, that's a good question, Ben, and I think you somehow got 3 questions in there by asking some sub questions around COPD. But the third question, competitive bidding yes, look, absolutely there -- are potential impacts on pricing. I think what we've said in past calls and at conferences and so on is that there's been sort of traditional 3% to 5% annual reduction, like-for-like reduction on products within the market. Could this push it to the high end of that range or even a little bit beyond it? Yes, certainly. I mean, that 5% year-on-year reduction in prices is something that we would present, expect and predict and plan for. Our job and this is something that our team has worked incredibly well on is to take more than that 5% or 5% to 6% out of COGS supply chain delivery. And we talk about the supply chain, meaning all the way from our factory to the delivered patient. So looking at the efficiency of the HME as well. So there could be some increased significant pressure, but it's not -- nothing different to what we've seen before and nothing that we weren't expecting and weren't planning for and have been executing on, I think, quite well through these first rounds of competitive bidding. So we see -- we think there'll be reasonably steady sailing through it, but we're ready for alternate weather reports.", "Peter C. Farrell", "And, Ben, just to add a little bit to that, maybe I've been smoking too much dope, but I don't recall any discussion of 6% to 8%, maybe somebody else has talked about that but there's no way ever talked about 6% to 8%. In terms of price reductions, yes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "So I guess I have heard some rumblings of some price or I guess reimbursement cuts in Germany from a couple of insurance companies over there, and I guess they were sort of doing tenders or something sort of similar to competitive bidding here in the U.S. So just wondered if you could comment on whether or not you've seen that and whether or not you've won any of those tenders.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Mike, thanks for the question, and I'll hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to add more color. He and I have been spending a lot of time over here in Europe with our European operations team. Just as sort of a prequel to that, tendering or competitive bidding in different European countries happens on an ongoing basis. So we have tenders in places like Norway and the Nordic region that we participate in on an ongoing basis, and there has been some tendering in Germany. I wouldn't sort of put it as akin to competitive bidding, I'd put it akin to the other tendering processes that we've been managing and executing on for many years in Europe. But, Rob, do you want to provide some more detail on the specific question around tendering in Germany?", "Robert Douglas", "Sure, Mick. Okay, Mike, the German insurance industry is pretty fragmented. There's about 130 insurers. Even though they have been consolidating, that's still quite a lot. Recently, councils have put out request for tender, and they went through.  Our competitors won those tenders, and they won them at pretty low prices that don't seem to include requirements for compliance monitoring or good patient service. We actually don't think that's very good care of the patient, and we don't think it's going to be a major trend in Germany. So we're keeping a careful eye on it, but we don't think it's the main thing for Germany for us.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then as the market in the U.S. moves more toward home testing and the primary care physicians get increasingly involved with those tests and writing prescriptions for CPAP, is there a risk that that's going to sort of erode the portion of these prescriptions that are branded and maybe give the HMEs a little more flexibility in determining what products they use on these patients?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, that's a good question, Mike. Certainly, with home sleep testing going from 25% of the tests to we think starting to approach 40% in the coming quarters and through the calendar year, there will be an increased influence, if you like, on the process of primary care physicians. Often, our specialist physicians still does read the study and often may make a recommendation on therapies. So the impact that specialists have in this field will not go away, but it will increase for the primary care physicians. This isn't something that is new to us, and we have been interacting with primary care physicians regarding sleep-disordered breathing for many years. We have actually some very specific programs, and I don't want to go into too much detail on this call. I don't know, Jim, if you want to provide some highlights of that, but we are working with primary care physician groups to make them aware not only of the disease state of sleep-disordered breathing, but also of the very important factor that if you're going to go from home sleep testing to positive airway pressure therapy, you're going to need to choose an algorithm that you can trust to deliver all night, every night for the rest of that patient's life. And you want to put your bet on an algorithm that has a lot of clinical validation, a lot of science and technology behind it because if you're saving money for the health care system by getting them to something that's going to keep them out of hospital, you actually want to keep them out of hospital. And the right technology is able to do that, and part of that technology is not only the algorithm, but also the data that can be taken from that algorithm, the information that we've taken to the cloud that can be used to manage that patient. And I think that's an area in terms of what I'm talking about specifically is our AutoSet algorithm and our EasyCare Online or health care informatics infrastructure. I think both of those are incredibly important factors that will weigh into the specialist but also the primary care physicians decision, and it's our job to educate them about the availability of both of those. Jim, did you have any further input or thoughts on the primary care physicians and our work with them going forward?", "James Hollingshead", "I just -- only a couple of things to add to that, Mick. I think that there will be a number of different models as different insurers shift to PSG to HST in different geographies and with independent physician groups, et cetera. So it's a complicated landscape. I don't think there's going to be a world where a primary care physician was utterly ignorant of sleep apnea is writing scripts for sleep apnea, right? There will always be some sort of influence model in there whether it's coming from an insurer or from a specialist who's read the study and is recommending the therapy and so on. And as Mick says, we have a number of programs underway right now, and I would say that some of them are early stage and we're experimenting. We have a number programs underway right now to drive awareness and brand awareness into the PCP space, but I don't think there's a huge risk associated with PCPs ending up as sort of arbiters in the space without knowing anything. It's really our job to educate the PCPs.", "Michael J. Farrell", "I'd say it's lesser risk and really an opportunity, Mike, and something that we've not only planned for but are starting to execute on, as Jim said.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just -- sorry to go back to the Germany question, but I just -- one quick follow-up on that. So is this -- you mentioned that there's been tendering in other countries in Europe. Have you -- is this the first time that there's been tendering in Germany or has that been -- have you seen that happen over the past?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, I think this is a first. Rob, you want to address it?", "Robert Douglas", "Sure, Mick, thanks. It has been going on in the past for quite a while quite. And as I've said, it's quite a fragmented insurance industry and while they are practically a common set of top-level rules, they have different practices in different companies and there has been tenders over the years there, and we've seen then come and go in the past as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just first question regards to, I guess, U.S. Flow Generators strength in the backdrop for the bidding. We've seen commentary out of Philips. In their first quarter results, they talked of a pretty tough U.S. landscape. You guys have done quite well. Can you talk about share gains, where they've been driven off the back of the informatics that you're pushing through and is that's obviously feeding into, obviously, the backdrop of competitive bidding? If I can just ask one subquestion to competitive bidding. Do you think you'll take your medicine upfront in terms of the private payers in terms of national accounts looking to negotiate now or do you truly see it staggered in line with the phasing of competitive bidding in both a CMS and the private payer sense?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Well, great, Matthew. So you gave me 2 questions all upfront. So we'll address them in order. So firstly, the Flow Generators share gains and then we'll get to the competitive bidding and upfront or staggered. So Flow Generators share gains. Again, I think Don Darkin might want to add some color after this, but just to start off, I think there are 3 major factors that are influencing our Flow Generators share growth. The first is home sleep testing is driving growth of the APAP category. ResMed has a leadership position in the APAP category with the S9 AutoSet device. So we're growing share in a growing category. That's point one. Point two, our S9 bilevels are now available across the board. And as you've heard from Geoff Neilson in his press release, in the last 24 hours, we added another S9 bilevel, and they're available all across the same platform. We think that we've had very strong growth across the high-end bilevels because the efficiencies that generates for our distributors, our customers and frankly, the value it delivers to the patient in terms of quiet, comfortable and efficacious therapy. And that's helped us on the VPAP ST, the VPAP Adapt, the AutoSet CS, the VPAP STA, and we believe it will help us on the VPAP COPD. The third point, as you alluded to, Matthew, is the health care informatics side. EasyCare Online and the cloud-based software that links into the VPAP COPD. We think that EasyCare Online in our core sleep disorder breathing market is driving added value for our customers that is leading to a preference for ResMed devices. And an important point on that is that is a sustainable competitive advantage, and it takes a long time to build up the capability and once you're ahead, you can continue to lead from the front. Don, any further thoughts or ideas on the Flow Gen share gains?", "Donald Darkin", "No, I think you covered it, Mick.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Okay. So the second question was around competitive bidding, and this I won't answer upfront, and I'll let Jim get to whether it's going to be upfront or staggered. I think there will be negotiations that happen on a daily basis with accounts with regard to pricing as the numbers came out over 30 days ago, we've already had many discussions with customers about -- for those who are winners, which those data only came out the number of weeks ago. So that's all public now. We know who the winners are. We can sit down and talk to them. We can bring out the playbook that we did in competitive bidding round one where we worked with winners, we helped them grow and we partnered with them on driving their ability to deliver with economies of scale. Jim, any thoughts on the question there with regard to medicine, upfront or staggered, Matthew's question on competitive bidding?", "James Hollingshead", "Yes, I think it's a good question, and I actually think it's a very difficult question to answer. As you say, Mick, negotiations are happening daily and the bid rates when they came out, they obviously create a ripple through the market and all of our customers' concern about reimbursement from CMS, and we're negotiating. One thing that I think works very strongly in our favor is that our products drive better compliance, and that's still a very important thing for the business model of all of our customers. And so we're going to continue to negotiate and work with our customers, both on pricing than on other things that we can do for the business. And we'll have to see how it plays out. I think we're very strongly positioned, and I think our customers recognize the value that our products bring to them, as well as our solutions like ECO. And we'll manage it as we can and we'll see how it goes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division", "I was wondering -- I had a follow-up question on EasyCare Online. I'm just wondering how much of a direct revenue driver is that or is it more you actually almost give it away and then it drives the uptake in APAP and CPAP as you've talked about?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Ian, that's a good question and, Don, I'll hand this over to you before going too far. EasyCare Online is a software provision that gives customers chances for efficiencies, the ability to remotely manage adherence in a way that is kind of unique and certainly serious value-add. I do think there is a very strong indirect influence on their choice of a Flow Generator because of that, and so that indirect strength is there. There are some direct revenues associated with the overtime AFEs and so on that we put through there but we're really focused on the innovation part that ResMed brings to the game, which is in the medical device field. But, Don, maybe want to talk to some of the other areas like our Umbian acquisition and the opportunities that we have with U-Sleep as well.", "Donald Darkin", "Thanks, Mick. Yes, it is a difficult one to try and understand whether there is actual revenue directly as we add people in ECO. Clearly, it has many functions that enable us to keep those customers in a position when we need them. With Umbian, it's a slightly different situation where we are, in fact, getting revenue from the use of Umbian. And as that software package grows, there will be other opportunities for us to see and measure. But at this point, it's a very difficult one to sort of track if that's answering your question.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division", "Yes, I was just trying to get a sense of whether -- you've had a very strong Flow Gen number this year, for this quarter in the U.S. I was just trying to get a sense of whether the EasyCare or the Umbian was a contributor there or is more just the underlying Flow Gen?", "Donald Darkin", "Yes. It certainly seems that way. But to actually put an exact track number on it's quite difficult at this point. And I think longer term, it will be easier to make a call on it. But for this stage, difficult.", "Michael J. Farrell", "So directionally, it's having influence, which is hard to quantify it, and I think is the short answer.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division", "All right. And my second question is around gross margin. I just wondering if we can get an update on how much of your production is now in Singapore and also if you could perhaps break out or give some idea of the gross margin improvement during the quarter, how much was product mix and how much was, say, manufacturing mix?", "Michael J. Farrell", "I'll hand over to Rob, and then he may hand over to Brett to give more details on gross margin contribution for the quarter.", "Robert Douglas", "Thanks, Mick. Yes, Ian, we continue to work on product cost, both on the incremental improvements and operating costs through the manufacturing system. The shift to Singapore continues to help. Our Malaysian factory producing headgear is working well. And of course, the product design teams really have a big impact on the cost of the products through as well. In terms of the exact mix of margins effects, I'll hand that over to Brett.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. Thanks, Rob. So if you look at -- if you kind of look at that year-on-year in both product mix and the manufacturing logistics improvements were both significant contributors. So we kind of don't break that down blow-by-blow, but both of them were meaningful contributors to that gross margin expansion this time.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division", "And the mix of -- and how significant is Singapore now, is that getting up to 2/3 or 70%?", "Michael J. Farrell", "It's on a blended basis, it'd be approaching 60%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "One on EasyCare Online. I'm wondering how penetrated EasyCare Online is among the installed base. Is that only S9, and is there a way to transition S8 users into EasyCare Online?", "Peter C. Farrell", "Somebody want to take that?", "Robert Douglas", "Yes, I'll have a crack at it.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Go on.", "Robert Douglas", "It's a difficult one to actually answer in a sense of what penetration we have today. We've got several hundred thousand patients in the system. But when it comes to reverting back to S8, we don't intend to do that. Going forward, obviously, we'll be covering all of our new products as they come out. But I guess it's just a tough, tough question to answer that in this period. Again, as we go forward, it's going to become clearer where we're at. But today, it's quite a difficult one to answer.", "Peter C. Farrell", "But there are no plans to go back to S8s and...", "Robert Douglas", "No, no.", "Peter C. Farrell", "There's no need. EasyCare Online is about the present and the future. And of course -- I was just going to say, and, of course, some governments such as in France are starting to mandate that you need to have compliance there and even CMS with this 90-day rule where you've got to show 30 days continuous usage. That's also part of the influence EasyCare Online is meeting or is addressing. And the S8 is -- I mean, it's being phased out, if you like, or almost has been phased out.", "Operator", "Anthony's line dropped out of the queue, so we're just going to move on to our next question from Jason Mills from Canaccord.", "Jeffrey Chu", "This is Jeff Chu filling in for Jason. I wanted to focus on your operating margins for a moment. With regard to operating margin leverage, what is the company's medium-term target for operating margins on an organic basis? And do you see M&A as a viable driver of operating margin expansion for the next 2 to 3 years?", "Peter C. Farrell", "It looks like Mick's dropped off in London. So, Rob, do you want to?", "Robert Douglas", "Yes, I think the operating margin leverage question, we'll hand over to Brett because...", "Peter C. Farrell", "Okay. There's a bit of a ping-pong here. So, Brett, you're being thrown under the bus.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. A lot -- those operating mix and targets and so on that we have is not something that we sort of publicly go out there with. But I would say -- I mean, clearly, we will look for operating leverage over time. You're certainly seeing that with, for example, SG&A spend, and you're seeing some margin expansion coming through as well. So they've really been driving out operating ratios and so on, which are in very good shape, and we will continue to do that. R&D, a little bit different. We'll absolutely invest in the product pipeline, and we'll invest on merits really from the ground up in terms of where we see gaps in the market and opportunities. So that one we look at it much more differently, if you like. But certainly, we're absolutely committed for initiative that are going to drive those operating ratios, but we're not out there on public records sort of disclosing what they are.", "Jeffrey Chu", "Okay, great. I have one last question. Did you pay the med tech tax during the quarter? And what are your expectations for the tax burden going forward?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. Jeff, we're paying a small amount, but really I think I mentioned a quarter or 2 ago really that number if you look at it annually, it would be less than $1 million. Most of our products don't fall into the device tax.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Basically, it's a hospital issue and some of our products that don't sell directly to hospitals will fall under the medical device tax of 2.3% on revenues, but it's happily, it's not material for us.", "Operator", "We're at the 1 hour mark, so now I'll turn the call back over to Dr. Peter Farrell for his final remarks.", "Peter C. Farrell", "Thank you very much. I'd just like to thank the team for their efforts, and once again, we have some first-class employees backed up by some first-class products, and we are very optimistic about the future. And so thank you for joining us today, and I'll leave you in very good hands with Mick and Rob operating within the office of the CEO. We have an extremely strong productive and excellent team across the globe. And so thanks to all for their efforts.

I'll review the highlights of our fiscal Q4, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail.", "So first, the financial summary. We finished with solid financial performance. This is the 74th consecutive quarter in which we have grown the top line since our IPO in 1995. We're pretty proud of that achievement, but we have huge opportunities in front of us. We believe we are in mile 1 of a marathon with plenty of energy, innovation and a solid strategy for the 25-plus miles to go.", "Global revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 grew 11% year-on-year to $415 million, also up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Americas revenue grew 11% to $230 million. Europe, Asia and rest of the world combined headline revenue increased 12% for the quarter. And that is 11% on a constant-currency basis.", "For fiscal year 2013, and for the first time in ResMed's history, we reached $1.5 billion in annual global revenue. We're pretty proud of this milestone. ResMed's world-leading product quality, exceptional service and our innovative data solutions all continue to drive growth and these types of results.", "Net income for the quarter increased 18% to $91 million on a non-GAAP basis, while EPS increased 17% to $0.62 for the quarter. That's also on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP numbers exclude the impact of the previously announced onetime Sydney University charge. Brett will walk you through all the details on GAAP and non-GAAP financials shortly.", "Earnings per share was a record $0.63, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles. This bottom line result demonstrates excellent global operating performance from the global team of 4,000 ResMedians.", "Our global growth in Flow Generators this quarter was primarily driven by strong sales of our leading S9 order set device, our VPAP range of bilevel devices and our latest ventilation flow generator, the Stellar.", "We continue to expand market share in the APAP and the bilevel categories as well. Our Respiratory Care products are receiving broad acceptance, especially in the treatment of COPD, the #3 killer in the Western world, and a disease that can be significantly helped with our noninvasive ventilation solutions.", "In the Americas region, flow generator sales were strong this quarter. The S9 order set and the VPAP Adapt device, which treats patients with central sleep apnea and periodic breathing, both performed particularly well. We attribute a lot of these share gains and positive mix shift to EasyCare Online and growth of home sleep testing, respectively. Additionally, we are seeing a trend that new patient growth is improving in the U.S.", "Turning to Europe. France performed well in the quarter and both our German dealer business, as well as our German homecare business had strong growth, as did the U.K. and the Nordics region. European results were driven by strength in both Flow Generators and in Masks. The order set CS, which is now on our S9 platform, and the Stellar, both did particularly well. Mask growth was also solid across the region. So despite fiscal constraints and the changing macroeconomic environment in Europe, the ResMed value proposition of treating patients at home, saving healthcare costs while improving quality of life is proving itself to be in demand.", "In the Asia-Pacific region, we had an excellent quarter, growing at solid double-digit rates. We had strong sales in mature markets like Japan, as well as in key emerging markets, including India and China. Rob, our COO, and I spent a number of weeks visiting doctors, distributors, patients and government groups throughout Asia this quarter. We believe this growth opportunity is just beginning. And as our Executive Chairman would say, we are just lacing our shoes for the Asian growth marathon. We have an excited, focused and dedicated team in that region. And that will help us drive towards this potential.", "On healthcare informatics, EasyCare Online, which is our cloud-based clinical management system, continues to lead and to grow. Additionally, our U-Sleep patient engagement solution is gaining traction. We're seeing solid uptake from both existing and new customers.", "In this challenging environment with government reimbursement changes coupled with mandates to address growing healthcare costs, we believe ResMed's core value proposition of reducing healthcare costs by taking care of respiratory diseases at home is being well received by patients, physicians, providers and by payers. It's all about driving outcomes and having the data to prove it.", "ResMed is demonstrating that we deliver these results for our customers. Regarding our patient interface business, growth was driven primarily by sales in the full face Mask category, particularly in Europe. We also saw solid growth in Mask components and accessories across the globe. We plan to stay ahead of the game in our Mask business, where we are the #1 brand preferred by patients. We're constantly innovating and our solutions will continue to be smaller, quieter, more comfortable and better than ever.", "Our product pipeline in patient innovations remains strong. We released 2 exciting new masks this quarter. First, the Quattro Air launch. It is the smallest, lightest and least obtrusive full face mask on the planet. We're very excited about its prospects for patients. And its initial reception was very positive.", "Second, we released the Swift FX Nano, our latest nasal mask. This launched in Europe and in Canada, and is progressing very well. We have plans to release more patient in face products during fiscal 2014. And we are very excited about our innovation in this space.", "Moving on to our Respiratory Care business. We had our best quarter ever in this space with record global sales. This growth is primarily due to sales of the Stellar device range in Europe, especially in Germany and in France. Japan also had a very strong quarter in Respiratory Care.", "In the U.S., Respiratory Care market sales of the VPAP COPD, specifically targeted for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, is exceeding our expectations. And the ClimateLine Oxy, a heating breathing circuit that allows oxygen connectivity to the humidified circuit, is also doing well.", "For our VPAP STA product, which advanced 2 generations from our S9 to our -- from our S7 to our latest S9 platform, we're seeing incredibly strong growth. In the humidification category, our HumiCare D900 product is doing very well in Germany and the Nordics. We also received FDA clearance for this product during the quarter. Stay tuned for additional growth and product pipeline expansion in our Respiratory Care business.", "On the home sleep testing front, now over 50% of commercially covered U.S. adult lives require PSG pre-authorization. This is steering providers and patients towards home sleep testing.", "To that point, we estimate that at the end of fiscal '13, approximately 30% of all U.S. sleep diagnostic tests were through home sleep testing. We anticipate and model that to grow to 40%-plus over the coming 12 months. And we think it will end up beyond that in the years ahead.", "Additionally, we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST. Around 60% of sleep labs in the U.S. are now offering home sleep testing based on our latest sleep lab survey data.", "Primary care physicians continue to become more involved in the diagnosis and management of sleep apnea, and are partnering with their pulmonary colleagues. That involvement is starting to gain momentum.", "Finally, an overview of our global clinical trials. Enrollment in our heart failure trial, SERVE-HF, as in a tennis \"serve\" dash \"HF,\" for heart failure is now complete with over 1,325 patients recruited.

In addition, we've completed the protocol, as shown in our press release, for a new U.S.-based heart failure study, which we are calling CAT-HF, as in \"cat\" dash \"HF.\" This trial will be run by professional Chris O'Connor, who is a global leader in heart failure and cardiovascular medicine from Duke University on the East Coast of the United States. Professor O'Connor is an accomplished clinical investigator, who has been an author on more than 400 peer-review publications in the field. We expect enrollment in CAT-HF to commence in the latter part of this calendar year.", "So let me wrap up with this. Our core sleep apnea business is no longer just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing. It's about forming partnerships with customers and offering full-service solutions for patients, providers and payers to manage outcomes for this costly chronic disease.", "This solutions approach also applies to our growing Respiratory Care business and our fast-growing Cardiorespiratory business. The combination of our range of world-leading quality Flow Generators, the most comfortable and effective patient interface systems, as well as easy to assess robust actionable software solutions makes ResMed's offering the leading value proposition for our customers. We have a robust pipeline of new masks and new technology, as well as business process innovation for the plan across our 3 horizons of growth: sleep, respiratory care and cardiology.", "We are improving patient's quality of life and preventing disease progression, as well as reducing the burden of healthcare costs for chronic diseases. We think of this as the Holy Grail of healthcare. We changed more than 7 million lives during these last 12 months.

GAAP net income for the quarter was $73 million. And GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50.", "Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.7%, up sequentially from Q3 FY '13. On a sequential basis, our gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix, manufacturing and supply chain improvements, partially offset by ASP declines.", "Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. Indeed, we estimate the weaker Australian dollar will contribute approximately 70 basis points to our gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115.1 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 9%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 27.8% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.5%. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 28% for fiscal year 2014. R&D expenses for the quarter were $31.4 million, an increase of 12% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 14%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.6% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.5%. Looking forward, we expect our R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, as the majority of our research in development is undertaken in Australia.", "During the quarter, we reached an agreement with the University of Sydney to pay $24.8 million for the establishment of 2 perpetual academic chairs, the funding of future research in the fields of sleep medicine and biomedical engineering, and the settlement of a legal proceedings between the parties. This is a nonrecurring charge and we have expensed the full amount of $24.8 million in our fourth quarter results.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.5 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9% compared to the prior-year quarter effective tax rate of 22%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects a tax benefit from the Sydney University charge and the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rates associated with our Singapore manufacturing operation. Excluding the impact of the Sydney University charge, our full year effective tax rate was 20.7%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail.

It's been such a big topic of discussion in the industry both in the investor [ph]industry and in the sleep apnea industry. And you can't spend more than 5 minutes in the industry without people giving you sort of 20 examples of big profit lock. Can you just talk about what you're seeing, and why you think the market is getting it so wrong in the message that they're getting from your customers?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Dan. That question allows us to talk about our long-term cost control and investment strategies looking forward. But, yes, certainly, price is a question. I mean, it's the discussion that comes up with our customers because it's Monday morning. And the sun is out. And it comes into the question when is the end of the quarter, and when is the start of the quarter. So price is always the discussion for us with our customers. We tend to focus on looking for the long term. We invest in driving growth through volume gain, and can use price as a tool as part of that. And when we work with customers, and they are seeking price discounts, we look for volume gains to get there. We also, when the topic of price comes up, and we're discussing price, we look at the long-term value that we provide the customer, which we are very good at modeling at and getting better at as we look at the economics of our HME customers in the U.S. and our HCP, home care provider customers in Europe, and the many other business models we have in the 100 countries we do business in. And as we analyze that, we're able to come up with effective ways to take costs out of the supply chain, to take costs out of the system through electronic data in change or whether it's healthcare informatics data or supply data and beyond. So in short, we've talked about traditionally a sort of 3% to 5% price reduction that we've seen in the market. It's probably more in the 4% to 6% range now. And you can model that sort of range going forward. But it's certainly something that when we look at our cost structure and we look at our investments for the future, we're looking at taking more than that 4% to 6% out so that we can maintain our margins. And as you saw in these quarter's results, we had a very solid 62%-plus number. And we're pretty proud of that.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And just one other one. Just in regards to the ventilation business. I know you don't break that out, but can you give us an indication of just how material that is becoming? And I mean, we're just trying to understand what level of this pretty extraordinary U.S. flow gen [ph] growth -- or sorry, global flow gen [ph] growth is being driven by the respiratory part of the business?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Dan. We're not going to break out our Respiratory Care or ventilation business. We already, as the only global pure play and respiratory medicine company who's public, expose every 90 days a far greater deal of granularities than any of the other players out there. We have to do research to understand how the other 2 large-ish players are doing. But I can talk to it directionally. And certainly, the growth in Respiratory Care is very strong. We're #1 or #2 in every Respiratory Care home-care market throughout Western Europe. But we are not that in the Americas and many parts of Asia-Pacific. So there's a huge opportunity in front of us to grow our U.S. Respiratory Care business, to grow our Latin American Respiratory Care business, to grow our Respiratory Care business in many countries in Asia-Pacific where often our products can move from the hospital to the home. And that hospital-to-home approach is something that we've had excelled at in Europe, and can bring to the other markets around the world. So I think although the core growth in the global Respiratory Care space is probably in the mid-single digits, we can beat that by going after new geographic expansion, and also creating and leveraging new categories that our technologies as a leader in the sleep disorder breathing space with a cost structure and scale that brings can allow us to penetrate and expand, take share, but also grow reach in the global Respiratory Care business.", "Operator", "The next question comes Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So following on the prior question, maybe talk a little bit about something that's been rather topical. Did the checks that people are getting where DMEs are claiming 20% price cuts and concessions from you guys and from other players, how do you characterize that? Where is that coming from? Is that things you're walking away from or in some cases, you're taking in exchange for volumes? Or these comments have been quite broad spread, and I'm just trying to get some context on where people are wrong if they're taking those data points.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Ben, I'm going to hand this question over to Jim Hollingshed, who's our President for the Americas. But just on the global scope of things, we're in 100 countries. These data point that I believe were published by someone doing research was in one of those countries -- the U.S., which happens to be around 50% of our revenues. But it's one data point out of thousands of customers. So with that caveat, I'll hand over to Jim to provide some color to your question.", "James Hollingshead", "Thanks, Mick. Hi Ben. So guys obviously, what's going on in the Americas market is the implementation of competitive bidding. And that implementation literally just went live. And so when the run-up to that the price points that came out of competitive bidding are painful for our customers. And we talked about that last quarter. And I think that's the first point I would make because we understand its painful for our customers and we're working through that with them. In terms of -- we're not going to talk about any specific deals or any specific customers. I would say that our practice in pricing remains the way it has been, which is we use pricing strategically. And so when we do deals with customers, we're typically doing them either because we're gaining volume or we're gaining share. We're doing something that makes economic sense for us and for our customers. The price trend in the market, we've been saying for a long time that in the category, has consistently had ASP declines in the 3% to 5% range on an annualized basis. And as Mick just said, that's probably moved now to maybe a 4% to 6% annualized range. I would say in the quarter in the run-up to the implementation of competitive bidding, we have seen some increase in short-term price pressure. But we dealt with that strategically. And we're working with our customers to help them address their business needs. And price is only one way that we work with our customers, all right? So we do other things with our customers. We're -- on a product basis, clearly, we provide products that create more value for them to drive more compliance to more effective products. And we're increasingly introducing solutions that help them run their business more efficiently as well, things like ECO and the U-Sleep platform. So price is an issue. CB2 is an issue in the marketplace. But it's, I think -- bluntly, I think it's been overblown and the way people are looking at the market broadly, it's painful for our customers. And we're working that through with them.", "Michael J. Farrell", "And I know -- I'd add on to that. Thanks, Jim. Great performance with your comments, and I'd add on to that. But this is not Coke versus Pepsi in a limited soft drink market growing 0% to 3%. This is about a market where we're less than 10%, 15% penetrated even in the U.S., which is our most penetrated market of all our geography. So it's about the 85% in front of us and in finding the right investments to make, to grow those markets. But I underline Jim's comments.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And, Jim, just following on with that, I know the run-up has maybe been a little bit more intense. Why wouldn't they intensify further? Is there something about that run-up that then sets price for the coming period? Or are we going to continue to have this intensification when we talk next quarter and the December quarter?", "James Hollingshead", "Well, Ben, I think that's a really good question. And we don't have a crystal ball and so it's hard for us to predict exactly what's going to happen. But in the run-up period, what's going on, of course, is that people who've won and accepted contracts, and I'll make a side point there, which is not everybody accepted the contracts, right, because there are a number of players out there that have decided that they can make more money in commercial pay. But those who have won and accepted contracts are building business models of there after the quarter and getting ready to implement against what will probably be higher volume for them. And they need to understand how they're going to run their businesses so they're negotiating for price in front of that, right? So it's hard to know exactly what will happen, say, over the next quarter or next 2 quarters as that continues to play itself out. And we're going to continue to work strategically with all the leverage we win for our customers' businesses. But I think that if you just look at what they're getting ready for as Medicare throws the switch on the pricing, our anticipation is that most of the pressure is probably Q4 and maybe into Q1 a little bit.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And then the private payers are they following on? Or is this sort of a delayed response on their side? And that's it.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Look, I'll answer that, Jim, if that's okay with you. The Medicare CMS competitive bidding process has been in place for 4, 5-plus years. All these changes have been signaled with 12, 24 even 36 months notice for the customers. So our company's pretty sophisticated, we've been able to model out their economics pretty intense around 1, around 2 and beyond. So there's nothing new that's going to happen from today, from yesterday. And frankly, since the numbers came out earlier this calendar year, there's been no changes to those core economics. But historically, CMS has been priced significantly above all the private payers, which is kind of unique in med tech. Usually, it's the other way around. And as CMS has seen that 4 years ago, like an efficient government process, they took 4 years to get there, but have eventually, 4 years later, got in line with the private payers. We don't think this triggers a response from your private payers and we haven't seen that. The private payers have been looking at this quarterly over those 4 years and we'll continue to look at it on an ongoing basis as well. Thanks for the questions, Ben.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question calls -- comes from Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Some of the other things I've seen speaking to your customers is that they are looking for perhaps a broader entry level device -- a fixed pressure device that captures all the compliance requirements. I think we're seeing one of your competitors come out with such a product. Are you guys considering moving back into that fixed pressure segment of the market? Or is your focus still the high-end APAP segment?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So we've been playing in the fixed CPAP market since 1989. And we've been playing in the APAP category with our AutoSet range since 1992, I think. So both of these 2 decades\u2019 worth of experience playing in both in fixed pressure and auto-setting pressure categories. The reason we believe -- in fact, we're incredibly confident that APAP as a category will continue to grow, is that APAP is a requirement for the cost savings achieved through home sleep testing. To make home sleep testing effective, you have to be able to allow the patient to have their pressure set in the home. And the only way to do that cost effectively is with an APAP category device. Our S9 AutoSet happens to have that 20 years of legacy in its algorithm and advances, and we believe is the leading algorithm in that space. So we believe the category of APAP will continue to grow share. And we believe that the S9 AutoSet will continue to grow share within that growing category. And so therefore, we are already in the fixed pressure device category. And we will remain there. There are some markets and some geographies and some patient groups for which CPAP pressure is the best approach. But there are many, and it's growing, of the greater value of our products like the S9 AutoSets are incredibly important. So we're already there, and we'll continue to play in CPAP. But driving the high-value APAP category is just part of an industry trend and we are absolutely on top of that, and a big part of it. While thinking about flow generators and the types of margins, the real highest end of this range is our Respiratory Care business. And that's an area where we are playing with customers with much higher cost basis and bringing in devices from the sleep space. So we think that opportunity to have margins at solid levels into the future is driven by not only the CPAP and APAP categories, but also by the VPAP category, which is the bilevel devices, and really importantly the noninvasive ventilation devices like our Stellar product.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And maybe just a separate follow-up question. But you mentioned the small increase in ASP declines to be the same. Can you talk to what impact do you think competitive bidding this year will have on volume growth to the industry? And whether you realistically think you will see DMEs closing down patients having to migrate across to other stores. How impactful do you think this whole process will be on the DME base?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So we have the real-time experiment with round 1 where we believe that as some of the smaller mom-and-pop type HMEs went out of business in some cases. Larger regionals and some large national players took the share of patients. And we were worried about some orphan patients in their process, patients that had a device and didn't have anyone following up with the Mask side. What we found was that the large regionals and the large nationals, with their very efficient systems for contacting patients, and checking appropriately if they need new masks and accessories, as they picked up those patients, we saw some increase in volume on the trailing revenue side, the opportunity for Masks & Accessories. So I would say it's probably mutual on the Device side. But there may be some volume upside on the Masks & Accessories side. But that's how we'd look at round 1 and round 2. We're in day 31. So we'll be watching that on an ongoing basis. But we would expect the same model to play out as the same types of people have become the winners in round 2, as we're winners during round 1. I don't know if, Jim, you'd like to add any more detail?", "James Hollingshead", "Yes. I completely agree with what you said. And I would just add a couple of things. I think it's computing for the patients, but it's not computing for the DMEs at some level, right? So the next point, any DMEs that they're buying up a patient list from a smaller DME is doing that because they know they're going to go find that patient and work with them, right? So I think the way Medicare has communicated to patients has created some confusion for patients. And so there's -- that's got to be worked through. But I think the people buying list will figure that out from the DME side. I don't think CB2 has a material impact on volume and market overall, except they might have upside, as Mick has described. I think U.S. market, and therefore America's volume, is likely to be more impacted by the shift to home sleep testing, which is we think is bringing in more new patient volume right now. And the reason for that is commercial pairs are shifting the market to home sleep testing. And home sleep testing is more acceptable to the patient. So it's a long time been a barrier for patient to get tested for OSA because they don't want to go spend the night in a lab. And as payers move to HST, more patients on the market are going to agree to get tested. And we think that's already creating a little bit of a lift in total new patient volume to the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Prior with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a follow-up question, I guess, from solds in terms of volume instruction, and Mick or Jim, if you want to take this. I guess one of the other things in regards to the volume discount deals that's being done. Given with round 1, on the wash-up from round 1, we saw from CMS reports that utilization of volumes has slowed down. Do the volume discount deals being done around this period of CB2 help mitigate that volume slow down risk going into, obviously, the September quarter?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Jim?", "James Hollingshead", "I don't -- I think there's conflicting data on utilization and growth in the market. I don't see a big risk to a drop in utilization to Medicare. And I think that the incidents and problems of disease keeps going up. The latest data that I've seen from Medicare shows that the max of all increase in claims over the last couple of quarters. And as I say, I think the overall market is growing. So again, I don't -- that's not how I would think about the model of the volume of the market.", "Michael J. Farrell", "And, Matthew, you -- if adjusting on competitive bidding, you're thinking about the 25% of the market that is CMS. The 75% of the market, that is private payers, looking at this differently. And many of them has had for many years disease management programs. Many of them are now starting to look at care management programs. As we have conversations with payers, we are driving conversations along with our HME partners that drive towards the opportunity for our therapies to take patients out of the hospital and to save money, and to improve the quality of life for the patients. This matters especially to the employers who are the payers customers, who are self-insured. It matters incredibly importantly to the new accountable care organizations or ACOs that are forming as part of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. And we're going to see more and more systems of payer provider combination, such as you have at the VA, at Kaiser, at Intermountain Health, at Geisinger. Those types of models are going to expand. And we think the long-term return on investment -- in fact, we know the long-term return on investment of taking a patient with sleep-disorder breathing and getting them on treatment saves money for the healthcare system. So we think that 75% of the market is more apt on the private side for those conversations and fresh for it. We think the government will probably follow. But that will be our take on the long-term view and plans for care management.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. And just my second question in terms of, I guess, again, focusing on the volume-type deals that are done to offset the pricing impact, when you think of the big 3 manufacturers, you represent such a large portion of the whole industry. With the small guys now, you're relatively small in market share terms. If all the big 3 are doing volume discount-type deals, and that's why each of the 3 have tried to offset the price impact of competitive bidding. Obviously, they're getting market share winners or losers out of that? And if you're a DME that's been offered a similar deal from all 3 brands, who do you obviously favor then in terms of giving that volume to then, obviously, get that discount from that manufacturer? Can you talk about like the CMS order effect on this? And whether compliance provider payout point of view of private or government is having influence? So do you think you will win out on that market share front because of compliance bartering the [indiscernible]? And as the market shifts in that direction, is that a fair statement or -- because obviously there's going to have to be winners and losers are out of this in terms of market share in order to kind of stay neutral on the pricing effect?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Well, thanks, Matthew. That was a very complex question with a multi-varied areas that actually we could take the whole -- rest of the Q&A session to go through each of them. I'll choose to focus, which are great questions in some ways. I'll focus on your question about the big 3 and what -- really the big 2, what will happen with the market going forward. I think as we partner with our HME providers in the U.S. and with our homecare providers in Europe and the different models we have in different geographies, our strong partnerships in Japan, we're getting a much greater understanding of the value of our products, the value of our health informatics products to provide data to a payer or data to a provider or data to a physician. And now, with SleepSeeker and U-Sleep data to a patient. And the value associated with all of that. So the discussion of will our market share grow or decline is less to do with the latest changes in U.S. Medicare reimbursement. It's more to do with the long-term value proposition of what we bring to the market, an understanding of that. You saw the data that we showed that our brand value from patients is very high in the Mask area. We've known that for many years. But what we're getting to understand more is our brand value with our partners, the providers, the physicians and the customers, and how we can save them money and save them time. So we think rational economic decisions will be made along the value chain. And we think ResMed is well-positioned to grow its market share based upon those rational economic decisions, based on real value that we bring to our customers. And a lot of that is tied to the ResMed brand. The underlying foundation for that is the core economic and strategic growth value we bring to the market. The SERVE-HF study is just an example of how we're driving long-term growth. But there are multi-varied detailed areas that we provide value that we don't have time to cover in this call, but we can in upcoming calls.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, will make this as just a confirmation that to offset competitive bidding with the revenue line, you really have to take market share step by step?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So, yes. Look, as price goes down, the volume goes up. Cost structures go down. Cost was taken out of the system to keep gross margin where it's at. We have to -- if this 4% to 6% price declines on an annualized basis, we have to take 4% to 6% out of the total cost structure. But there are probably many different ways to drive long-term economic value apart from just looking at the GM line. I don't know if others want to have a comment?", "James Hollingshead", "I will just add, I do think the question's a bit complicated. And I now understand what you're trying to get, Matthew. So excuse me for being a little slow on the uptake. But it depends on how fast the market's growing, right? And globally, the market continues to have healthy growth. In the Americas, the market continues to have healthy growth. And so we can gain or lose market share and still have a healthy business depending on our underlying market growth. As it happens, the market is growing, and we're taking share. And we're taking share because our products are better. And our products aren't just better on some abstract feature and functionality sense, they're better because they're more comfortable, which means that patients are more compliant and in the U.S. reimbursement scheme, that means our DMEs get paid on a higher percentage of patients to get set up on our devices. And they get more replenishment revenue out of us -- they're better from a revenue point of view. And we're also taking share because our solutions take costs out and help our customers drive more efficiency. And that's how our system works. We invest in innovation to make it better for our patients and for our customers. So market's growing and we're taking share.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Alex Smith with Citigroup.", "Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You mentioned your patient growth is improving. Does that mean market growth rates will then move beyond the 6% to 8%? And can you make some comments around market growth?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Alex. Our market growth outlook is still in the 6% to 8% range on a revenue basis globally. And I would say in the Americas market, it's around 6% to 8% as well. In Europe, we're probably looking at the low end of that -- 6% or slightly lower. In Asia-Pacific, we're looking at north of the 8% into the double digits. So those market's growth numbers as best we can tell are there. We're starting to see some volume uptick in the U.S., as we mentioned in our remarks earlier, offset somewhat by some of the price declines that we are seeing in that geography. But over the globe, we're looking at a solid 6% to 8% market growth industry. As I go to JPMorgan and go to all these med tech conferences, is a pretty darn good growth rate for a med tech space. And to be positioned at #1 or #2 in that space in all of the 100 countries we're in we think is a very solid position to be in. But it's not material enough for any of those individual country changes yet to change that sort of 6% to 8% global growth number. But it's a complex calculation, Alex. It's not simple. We know in detail 40-something percent of it because it's our revenues. We don't know the other 50% as well and have to garner that the way you do. But our estimate is solid in that 6% to 8% range globally.", "Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And Brett, can you -- what sort of currency assumptions are you seeing, and particularly for U.S. dollar in saying that it will add 70 basis points to gross margin?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Were you wondering who are addressing?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. No, I'll take that, Alex. Yes, so looking at that as you know, with the infield washing through, you've always got about a one-quarter lag on currency. So if that's -- that's sort of in play now. That's already happening in terms of that improvement there. Going forward, as it washes through, if you're looking to quarter 2 and 3 with current exchange rates and you'll certainly get incremental benefit north of that as we work into Q2. But essentially, Q1 gets locked in and then we should get some more benefit coming through in Q2 as inventory washes through this system. So if -- and currency is a really volatile environment, so you never know for sure. But at current rates, you would expect that we'll get 70 basis points in Q1, and then we should get a bit better in Q2.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I want to switch gears a little bit here and get back to your clinical trials. What is the timing of when we will see the SERVE-HF data?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So, Joanne, the SERVE-HF trial has just completed enrollment this last quarter. So 1,325 patients enrolled, but it's a 2-year follow-up study. So each patient, including the last ones that were enrolled, have to remain on the therapy for 2 years. Just as a reminder for everybody, the 2 outcomes from that trial, that the trial is powered for, is mortality and morbidity. So saving lives and saving money through hospitalization reduction. So we need to keep those patients on for 2 years. So that pushes us to about this time, 2015, when the final patient has reached that 2-year mark. Then we have to assess the data. Of course, this is a completely blinded trial to ResMed and to the investigators. So it's a CIC that has to be unblinded, and then analyzed and go through all the bio analytics and so on. And then it has to go seek publication in a large cardiovascular journal and get put on the conferences. So in short, we're looking late calendar '15, early calendar '16 for those data to be released to the public and then we'll be discussing on those types of conference calls. So it's a real long-term investment for the industry. And we're really proud that it's the largest study to ever complete enrollment and when it finishes, we think it will be the largest and most important in pivotal study in heart failure treatment with adaptive servo-ventilation. And we are very excited about its prospects.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. My second question has to do with the U.S. Mask market. It was a little bit weak in the third fiscal quarter and a little bit weaker in the fourth fiscal quarter, and I was just curious, do you have any color on what may be going on there?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Joanne. Yes, clearly, we have seen some pressure, competitive pressure on the patient interface front. We love a health industry. We love various industry players coming to compete in the different categories. The Mirage FX had, had many, many, quarters of incredible success through this launch a couple of years ago in the nasal category space. Recently, Philips Respironics introduced their Wisp mask into that category. And F&P introduced their Eson mask into that category. So we have seen some pressure in the nasal mask category. Mirage FX remains the best, we believe. But the others have some value propositions that are being trialed and selected by some customers. As we said in the pre-remarks, we have a very solid pipeline in patient interfaces. And over the coming fiscal year '14, you will see us release products not only into that nasal category, but beyond that without going into any further granularity as to those releases. And we will not say by quarter, by category because we're the only public player in this space. We're very excited about the patient interface pipeline and as it comes to market, we think our customers will, as they have historically, see its value.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Clair with Piper Jaffray.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I have another mask question as well. So we saw a pretty nice reacceleration, all U.S. I was hoping you could maybe tell us what you think is driving the rebound there?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Rob, do you want to address that perhaps...", "Robert Douglas", "Yes. And look, I think it's just cost supported markets where teams have been performing well and executing well, getting the deals, servicing the customers. We think the competitive products have been there for a while and they have had some impact, but it's not permanent impact. So some response from that. Overall, just good performance all around really. We're having a good quarter in many, many countries around the world.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Regarding some pretty strong relationships, David, with our European customers and the value that we bring on the masks are very different. They don't get paid on a per unit basis as reimbursement is in the U.S. So the value is more long term. So some of those assessments are more long term. But we've been able to provide that data to them and we think that communication and that partnership with our major customers in Europe and throughout Asia-Pac has allowed us to drive that Europe and Asia-Pacific mask growth. And we think it's reasonably sustainable into the future because the value you get is over a long period of time and it can be sustainable.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And a quick one for Brett. You alluded to pricing impact in gross margin in the quarter? Can you quantify how much of an offset that was to gross margin?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Well, I mean it's working through on the really around that 4% to 6% range on ASPs and sort of working through that impact, David. So if you look at the kind of the drivers on the gross margin was, obviously, we're still getting favorable product mix coming through. And we're also working pretty hard on the cost basis, Mick mentioned around manufacturing around our supply chain and procurement and so on. So those have been the drivers really of the margin expansion for a while now. And traditionally, we've always had some offsets with ASP declines. It is typically 3% to 5% and around the 4% to 6%. And that's the major offset, but you can still see that we're still getting expansion in our gross margins. So those positive drivers are currently outweighing ASP declines. But it does have some negative impact.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division", "Yes. Could I ask a follow-up question on gross margin? Just asking if you look at the drivers, Brett, in fiscal '13 looking forward to '14, you're looking at cost out mix shift to Singapore and also the bilevels. Which of those factors do you think were strongest in '13? And which will have the same sort of character in '14?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "I think, I mean they're both meaningful contributors. And, no, if you look at it over the years and on the trends, pretty consistent kind of contributors for both of those. We continue to -- it depends how fast and how the mix goes through FY '14. It is notoriously difficult to predict on some of these mix changes and timing of when we get, for example, improvements coming through on manufacturing. It is driven, for example, by new product introduction and so on where we can get some, if you like, kind of step change-type improvements. And then we work on a bunch of incremental improvements along the way. So that can -- coming at various times. But I think looking forward, I still think we'll get a benefit from both of those. And we will, if the currencies sort of stay where they are, we'll get some tailwind from the currency as well, which is back -- the Aussie is back to where it was selling like 3 years ago selling against the U.S. dollar. So we've been up against headwinds on the currency for quite a few years and that looks like we may get some benefit from the currency going forward. And that's also into the gross margin mix. And so I think now you can have -- you have 3 positive factors playing out on that margin and you'll just have the negative on the ASP. But so far, we've built -- with currency, and we'll deal with other things that are thrown at us and continue to work hard on cost out initiatives.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division", "Great. Can I ask a last, perhaps, Mick or Jim, on the pricing? The ResMed has always been historically a premium price player. And after on a sort of like-for-like basis after budding discounts, where do you see your premiums, your 2P is currently?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Ian, we're not going to go into the detail of pricing information. But generically and globally, we are the premium player. The premium may be in the single digits on some flow generator lines. It might be in the double digits in terms of percentages on some of our high-differentiated items at the high end of, say, the Mask range or the Respiratory Care range where we have the value given to the customer. All those premiums on pricing are linked to the premium that the customer attributes to the value of that product. And so it's by SKU, it's by geography, it's by customer and it's by our current share with the customers and our future growth opportunities with the customers. So it's a very complex equation. But in short, we haven't changed that philosophy. We're the value player. We're the premium player. And we maintained ourselves as the value player in this Q4 and throughout fiscal year '13. And we will do that going forward in FY '14. We think the discipline of pricing to your value is incredibly important for the long-term sustainable growth of this industry. And the investments that we are making in a $20 million, $30-plus million trials in SERVE-HF to change the potential trajectory of millions of heart failure patients only comes by linking value to pricing, to long-term investments for the industry. So the short answer is we are a value player. And we will maintain ourselves as a value player going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just on -- a couple for Brett and one for Mick. The $5.8 million in other expense, was that all AUD hedge losses and heavy renewed year hedges and more favorable rates considering the currency move? And then just a follow-up for Mick.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, Anthony. That is essentially FX hedging losses that have come through. We do mark-to-market. So basically, that brings forward any losses into that quarter. So as you think about if currencies then stay pretty much exactly the same, then you get fairly negligible FX gains and losses going forward. Of course, that'll move around. But essentially, that's what would happen. So that's basically what that was. And your other question, Anthony?", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Sure. If we elaborate a little bit, Mick, on the volume sort of range, and instead you're engaging with DME customers, can you sort of go into actually how those are structured? Are you requiring them to purchase up from volumes, excess inventories upfront? Or are those commitments over an extended period of time? And then maybe just a quick follow-up would be are there any other promotions that you will be engaging in as you move into the round 2?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So the short answer is, Anthony, there's nothing new in this space. The long answer is that we don't go into detailed descriptions of any of our contracts with customers in any geography. Some of them can be a month. And some of them can be 2 years. And some of them have volume commitments. Some of them have strategic market development commitments that we make to each other. The variance across our contracts with the thousands of customers we do is so broad. But there was nothing new in Q4. And we don't plan to do anything new in fiscal '14 in terms of volume and pricing arrangements. What we intend to do is invest for the long-term sustainable growth of this industry. And with 99%-plus of the opportunity left in countries like China and India, that Rob and I were at just a couple of weeks ago, with certainly 95% of the opportunity in front of us in Asia, with 90-plus percent of the opportunity in Europe and 85%-plus of the opportunity left in the Americas, we think that we truly are in mile 1 of the marathon and we're not getting tired.", "Operator", "We are now at the 1-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thank you very much. And what I'd like to say is as always, thanks to the many investors, analysts and customers, and even the competitors who listen to this conference call. But most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to the nearly 4,000 employees of ResMed from Asia-Pacific, Europe and Americas for their hard work, dedication and continued excellence. Together, we are changing lives in respiratory medicine one breath at a time. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the fourth quarter 2013 ResMed Inc.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Maisha. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Constance Bienfait, Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Constance, you may begin.", "Constance C. Bienfait", "Thank you, Maisha, and thank you, all, for joining us today. The company has asked me to address certain matters.", "First, ResMed does not authorize recording of any portion of this conference call for any purpose.", "Second, during the conference call, ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. These statements are made under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in ResMed's SEC filings, such as Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which you can access through the company's website at www.resmed.com. [Operator Instructions]", "Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team here present that will be available to answer questions.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, go ahead.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Great. Thanks, Connie, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll review the highlights of our fiscal Q1, and then hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail.", "So first, the financial summary. Global revenue in Q1 of fiscal 2014 grew 5% year-on-year, to $358 million, that's up 4% on a constant-currency basis.", "Americas revenue grew 4% to $202 million. Europe, Asia and the rest of the world headline revenue increased 7% for the quarter, which is 5% growth in constant currency terms. We believe the overall global growth of the industry remained steady at 6% to 8%, with global flow generator growth in the 4% to 6% range and global Mask category growth at approximately 8% to 10%.", "Net income for the quarter increased 14% to $81 million, while earnings per share increased 14% to $0.56 for the quarter. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the team.", "I'm going to start with an overview on Europe, where we saw a strong regional growth, with solid performance in many countries, including France -- particularly France, the U.K., as well as Switzerland. Both our German homecare business and our German dealer business also grew strongly.", "The European results were driven by strength in both flow generators and Masks. One of the main drivers of flow generator growth in Europe was the AutoSet CS product. This product includes the proprietary PaceWave algorithm that is designed for congestive heart failure patients with cardiorespiratory disorders, including Cheyne-Stokes respiration, amongst others.", "We also saw strong growth in our Respiratory Care products throughout Europe, including continued adoption of our Stellar ventilation platform.", "Mask growth was also solid across the European region, with both the Quattro Air and the Swift FX Nano masks being well received across the region.", "In France, the government confirmed during the quarter that its telemonitoring requirements would take effect right at the start of this quarter, on October 1. We believe that this announcement during the quarter dispelled any confusion in the homecare provider space in France, and will help ResMed grow its share in both the flow generator and the emerging healthcare informatics space in France, as well as across Europe.", "We are starting to see success in the way we position EasyCare Online solutions for monitoring requirements, not only in France, but also in other parts of Europe. Building on the strength in the U.S., this is becoming a global trend. We expect that success to continue.", "We announced on our website today that we have acquired an Eastern European-based distributor of sleep-disordered breathing, as well as respiratory care products. The acquisition is in Poland, the country with a population of around 40 million, and a gross domestic product of around USD 490 billion. This acquisition strengthens our presence in Eastern Europe, allowing us to expand ResMed's reach to help more patients with access to comfortable and effective treatment for respiratory disorders and also, to be able to more closely support the local homecare provider networks in developing respiratory care, as well as cardiorespiratory markets. This acquisition is an element of our ongoing global emerging market growth strategy.", "In the Asia Pacific region, sales were lumpy, influenced by our business primarily in Japan. The long-term opportunities in this region remain incredibly strong, especially in our emerging markets -- growth opportunities in this region, with a focus particularly on China, as well as India.", "In the Americas, we saw steady 5% flow generator growth, knowing that we were up against a very tough prior year comparison. Flow generators were up 17% in Q1 fiscal 2013, and we hit 5% in Q1 2014. This 5% increase is in line with market growth, which we said is around 4% to 6%. We are holding share in this category. The strong mix shift from CPAP to APAP was evident again as the trend to home sleep testing continues to drive this mix shift.", "The S9 AutoSet remains our flagship product in this region, and it is growing well. We're seeing a trend that new patient growth is very solid in the U.S. And we attribute some of the growth that is part of that trend to the increased availability of home sleep testing. We estimate that approximately 35% of all U.S. sleep diagnostic tests are now with HST. This is driven primarily by payer mandates.", "We also think that HST will grow in the next 12 months to around 40% to 45% of all tests done within the U.S.", "Additionally, we continue to see a steady increase in the number of sleep labs involved in HST. We think it's around 55%, based on our latest sleep lab survey data, but sleep labs are really engaging in HST and looking to offer it as a choice to patients. And we're partnering with our sleep labs to help provide our ApneaLink services, our VPAP Tx services and other services that can help them diagnose patients.", "In terms of Respiratory Care devices in the Americas, we are seeing positive early trends with our VPAP ST-A and our VPAP COPD products. You'll remember VPAP COPD was just recently launched. Both of these are now on the S9 platform. These products have a long lead sales cycle, and we expect this growth to continue over the coming quarters and beyond. We are taking share in the respiratory care space, and these products are positive margin contributors.", "We believe regulatory approval of the Stellar product in Brazil is imminent, and we expect that this will be a great geographic market for growth, given its particular homecare ventilation needs in that geography. We are making good progress on our Respiratory Care pipeline, and we plan to launch a new Respiratory Care platform for patients in fiscal year 2014.", "Masks in the Americas were up against a tough year-on-year comparison. Masks, if you remember, grew 13% year-on-year in Q1 fiscal 2013. We acknowledge that we lost share in this quarter due to a competitive product cycle, particularly in the nasal category and, to a lesser extent, in the pillows category. We held share in the full face category, helped by initial momentum from the launch of Quattro Air. It was released late in the fourth quarter.", "As I stated in our press release, the Quattro Air is on its way to being one of our best mask product launches ever. And there's lots of runway left for that product. We're only 90 days in. We also launched the Swift FX Nano in the U.S. during September, which is just a couple of weeks ago, the last month, obviously, of the quarter. The Nano has a low-profile nasal cushion, minimal headgear, and we expect the Nano to help get us back on the front foot in the nasal category. We have had a leading position in the masks space for many years and we will maintain that. We obviously expect competition in this space, and we expect customers to sample new competitive products. The increasing competition, in fact, in the nasal and pillow categories demonstrates that the market continues to look for, and reward, new product innovation, despite the ongoing reimbursement pressures. We think that's good for our business because innovation is our strong suit. We have an incredibly exciting pipeline of innovative new masks across all the categories coming out over the next 3, 6, 9 months and beyond, with one mask launch, literally, just around the corner.", "There's been a round of competitive bidding launched on July 1, the first day of the quarter that we're talking through here, Q1. And that caused some distraction, as we've talked about, for our U.S. channel in the quarter. Our HME customers had new reimbursement rates that were announced in February but went into effect on July 1. Remember, CB 2 is a significant part of Medicare, which is around 25% of the HME payer portfolio in the U.S. market. HMEs who won new CB 2, or competitive bidding 2 -- I'll use CB 2 as an abbreviation in this call, contracts in geographies where they didn't have a brick-and-mortar presence now have to set up subcontracts. HMEs who won CB 2 in areas where they have an established presence now have to collect paperwork on the new Medicare patients and establish replenishment programs for those new patients.", "HMEs who lost contracts in CB 2 are now working on driving new referrals for commercial payers, which is the other 75% of their payer portfolio, and on subcontracting partnerships for the 25%, that is CB 2. It looks to us that CB 2 has temporarily impacted volumes in the U.S. market, but as that distraction clears, volumes will pick up to meet the ongoing growth in patient demand.", "As I said earlier, we have seen new patient growth that is solid, and the underlying fundamental patient dynamic of home sleep testing is driving that. And the fact that 85% of this most penetrated of our markets, which is the U.S., 85% of the patients still need to be diagnosed and treated. That's a lot of runway ahead of us.", "We continue to see the trends that sleep-disordered breathing and COPD prevalence, awareness and patient referrals are all growing. It's notable that in the Round One Recompete bid that was announced during Q1, the reimbursement rates for sleep and respiratory care products increased versus CB 2. We believe this is a very good indicator. With CB 2 rates and contracts now in effect, and have been in effect for over 90 days, we're encouraged that uncertainty is receding and customers are focusing on how to succeed in this new environment.", "We're partnering with our HME customers and helping them take cost out of our mutual supply chain and out of the system. Our solutions include EasyCare Online, U-Sleep, electronic data interchange, replenishment optimization, drop ship programs, PCP awareness, and patient engagement programs and more in the healthcare informatics space.", "As a particular example in the healthcare informatics management space, we announced an alliance at Medtrade during the quarter with Brightree. Brightree is a cloud-based software development company. The ResMed online store will now be integrated with Brightree's HME management solutions, simplifying the ordering process for our mutual HME customers. So HME customers who use Brightree's systems will be able to order ResMed products with a single login and access to inventory availability data directly in their own management systems. This makes it easier to do business with ResMed and it makes it more cost efficient to do business with ResMed. Brightree's share of the healthcare informatics space is somewhere in the 30% to 40% range, we believe, in the HME management solutions based in the U.S.", "As an example of patient engagement programs, we just crossed over the 1-year anniversary mark for our Wake Up to Sleep offering. Wake Up to Sleep is ResMed's comprehensive sleep apnea support community. It's intended to help people along their entire sleep-disordered breathing journey from awareness, to diagnosis, to treatment, to ongoing adherence. There are already multiple tens of thousands of people signed up for the program, which focuses on the lifelong value to the patient.", "Once engaged, Wake Up to Sleep helps patients through their journey, and helps them maximize adherence. This benefits the patient, but it also benefits the physician, the HME provider and the payer.", "Finally, on the intellectual property front, we were just designated by an independent IP firm, Intellectual Asset Management, as the leading global company in the Asia Pacific region with, in their words, \"world-class IP functions and strategies and strong IP protection.\" So ResMed is seen by them as a truly global IP player committed to asserting its IP rights. We've demonstrated this by defending and protecting our intellectual property and our solid R&D investments over the years, with lawsuits against both APEX and BMC.", "Let me wrap up with this. Our respiratory medical market is no longer just about selling equipment to treat sleep-disordered breathing. It's about forming partnerships with our customers and offering full-service solutions for patients, providers, physicians and payers to help manage outcomes of chronic disease. This solutions approach applies in our core market of sleep-disordered breathing, but it also applies in our growing Respiratory Care business, as well as in our fast-growing cardiorespiratory business. For these 3 horizons of growth, the combination of our world-leading quality flow generators, as well as the most comfortable and effective patient interface systems on the planet, as well as easy-to-access, robust and actionable software solutions, makes ResMed the leading value proposition for our customers. We have a robust pipeline of new products in both devices, as well as in masks, as well as in future business process innovations that are planned for sleep, Respiratory Care and cardiology.", "We are laser-focused on bringing these innovative solutions to our market, and we're managing the fundamentals of our business. Those fundamentals are that we continue to improve patients' quality of life, we continue to prevent disease progression, and we continue to reduce the burden of health care costs for critical, chronic diseases, such as sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and heart failure.", "Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter were $357.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 4%. Income from operations for the quarter was $96.9 million, an increase of 20% over the prior-year quarter. And net income for the quarter was $80.9 million, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.56 for the quarter, again, an increase of 14% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 63.7%, an increase of 230 basis points compared to Q1 FY '13.", "On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable currency movements, favorable product mix and manufacturing improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $101.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved to 28.3%, compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of $0.28 for fiscal year 2014.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.4 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. While in constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 9%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 8%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million.", "Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, compared to the prior-year quarter effective tax rate of 21.6%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rates associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $201.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $156.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our APAP and bilevel devices. Masks and other sales were $112.9 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting a very competitive market, particularly in the nasal and pillow segments.", "For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $103.2 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Masks and other sales were $53 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%.", "Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 4%, while Masks and other also increased by 4%.", "Cash flow from operations was $90.4 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $17.9 million.", "Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 432,000 shares for consideration of $21.1 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 4.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program.", "We plan to repurchase at least 2 million shares during fiscal year 2014.", "In addition to the buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter was $616 million, and at September 30, total assets stood at $2.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion.", "I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is Andrew Goodsall with UBS.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Could I, perhaps, just dig in a little bit to the U.S. flow generators, of course, and just ask you to clarify your comments or elaborate on your comments around volume and price? You mentioned it being weaker sort of in volumes or disruption, I think, through the bidding process?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Andrew, so there was some temporary distraction that we talked about from the CB 2 rates that we saw in Q1. The Americas' flow generators growth was 5% year-on-year, which is in the middle of that 4% to 6% range that we think is around that. So reasonably solid growth from us, but in looking at our partners, our HME's business and working with them, we noticed some distraction in, as we said, the contracts from the winners, the subcontracting from the nonwinners and the relationships that have to happen in terms of getting both prescriptions and referrals for patients who were on the replenishment programs for -- who transferred from nonwinners to winners. So all that together caused some temporary distraction during the quarter, and we think that's had some effect on the flow generator growth of the market. And we did reasonably well, I think, in terms of holding our share in a pretty tough quarter for that, where we hit 5%.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just when we look at that 5%, can you elaborate any further on mix, on what was price versus volume? Because you have spoken to the impact of price on the group before?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. So I mean, as we talked about on our last call in the intervening period, around 5% to 7% is the sort of year-on-year price reductions that we've seen. If you remember, last call, we talked about 4% to 6%. So that's a delta of 100 basis points. We think that is temporary and associated with the distraction that happened particularly in the U.S. market. And that 5% to 7% can possibly go back to the 4% to 6%. And we think that will happen as the distraction clears. So without, Andrew, breaking out the specifics of exactly what unit volumes are, which we never do here, and we just talk about revenue growth, that 5% number has sort of all those factors weighed into it.", "Operator", "Our next question is Ben Andrew with William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "The question I guess, for me, first off, is talk a little bit about the revenue that you might be getting from ventilators and ventilatory kind of masks in the quarter in the United States? And kind of break that out, if you can, to give us a kind of raw sleep number, if that's relevant. And then second, just on the currency side, for Brett, if rates hold steady, what do you expect for the quarter and the year?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So I'll take the first part and Brett will take the second. But it will be a quick answer, Ben, we're not going to break out Respiratory Care versus sleep. We're just going to keep flow gens versus masks. Brett, do you want to take the second part?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, I do. I mean, the currency impact obviously benefited on the gross margin with the currency this quarter. And if I look -- if you look through from Q1 into Q2, I still think we'll see some favorable benefits there, and I'd estimate probably -- it's probably going to be in the order of 70 basis points, if currencies hold. Go in [ph] with caution, as all these crept up a bit over the quarter. If you looked in -- for the gain in the Q2, Q3, then you'd see something like half of that 70 basis points reversing back into -- in Q3. So we're going a long way out in terms of predicting on currencies. But if you think about it, Q2 will still see some favorable benefits from currency, then if you watch into Q3, that'd probably, on a sequential basis, reverse a little bit. But looking -- kind of underlying theme of favorability from currency movement, I think we're still going to see that play out on the bottom line in the next few quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question is David Low with Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just touching on masks. I mean, mask resupply and the growth in the number of masks per patient has been a big trend in recent years. I was wondering if you could, one, comment on that; and two, just comment on whether you're seeing much brand change or seen patients changed the mask model they use once they already establish the user of CPAP?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, David. The mask resupply has been, and will continue to be, a strong element of growth long-term for the industry. We partnered very closely, particularly in the U.S. market, with our customers to help drive replenishment programs, really, over the last 3, 5 years, and even beyond that in terms of helping them access their patients, understand adherence rates, understand the importance of that for keeping the patients out of hospital, saving money for the health care system. And that is good for the patient, it's good for the payer and it's good for the provider. So there's a good incentive for all the parties involved. And we've seen that grow really well, as you have, over the quarters. We think that trend will absolutely continue and we will be a part of it. Clearly, in Q1, we did not grow as fast as we'd like to in the nasal and -- particularly, the nasal category but also somewhat in the pillows category. With the launch of the Swift FX Nano, we're back on the front foot in the nasal category. And that's got an S-curve to go up. But as I said in my opening remarks, we have 3 great masks coming out across the categories over the next 3, 6, 9 months. And we believe that those will get us on the front foot for the new patient setup. On the second part of your question about switching patients, masks tend to be like those really comfortable pair of jeans or those really comfortable pair of shoes where it's hard to get someone to change. And if they change, they often buy the same pair of jeans or the same pair of shoes that they were wearing before. And it's difficult to get patients to switch. We think that fundamental is still there. And that's why it's all the more important for us to get these great new masks out and get back on the front foot for new patient setup because there's a trailing revenue opportunity and a trailing opportunity to really help the health care system by keeping those patients with masks for their lifetime.", "Operator", "Our next question is Saul Hadassin with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Mick, just a question on -- you mentioned the temporary disruption that you've seen post company, can you talk to how long you think that disruption's likely to last?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Saul. Yes, it's a temporary distraction in the U.S. market associated with CB2, right? So the U.S. market, which is 50% of the global, it's within that 25% that's [indiscernible] as Medicare. That temporary distraction -- how long is a piece of string? We don't have 100% knowledge on how long it'll take, but we believe it's a matter of months. It's not a matter of weeks. But it's not a matter of quarters. This is a matter of months and we think the U.S. customers have been dealing with this for, now, 90 -- across 20, we're talking about 110, 114 days now. It's not new to them, we've been partnering with them over this period. They know what the challenges are and they're working hard at getting all the paperwork sorted out, getting the subcontracts sorted out, getting the new prescriptions, getting the patients on their databases and working with them. And we are partnering with them -- as we said, with things like the Brightree to make it single order entry, single approach to 1 health care infomatic system to be able to order and resupply. So we think that, over the next number of months, we'll be able to help them through that process, and we're pretty confident in that. Jim, I don't know if you want to add a couple of comments, Jim Hollingshead, who is our President of the Americas, might add a couple of comments. He's closer to this.", "James Hollingshead", "Sure. I mean, to give you guys a sense of the scale of it, roughly half of competitive bid to contracts were won by HMEs who did not have physical facilities in the place where they wanted, right? And so as Mick referred to in the opening comments, that means that there's a lot of subcontracting arrangements that have to be worked out. And so if you just think that side of it alone -- just think of the contracts that had to be set up -- and the subcontracting model is actually new, for the most part, in the HME world. So there's a big administrative burden. Once you've figured out a model, you've got a lot of paperwork you've got to do and you've got arrangements, you have to set up around who owns the inventory and how does it get shipped and things like that. It creates an extra burden on top of, and parallel to, the reimbursement cuts. And so, how long will it take to work through? We see people working through it already. Our customers are very good business people. They have historically shown real resilience in dealing with administrative burden created by both government payers and, well, by Medicare and private payers. So we think we seen working through it now and we think it's probably months and not weeks, but it's not an all year thing. We think they'll clear it and we think they're working through it right now.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Again, just a follow-up question for Brett. Just wanted to ask where you are in terms of manufacturing production out of Singapore and where you think that might get to over the next 12 months or so?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, we're around the 60% mark. We're a little bit more on the Flow Gens, a little bit less on the Mask, but you can sort of blend it around the 60%, And I think, as we said before, I think we just progressively kind of lift that as our production increases. So, also, we predict exactly where we'll be, but that will certainly become a larger percentage of our manufacturing over time.", "Operator", "Our next question is Steve Wheen with JPMorgan.", "Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just on your rest-of-world numbers and Asia Pacific you referred to as being lumpy. Could you sort of give it a little bit more color as to what's happening there, and in particular, your reference to Japan? What is going on in that market?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, thanks for the questions, Steve. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Robert Douglas", "The Japan market has always been lumpy for us. Probably you're aware we've got just a few large customers there that run very significant home care businesses, and they replenish their fleet periodically. Tracking the underlying patient numbers and the whole progression of the sleep business there is progressing well. But order, timing and that just meant that we were in a low part of the lumpy run in Japan. We're very confident of the business there. We've got great relationships with our customers and our teams are working well together in serving those markets. That was really the main issue. The other smaller markets in Asia-Pac all did pretty well and we saw good growth through the emerging markets in there, but they're not yet material enough to show up on these numbers.", "Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just also on France, the formalization of that, I guess, compliance regime. What sort of response are you seeing from the buyers in that market?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Okay, Steve. So we're 110 days in, and we think it's months away on CB2 lineup. We're 23 days in to the French announcement of the telemonitoring, and so 3 weeks -- Anne Reiser, who's our President of Europe, is all across this. She's actually our previous President of France, and ran that business since we hired her from Medtronic for almost a decade in sales and laying it [ph], so she knows the French market intimately. And we have good relations with both the authority and excellent relationships with our customers in France. And we have seen this coming and have been planning for it. We have had great learning from our U.S. market, with EasyCare Online now becoming the leader in healthcare informatics for the sleep disorder breathing space, and we have been able to scale that business very well over the last number of years in the U.S.", "So we have the systems, the tools and the scalable capabilities that we have now taken, literally, to within the country of France and availability now across the European Union. So it's early days. We think the customers are starting to get to grips around it and understanding how to work with us. We think it's going to be a benefit for the S9 order set, for the S9 order set with wireless capabilities and for our EasyCare Online solution in France. But, Steve, it's too early days to say how quickly that S-curve will start to happen, but the starting gun just went off.", "Operator", "Our next question is Matthew Prior with Bank of America.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mick, just a question, just peeling back the layers on CB a little bit further, the 100 basis points of discounting or price pressure that you saw since the last update. Can you give us a sense as to whether that was pressure from private insurers or payers? Or is that driven more from a competitive element, given that volumes are depressed from the distraction factor and various manufacturers fighting for volume?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Matthew, we don't have visibility into the exact per-customer, per-payer knowledge of our customers and so what we do is look at it as a portfolio. Clearly, globally, we saw 100 basis points with the 5% to 7% year-on-year price declines. So there's some impact there, but breaking it out between public and private is very high. What we know are the facts. The facts are that CB2 was announced in February, and went into play in July 1, and that's the main impact that's happened across that payer portfolio. There have been very minor changes in private payers that are not out of the ordinary in and what was happening over the last, not just 5 quarters, but 5 years. So I'm affected by CB or CB1 or CB2. So I'd say that you could deduce that, primarily, price changes were driven by CB2, but we don't have true visibility into it. So it's an assumption, but a pretty good one, based upon the data that we have in hand.", "Matthew Prior - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just a follow-up question, I guess, for them all. Have you seen any change in competitive behavior, to the extent that, again, lower volumes from the distraction factor? Are all various manufacturers still behaving in the same manner which they've behaved, and that it gets around 1 in previous near quarters, given this backdrop of low-volume growth?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, look, I think the pricing behavior has been pretty steady in that 5% to 7% range. I mean, clearly, the new product introduction behavior is that there have been a number of new products introduced by, primarily, our 2 major competitors. Without going into detail, we talked about the nasal category and the pillows category being where they are looking to enter and the customers are sampling those products. We're very confident that not only the Quattro Air's success but Swift FX Nano's great start. And without going into detail, the pipeline that we have coming in the next 3, 6 to 9 months will get us back on the front foot for that first-time setup. So if I was to summarize competitive behavior, I'd say it's about innovation and it's about competition through small, acquired and more comfortable, and better for the patient. Because everyone is starting to realize that adherence is the outcome that matters. That's what saves money for the payer, it's what saves money for the employer and it's what benefits the patient directly each night. That level of competitive behavior of innovating on value, is something that we think is healthy for the industry, but we also think plays to our strong suit over the last couple of decades, and something that we are absolutely confident we can get back on the front foot.", "Operator", "Our next question is Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can we spend a moment on gross margins? Which were pretty spectacular this quarter. How sustainable is that? And what drove almost 100 basis point uptick sequentially?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. I mean, the big one, sequentially, would have been FX impact. So, sequentially, that contributed around 90 basis points. So you think on that, that's basically most of that expansion, if you like. I mean, but if you're still looking at trend buys, we're still getting product mix benefits and things like CPAP to APAP, the Respiratory Care business, all those provide, if you like, sort of a bit of tailwind for us on the gross margin. And some geographic mix, there's some benefit around geographic mix this time around, which -- generally, we probably don't get to the same magnitude we got this time. So there's a few things playing out. The other one is on -- I mean, we're working really hard in the manufacturing and the cost outside of the business as well. And you're seeing that sort of manifest pretty consistently now through the gross margin, and we're absolutely committed to those programs. So, again, you'll see them flowing through as well. And what we're looking to do is -- and you've probably seen it here in the last year or 2 is really do enough through the product mix, through manufacturing logistics to offset the ASP decline.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, now I know you don't like to give revenue guidance, but given all of the pushes and takes that are happening in the first quarter, and quite frankly, the constant currency growth rate which is a meaningful step down from where you have been, can you comment on what you think your revenue may grow at, even if it's a range, for 2014?", "Michael J. Farrell", "No, Joanne, we don't give guidance on revenue. I'll reiterate our market guidance, that we believe that the global market will grow at 6% to 8%, Flow Generators will grow at 4% to 6%, and Masks will grow at 8% to 10%.", "Operator", "Next question is David Clair with Piper Jaffray.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I guess, just kind of a bigger picture one for me, but how do you defend your market share from lower-cost manufacturers and kind of the post-competitive bidding environment? At Medtrade that seems like a lot of kind of fringe players who are talking about this as an opportunity to take some share.", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, low-cost competition is nothing new in our industry. It's been around for over a decade. Many of the players at Medtrade are players who have been trying to enter this market and/or other markets. When I say this market, the one you're at, at Medtrade, the U.S. market and/or other markets around the world, for many years. And the way I'd look at it is if supply was unable to enter the Chinese market or the Brazilian market and their levels of focus on quality and cost trade-off, what are their chances in the U.S. market? So I think it comes back to the fundamentals. The fundamentals here are that health care systems are growing at a fast rate, relative to GDP, for every major developed country. And the U.S. is at 18% of its GDP on health care. Most of western Europe is somewhere in the 10% to 12% of its GDP on health care. Every healthcare system around the world is looking for outcomes and value, and that's driven by long-term adherence and reduction of cost with improvement of quality of life of the patient. We have focused very closely on this, and every new product we bring to market, every new solution we bring to market, looks to take cost out of the system and improve adherence rates for the patient, and reduce the long-term costs for payers and for employers. So, in that environment, with all that going on, I don't think a low-cost solution that has low value has a great opportunity to get into the market. We have great value, our products, at good value prices. So this is happening on a global scale. But I guess you were in the U.S. at Medtrade, maybe I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead to give some detail on what's happening in the U.S. market with those new entrants.", "James Hollingshead", "Well, the first thing -- I think it's a great question and I completely agree with Mick's answer. But if I just think, with our customers, right? The basic equation for our customers is they need products to work. So they need to be able to easily set up a patient. They need to be able to track the compliance of that patient, make sure the patient gets compliance and then create a resupply model. And so the better the product works, the better off they are. And our products work better than other products on the market. We have the best products on the market. Most of the low-cost sort of Asian entrants are producing products that really are not in that class. They don't work that well. They create cost at setup, they create lower compliance rates, et cetera. It's not a very good value proposition. Having said that, we're very mindful. I mean, we're watching the competitive set. And the key thing for us, over time, is to be able to continue to innovate with great product, which we have a great track record of doing, right? So that's it. Now, one of the things we found, and I was actually going to suggest we might turn to Dave to comment is the other issue was around our intellectual property. So, in this space, intellectual property is very strong. And as you guys know, we've defended our intellectual property against a couple of Asian entrants. And that's another way we defend. But I think that the basic way we defend is we have the great products that work that create more revenue for our customers.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, it's a good suggestion. Dave, you want to address the IP side and also to APEX and BMC deal?", "David Pendarvis", "Sure. So the key here is, when people come in to compete and they compete with using our intellectual property, we're not going to let it happen. So, whether that's a small competitor or whether it's a large competitor, we intend to enforce our intellectual property. And that's a different question from a small competitor who comes in and tries to compete using their own R&D, which obviously they've got to get off their own merit. But we're not going to hesitate to continue to enforce our intellectual property against market entrants who want to use the innovation of our hard working employees. And that's something we're continuing to fight with APEX and BMC on. We expect to continue to win those battles. And then at the same time, we expect to be able to be prepared to launch them if we need to. We prefer to see competitors respect our intellectual property and battle on the field. But if we need to battle in court, we won't hesitate to do that.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "And then in terms of the temporary distraction that you guys saw during the quarter, how would you -- would you kind of say that things started out badly in early July and it kind of got progressively better as the quarter rolled on or was it just kind of depressed throughout the quarter?", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, we have daily conversations with our customers. It's hard to get a read on this at that level of detail, but what I can say is the temporary distraction is receding, and it's a question on how fast it recedes. We're 111, 114 days in. It's better than 100 days in, it's better than 90 days in. And it's going in the right direction and we believe it will resolve over a matter of months. The exact kinetics of it, during the quarter, is something that we just don't have visibility to. But the needle is moving in the right direction.", "Operator", "Our next question is Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wondering, in bilevels, whether you can talk to some of the initiatives you're doing to perhaps broaden the channel and the class of patients that use those products.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, absolutely. And we are very focused on our VPAP ST-A, our VPAP COPD and across our pipeline in the COPD space. So that's the first market that we have huge opportunities for our bilevels. The VPAP COPD product was just launched in the end of Q4. So it's initial part of its S-curve. It involves some interaction through the pathway, with the sleep lab, where we have excellent channel access and channel control. And we have our VPAP Tx titration devices available in sleep labs across the country, and so we're really excited about the opportunities in COPD. Secondly, in the bilevel side, long-term, there's a huge opportunity in heart failure. And as you saw, we talked about our European growth being very strong during the quarter. That is helped by the fact that we are running SERVE-HF in France, Germany, the Nordics, as well as the U.K., as well as sites outside Europe. But we're seeing a halo effect from that trial, in the cardiorespiratory space. So, the order set CS product, which is an adaptive servo-ventilation product, an extension of those bilevels, saw some incredible growth. Not just during Q1, but over the last number of quarters. That is a long S-curve, and as we get to the end of results from SERVE-HF, which is mid-2015, there could be an inflection point in really accelerating those cardiorespiratory sales. So I'd summarize, Ian, by saying we've got great initial movement on our S9 bilevels, but there's a heck of a lot of runway ahead for us, particularly in the cardiorespiratory space.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "For my second question, can we -- just changing topics to DMEs. Just wondering, if you look at your U.S. business and breaking the DMEs into some of the large nationals, and then obviously you've got the regionals and then some of the smaller single-person operator. If you look at, say, your business last year and then projecting your business -- maybe not this year, but maybe another year out -- to what extent do you see the percentage of your business changing across those sort of various classes of DMEs, is it going to be material or is it going to be relatively gradual?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. We have good relationships with all those segments of customers from large nationals to regionals, to mom and pops. As to the exact change of it over time, I'm going to hand it to Jim Hollingshead for some thoughts there. Jim?", "James Hollingshead", "Thanks, Mick. The consolidation has been a gradual tectonic move in the channel over the last several years. And I think it will continue at that. Logically, you might expect a little bit of acceleration to consolidation because of CB2, but right now, we're not seeing a massive step change on that basis. And bear in mind, too, that DME is such a local business, that in many cases the local setup shall still be done by DMEs who are now subcontracting, right? So I continue to see it as a more gradual movement.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Partnerships like our partnership with Brightree really help the regionals. We've got EDI partnerships which really helped the nationals. We've got PCP awareness which helps the mom and pops, the regionals and the nationals. So we're willing to partner across the segments and across the categories of customers and products, and we see it as a pretty solid and steady move going forward, would be my summary there.", "Operator", "Our next question is Dan Hurren with UBS.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "We've noticed, when we're talking to the market, that there's a range of deals out there -- as we'd expect for sort of discounts of volumes and those sorts of things -- just wondering how they impact the P&L over time, and the other discounts. Upfront or is there a count-back? Does a customer have to do a certain volume before they get the rebate? So will that hit the P&L later on? Just wondering how that flows through over time.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Brett, you want to talk about how we count for our deals?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "I mean, they'll be a combination of all those, Dan, really. And on things like volume rebate and so on, what you do there is you have to be -- it's pretty dynamic in terms of estimating where you think volume is going to be. And then if we think they're going to hit those, then we certainly accrue as we go. So it's not like you're just going to get lumped with them all of a sudden. That will be spread out through the course of the year or whenever the volume contract is over. And then, of course, you have to make a call on what you think's really sticking and what you think that particular customer will achieve in terms of volumes.", "Dan Hurren - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So, I guess what I'm trying to understand is that are we seeing sales today that will actually result in lower sales when the rebates gets headed back in future periods.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "No. No, because we'd be accruing or offsetting an accrual for that rebate as we go.", "Operator", "Our next question is Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.", "Jeffrey Chu", "This is Jeff filling in for Jason. Wanted to switch gears a bit and ask about the termination of the distribution agreement with CareFusion, which I think you announced about this time 1 year ago. First off, is this timing correct? And secondly, I was hoping you'd quantify the U.S. Flow Generator business during the quarter that were from products that were part of this distribution agreement. I'm just trying to understand the impact over the next several quarters, as you anniversary this termination of this agreement.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Jeff, the distribution agreement with CareFusion was immaterial 1 year ago, and it remain immaterial now. How we're distributing the Stellar range of products which were involved in that agreement is that we have our own respiratory account managers across the U.S. market, which is where that bill is focused. And our respiratory account managers and our respiratory clinical specialists, who are part of our core sales force, have picked up this product. And we did better in our first quarter with our team selling our product than another team trying to sell our product over 1 whole year. So we're seeing some good momentum with Stellar, which has done incredibly well in France and Germany, where it was primarily designed for. But some really good upside opportunities that have come to us in the U.S. But, particularly, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, Stellar is a great product in the Americas geography, for Brazil, where we see the need for home care ventilation. And in some of those emerging markets, our products that are in the value space in respiratory care, have a great opportunity in that geography. So, in the Americas, I'd say one of the best geographic opportunities is right there in Brazil. But here in the U.S., we've taken over that distribution and we've started to move pretty well in it. And there's more, as I said in my opening remarks, in this market, through the end of fiscal '14, we're going to see some very interesting platform launches in the respiratory care space.", "Operator", "Our next question is Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "One on mix and one on the overall U.S. market. On mix, I know you don't tend to give mix on Flow Generators, but certainly, APAP over CPAP has been a driver. It seems that, that was a driver in gross margin in this quarter as well. So I'm wondering if you can just give us an update on the runway there is still left in that mix shift as we move more towards APAP over CPAP.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, so we won't break it out, Anthony. But what I'll say is that, with 35% of the diagnoses in the U.S. market being home sleep testing, pretty much every prescription that comes from a home sleep test requires some type of APAP device. And so there's a sort of good relationship between us. It's not necessarily one for one, because physicians get to see products like the S9 order set and get to love it and want to use it for many of their patients and prescribe it for [indiscernible] from the lab as well as from HST. But if you're looking for an indicator, that may be one that can help you in your calculations for working the downstream split between APAP and CPAP. But one thing remains, is that there is a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP. Why? Well, of course there's the HST trend in the U.S. market. But if you look at other markets around the world, APAP, and particularly the S9 order set, has gained share because it's better for patients. It adjusts during the night, it adjusts night to night and it is very good long-term care. And so we're seeing good outcomes from that. There's people focused more on the outcomes and the value of therapy. We're seeing products like the S9 order set get more and more attention.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then just on the U.S. market, just going back to reimbursement trends overall. I know in the past you've touched on private reimbursement relative to CMS. Is there an update as to where they stand relative to CMS at this point? And perhaps, again, as you look forward, is there any indication of direction or where private pays may be going?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, sure, Anthony. Well, as I said earlier in the Q&A here, CMS announced CB2 in February, it went into effect in July and we saw some effect in Q1. But private payers, during the last 90 days, did what they've done over the last 9 years, which is the steady reductions over time, by geography, by state. There's been business as usual as we look across the private payer space within the U.S. market.", "Operator", "We are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over Mick Farrell for his closing remark.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for coming and listening in on this call. I'd like to say thanks to our investors, to the analysts and our many customers who listen to this conference call. Importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a special thank you to the 4,000-strong global ResMed team, from Asia-Pac, Europe and the Americas, for your hard work, dedication and continued excellence. Together, we are improving, literally, millions -- multiple millions of lives in respiratory medicine, 1 breath at a time. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Earnings Call. My name is Sherry and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "Before we begin, ResMed has asked me to remind you that during this call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development or new markets for the company's products. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is included in the ResMed SEC filings which are available on the company's website. (Operator Instructions)", "Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO, and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.", "Michael Farrell", "Thanks, Sherry, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I will review the highlights of our fiscal Q2 and then I will hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in some more detail.", "So first the financial summary. Global revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 grew by 2% year-on-year to $384 million, that\u2019s up 1% on a constant currency basis. Europe, Asia, and rest of the world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $178 million, which is 5% on constant currency terms. Americas revenue decreased by 2% to $207 million. We believe the long-term global growth rate for our industry remains in the 6% to 8% range.", "Net income for the quarter increased 11% to $86.6 million. GAAP EPS increased by 13% to $0.60 for the quarter, while hybrid EPS which includes the amortization of intangibles, was $0.61 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from the global team.", "Let me start with the Americas, where clearly we had some external headwinds and where we were not satisfied with the results. The Americas had a challenging quarter with overall sales decreasing by approximately $5 million year-on-year, which was 2% on a year-on-year basis. It's interesting to note that it was approximately $5 million increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis which is a 3% sequential quarter-to-quarter increase.", "Sales revenues from masks were flat year-on-year while flow generator sales revenue declined by 5% year-on-year. It's also of note that we were up against some very tough prior year comparisons in both those categories. Float generators were up 16% in Q2 fiscal 2013 and masks were also up 16% 12 months ago in Q2 fiscal '13. However, the result was not solely a reflection on these comparables. I will walk through the two key areas of impact in this regard. Firstly, competitive bidding, and secondly, competitor actions in the marketplace.", "So first, on competitive bidding. U.S. market dynamics were challenging in Q2 and remain challenging today as we have been discussing. The distraction we saw in Q1 continued throughout Q2. As we had indicated it would on our core. And our customers have grappled with the U.S. reimbursement changes that went into effect in July for Medicare patients, which is a CB2. As we discussed on our Q1 call, winners and losers of competitive bids adjusted their market strategies and structures. And this temporary distraction caused a net reduction in sales volumes for the quarter. Patients are navigating their way through the new HME landscape while HME providers simultaneously try to ensure that patients they are picking up meet their reimbursement and documentation criteria. This occasionally causes what are so called orphan patients, who are not able to be serviced by the old or a new HME. And this has reduced net volumes for the quarter.", "This also impacts new patients as winning HMEs establish a presence in territories through subcontracts, acquisitions of assets or Greenfield [indiscernible]. As we work through these challenges with our U.S. HME customers, we continue to believe that this interruption in volume is temporary. Customers are developing new business models and footprints and finding ways to serve both new and existing patient needs. While it is hard to predict the future precisely, we continue to think that there is a number of months before the market stabilizes. The key signs we see indicating that this the case are that the distraction is beginning to recede in some leading indicators in the U.S. market.", "First, we continue to see new patient growth in the U.S., in PCP visits, in elective procedures, and in referrals to sleep physicians. Second, many of our U.S. customers are picking up existing and new patient volume through asset purchases and referral pathway development. The other key area I want to walk through in regard to competitor actions. We saw impact from our competitors in Q2 in addition to the external market conditions. On the product introduction front we saw strong competition in both the nasal mask and the nasal pillows categories. Product introductions from our major competitors have reversed some portion of the share gains that we have had in these two categories over the last number of years.", "Competitive pricing, particularly in the CPAP category, also influenced our results. And we are establishing appropriate value pricing premiums to ensure that we get back to taking share in that category too.", "Let me go into a little more detail on product introduction. We are executing to our plan that we talked about in our Q1 call to bring a strong product pipeline to the market. This product innovation dynamic is returned to the competitive product cycle that we have demonstrated for over two decades in this market. We are confident that our new product offerings and our pipeline can address this challenge. It is a game we have played before and we know that we can win. Last quarter we said we would launch three new masks throughout this fiscal year and we are executing well against that plan.", "At the beginning of last week, we launched the AirFit P10, our latest nasal pillows system. This is our quietest mask to date. It is 50% quieter than the market category leader, our existing Swift FX. The AirFit P10 is literally whisper quiet. It is also 50% lighter, weighing in at just 1.6 ounces. And finally, its revolutionary vent technology which we call quite air, gently diffuses the air, minimizing disturbance to both the patient and their bed partner. After only two weeks in the market, the AirFit P10 has received many positive reviews in social media, on the online stores, and from patients who have tried the product with our U.S. HME customers. I personally have been using this product for the last two months and I got to tell you, it's the most comfortable, quite and effective mask that we have brought to the market.", "Continuing with our announced product innovation plan, we will launch two additional new masks during the balance of fiscal year 2014. We expect them to similarly be well received by patients, providers, physicians and patients. Let me also go into a little more detail on pricing. Clearly the pricing environment is very competitive in the Americas, pricing declines impacted our results across the board in the U.S., but especially in our CPAP product category. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our price premium, category by category, segment by segment. And we will ensure that we are appropriately positioned reflecting both the current market realities and the superior value proposition that our products deliver to our patients and to our providers.", "Importantly, I want to let you know that for competitive reasons, we are not going to announce the details of our average selling price changes. Whether global or by region, or by product segment. The reason behind this is that one, other market participants do not publically reveal their amount of detail, and two, we are concerned this information may affect us in the marketplace. In short, we don\u2019t believe doing so is in the best interests of our shareholders.", "Finally, on the Americas and before turning to Europe, Asia and rest of the world, there are a few bright spots in the Americas results for Q2. We saw good growth of our Adapt SV and Stellar devices, reflecting our emerging growth in both cardiology and respiratory care markets. The Stellar received regulatory approval in Brazil during the quarter and we are encouraged about the prospect for respiratory care in the Latin America market over the coming years.", "The VPAP COPD, which is the first and only device with an FDA clearance with an indication for use to treat COPD, is gaining traction in respiratory care. And finally, accessories sales for both flow generators and for masks was solid, reflecting growth in the installed base. And the fact that many of our customers despite competitive bidding continued to drive an increased their focus on patient replenishment programs.", "So now I am going to switch to on our review on Europe where we saw good growth with solid performances in many countries, including European dealer network, the U.K., Switzerland and both our German dealer business as well as our German homecare business. Two of the main drivers of growth in Europe were our respiratory care and cardiology markers, including in particular the products, Stellar and AutoSet CS, which both produced good growth. It's interesting to note that in Europe plus Asia and rest of the world, our flow generator growth year-on-year was plus 6% constant currency. We also contribution from our recently released mask products in that region, the Quattro Air and the Nano.", "In France, the previously announced telemonitoring requirements went into effect October the first, right at the start of the quarter. We believe this development started to help and will help grow our share in flow generators in the region. The emerging focus on healthcare informatics in France and throughout Europe as it grows, plays to ResMed's strength. We are seeing interesting in EasyCare Online solutions both within France but now outside France in various parts of Europe, where customer's recognize EasyCare Online is efficient and provides adherence benefits and high quality. It also has incredibly strong and robust data protection that is increasingly important for these markets and also for our global customers.", "We continued to expand our reach in Eastern Europe during the quarter, building on our recent acquisition that we announced in Q1 in Poland. In December we acquired Unimedis, which is a Czech Republic based distributor of sleep disordered-breathing and respiratory care products. The Czech Republic has a population of over 10 million and its healthcare spending ranks just below the general European level and has more physicians per capita than most other EU countries. This acquisition allows us to drive market growth in emerging markets opportunity in Eastern Europe, in Poland and now Czech Republic across sleep disordered-breathing, homecare ventilation, as well as cardiology markets.", "In the Asia Pacific region, sales growth was light. Although we were encouraged by progress in our cardiology sales in Japan, overall sales to our Japanese customers were not as strong as we would have hoped. We expect Asia-Pac to be stronger in the second half of this fiscal year as patient flow remains solid in the region overall. And we are partnering with our customers in the regions to do so. We saw good growth in China in Q2 and we remain confident in the long-term opportunities of emerging markets in Asia-Pac, as well as the more established markets in the region of Japan and Australia, New Zealand.", "Turning to R&D. In addition to the patient interface product development that we mentioned on our press release earlier in the call, we are also making good progress in our respiratory care pipeline. We are on track to launch our next generation respiratory care platform in Europe during this fiscal year, with a subsequent launch into the Americas and then into Asia-Pac. We have a strong R&D team focused on bringing meaningful innovation to the market and the benefit to patients, physicians and providers in this space. It includes the diseases of COPD, neuromuscular disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and beyond. We are very encouraged by the results of the first patients who are being put on this next generation respiratory care product and we will go into further detail in the coming quarters.", "In short, horizon two of our three horizons growth strategy, which is this respiratory care market, is lining up for growth in Europe and then the Americas and Asia-Pac. Watch this space.", "Let me close with this. We remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain underpenetrated and absolutions provide symptomatic relief of patients while slowing the progression of key chronic diseases, while saving money to the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions, we have the right people, and we have the right strategy to succeed. We are confident that we will continue to do so. Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer. Brett, over to you.", "Brett Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the December quarter was $394.3 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 1%. Income from operations for the quarter was $105 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, and net income for the quarter was $86.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter.", "Gross margin for the December quarter was 64.7%, an increase of 290 basis points compared to Q2 FY '13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines. Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 65%, assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structure.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. While in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, R&D expenses increased by 5%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.7% compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%. Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in our product pipeline, tempered somewhat by the depreciation of the Australian dollar as the majority of our research and development is undertaken in Australia.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 20.8%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will also be in the vicinity of 21%.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall, sales in the Americas were $206.6 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter. While sales outside the Americas totaled $177.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $88.7 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $117.9 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other also increased by 1%.", "Cash flow from operations was $84.2 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $19.7 million, while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $18.6 million.", "Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for consideration of $74 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 2.6 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $537 million, and at December 31, total assets stood at $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.6 billion.", "I'll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "I actually have two. The first one happens to be, how much of the foreign exchange uptick year-over-year is associated with foreign exchange.", "Michael Farrell", "Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "How much of the earnings?", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Well, no. I mean your -- the gross margin was up well over 200 basis points year-over-year, almost 300 basis points. And I am just wondering how much of that is from foreign exchange.", "Brett Sandercock", "On the margin, yes. So on the year-over-year, Joanne, on the FX was about 140 basis points of that.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And that\u2019s mostly related to the Aussie, the Australian dollar?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Predominantly. We have a -- there is a little bit of benefit from the euro but that\u2019s predominantly the Aussie dollar weakening.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then I understand why you don\u2019t want to talk about your pricing paradigm, but can you step back and talk a little bit about what's happening to pricing in the industry?", "Michael Farrell", "Yes, Joanne, I mean they are pretty much the same thing asking what we are doing in pricing, what the industry is doing with pricing. Given that we want to maintain our appropriate value premium over our competitors but ensure that we are competitively priced to make sure we get back to taking share. So specifically within the U.S. market, we are looking at our value premiums and ensuring, based upon the market dynamics that are going on throughout Q1 and as we saw in Q2, to make sure that we get back to taking share across the segments. So we are looking at pricing on a category by category basis and SKU by SKU basis and the segment by segment basis, based upon how the customers look at it. But to qualify that, whether by industry or by us, we would sort be parallel and it doesn\u2019t make sense to break out either. It's just not in the interests of our shareholders to do so.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Just [indiscernible] a little bit on that. One of the things I am seeing from other companies that have products with competitive bidding is that the other companies around them are dropping prices that they need to respond to. I am going to assume that\u2019s what's going on in your world also.", "Michael Farrell", "Look, Joanne, we are the value premium leader. We don\u2019t generally in our industry move down ahead of the curve. So I think that\u2019s a safe assumption to say and, yeah, it's safe to say that we are more responding on the downward approach and trying to find and elicit the appropriate premium to maintain across each of the SKUs. And we have got pretty good signs behind this and it's really just an adjustment of external dynamics with our internal dynamics to make sure that all makes sense. But the premise does sound like what we have been executing to.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question comes from David Clair of Piper Jaffray.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "So I was just hoping, Mick, in the commentary you talked about a moderating impact to competitive bidding in the quarter. Can you just give us some additional thoughts there? And I know you talked about 6% to 8% global growth, do you think that U.S. grew as a market or did it decline? And when do you think that we should expect ResMed to kind of rebound and put up positive growth in the U.S.", "Michael Farrell", "Yes. I mean clearly in the U.S. market, we talk about 6% to 8% as the long-term growth of this industry. Clearly there is some impacts through competitive biddings. We talked about the patients who get moving from HME A to HME B, you know these last 90 days, that will have some impact on the growth. We don\u2019t have it down to the decimal point, and to your point, it doesn\u2019t make sense to go there. But the leading indicators that we see that -- and we have a lot of data on this and some of it's public. And we have shared that on our latest investor presentation that patient flow to primary care physicians are picking up. Patient flow for elective procedures which are analogous to referrals for sleep-disordered breathing, such as hip and knee replacements, are starting to move up.", "Referrals specifically in our industry to sleep-disordered breathing specialists are starting to move up on the diagnostic front. So all these leading indicators are macro and generally public, and allow us to talk about them. We have many other indicators that we have customer by customer as they buy assets of patients. So they are starting to monetize that asset. Getting the pipe work together. Working with patients to ensure that pipe works is of the standard of the acquiring HME versus the HME who sold the asset, and ensuring that they can get that replenishment revenue and get the patients back on the right care that\u2019s needed to happening there. So they are the sort of what we would call, David, the green shoots of growth that we are seeing on these leading indicators to make us believe that the impact of competitive bidding is beginning to moderate in the market. We are not done but there are green shoots starting to appear which, as we look forward the next 12, 24, 36 months, we see a whole lot of opportunity.", "The change that we often get asked that is, will be it a one month or a three month, or a five month. We don\u2019t know exactly. And so we say it's a number of months for those green shoots to start turning to moderation of the entire market and for us to, as an industry, get back on the growth track. And we think we are well positioned to do that, we are partnering with our HME customers to do that.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the pipeline, I mean obviously you guys have a lot of stuff going on there. Can you give us a sneak peek at Medtrade? Should we expect some material product launches coming up here?", "Michael Farrell", "So David, we don\u2019t give sneak peeks on any trade show. Not one for Medtrade or about trade shows in medicare in Europe or elsewhere. But I will recite what I said, that we have three amazing new masks coming this fiscal year. The first one is out there, the AirFit P10. The other two masks will go on other categories and they are very exciting. Can't give you any details, David. I can tell you that we have a respiratory care next generation platform that has had its first patient on therapy already in Europe, and we are excited about a full product launch of that product before the end of the fiscal year. That I can share with you. But no details on any of the trade shows throughout 2014, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Andrew of William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company", "So let\u2019s see. If we think about volumes and new patients are growing and overall domestic CPAP was down 5%, in the lower side masks were flat. That has to suggest that existing patient volume on masks was -- volume was either negative or modestly positive if price is probably worse this quarter than it had been. Is that a fair way to characterize it?", "Michael Farrell", "Well, Ben, you used a number of different parameters there. What we saw and I think what we said, is that in the quarter there were some volume impacts from competitive bidding. I mean that\u2019s clear. As a patient is moving from HME A to HME B and that asset is picked up, you know if they were on a replenishment cycle that was every three months and then they are changing from HME A to HME B over a three months or a six months process, that maybe one of those masks in terms of the pickup or one of those cushions in terms of the pickup is left out. So that temporary distraction is real for competitive bidding and will have an impact on market price within a particular period of time, for a particular DME.", "But to ramp that up over the 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs out there in the U.S. marketplace, it's really difficult to know exactly, you know precisely pick where that volume change is occurring. But the leading indicators of patient flow into the channel are there. The analogy that we used at JPMorgan last week is it's like you have got a garden hose, where the garden hose is the flow of patients is the water, and the garden hose has got a crimp in it, which is this competitive bidding. And it's a [indiscernible] bend in the curve of the pipe. And we starting to work with our HMEs to uncrimp or unkink that garden hose and the water is starting to flow. So the patients are starting to come through the channel and they will get to an HME. The new HMEs that are establishing in the areas where they have won have to establish referral pathways and pick up those patients. And even established HMEs have to ensure those referral pathways are solid.", "But as we look to the long-term, we see getting back to that 6% to 8% market growth rate as something we will absolutely do. This is not a structural change, it's a temporary change that will allow us to help the customers and get us back to growth.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Mick, I guess my second question would be, as the HME customers obviously have seen their profitability tighten, they are clearly coming back at you guys and asking for concessions. You competitors are responding, you are not going to respond to them more aggressively, you are not going to give us pricing information anymore which I understand. But shouldn\u2019t we assume that this is a more permanent dynamic on the pricing side and that the volume as they come back over the course of time with the new patient flow that the structural growth rate has to be lower than it was before.", "Michael Farrell", "So I will hand to Jim to go in a little more detail on the profitability of the HME customers and then I will come back to talk to your point about long-term and why I think we can get back to the 6% to 8%. Jim?", "James Hollingshead", "Hi, Ben. I don\u2019t think the market dynamic that we are seeing now is a permanent market dynamic. I mean that\u2019s your question. I think what we are seeing, we have been talking internally about how to describe what we see going in the market, and the metaphor that we keep coming back to is, it's like a thunderstorm has passed through town. The storm is through but there is cleanup, right. And so -- and talking to our customers what we are seeing, we have talked about in this call before, is the things that our customers have to go through with doing subcontracting, and a lot of the larger customers are doing acquisitions, and as they do that they are buying a -- they are either buying a business whole or they are buying a list of patients. They then have to figure out how to get those patients in their replenishment systems and so on.", "There is a lot of logistics and administration that is working its way through the HME world right now. There is pricing pressure, there is clearly pricing pressure. And as Joann said earlier, you have seen that in all the competitive bid markets. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason to believe that what's going on right now is just sort of a new normal that will last forever. I think the market is working its way through what we have previously described as distraction. And I think over the next several months, and it makes very difficult to know how long that timeframe is, but over the next several months we will see it stabilize. So, no, I don\u2019t think this kind of challenge is a permanent challenge. I think we have to work our way through it as an industry and we are working with our customers to do that.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company", "Right. And, Jim, what I was trying to get at is that I think the value proposition for a user in a lower reimbursement environment to the HME is more compressed and so they are going to be more price sensitive to the higher end products or to any product, and less willing to step up on the mix side which is a structural change versus the ability you have had in the past to keep moving that mix a little bit higher and holding price as a result. That\u2019s what I am concerned about.", "Michael Farrell", "I think the mix dynamic is still there, Ben, and here is why. The CPAP to APAP mix shift is still going even despite the compounding of the two effects. We talked about competitive bidding and the volume impact, the competitors actions and the pricing impact. So all that hit at once. Yet, still, we see some growth there for us. And as we are partnering with our customers to try and understand how to make that happen, the move to HST is implied. And we said somewhere between 30% to 35% of the tests, the diagnostic tests done in the U.S. were home sleep tests in the last 12 months. That will get to 40% within the next nine months. And it will then go to 45% and up and beyond. And we have said it many times, that the analogy is some markets in Europe, where you are talking about 70%-80% of the test being home sleep tests. This is sort of endpoint.", "That drives volume into the market. It allows more patients to get into the diagnostic channel who man not have gone to a PSG. This is all being driven by the insurance companies and payers but it has a benefit of providing more volume as a long-term. And the positive mix-shift, to your point on pricing, that allows that CPAP to APAP mix shift to happen. Additionally, for ResMed, as we start to launch more of our respiratory care products that we are launching in Europe and also launching in the Americas over the coming year or two, will have a mix shift for ResMed that allows us to move to higher end products. Where ASPs are just higher and there is mix shift from segment A to segment B that is a positive tailwind for us. So that\u2019s why as we look at the market and as we look at our opportunities, we think a 6% to 8% market growth rate makes a whole lot of sense.", "But going from the global macro, I will drill back down to your question which is on the Americas. Jim, do you have any more to add there?", "James Hollingshead", "Yes, thank you, Mick. I just wanted to add one thing to that, Ben, which is, what we are seeing is actually what we have anticipated happening in the market. Which is as HMEs are working through the challenges that reimbursement cuts have posed for them, there is pricing pressure and that makes sense to us, but they are also looking for more efficiencies in their business. And so they are looking to a couple of things. Everybody wants to drive up their compliance rate and that actually works in our favor because our products have higher compliance, both on flow gen and on mask.", "The other thing they are looking to do is to get each patient compliant and then to get them into replenishment programs in the cost effective way. So that\u2019s why you have been seeing us focus on some of the [indiscernible] You have seen us improve EasyCare Online platform. You have seen us with our [indiscernible] subsidiary driving some automation into the business process. And you will continue to see things like that from us over the coming months. We are working with our customers -- you know our products still get a premium. They get a premium because they are better products but we continue to enjoy good position with the customers because we are helping to drive efficiencies into their business. And so we are very bullish on where we are taking our offering in that direction.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Matthew Prior of Bank of America.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a question in regards to the exit trajectory from the quarter. Mick, you spoke about, obviously, this being a question of months not necessarily quarters, in terms of when we see those green shoots having benefit. But in terms of the three months of the quarter can you talk us through, given the last six months of seeing the impact of competitive bidding, was September the darkest month of the six? To give us a sense as to how that line would look over the six months.", "Michael Farrell", "Yes. To determine the exact trajectory of this combines a whole bunch of factors across 4000 to 6000 customers, and as they look at their patient referrals in and as they look at subcontracting, as they look at building facilities, and as they look at developing new organic referral pathway. So to pick down exactly where the nadir is and when the curve starts to move up, is very difficult. And that\u2019s why we are here saying, look, it's going to be a number of months for us to get through this and we don\u2019t know exactly how many. You know by customer of course you have all the dynamics going on, but if customer A buys customer B than one has a 100 percent growth, they are doubling, and the other is going to zero. Yet, the volume remains the same. So putting that across the whole weighted average of our customers is a difficult equation.", "And then you are predicting other market dynamics as to who is going to be better at developing referral models to cardiologists or to new pulmonary referral sources, or within the U.S. market as the development of the accountable care organizations or ACOs, where hospitals and primary care physicians are now working together with shared costs. You have other dynamics of cost and volume that go in on a market-by-market basis. So predicting exactly where the bottom is and how many months it is to see the trajectory moving up is very, very difficult, Matt.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, I guess to clarify, Mick, what I was really after was, do you think that second quarter is the worst that we have seen in terms of all the dynamics going on around price and competitive effect and irrationality out in the marketplace, and behavior of DMEs and disruption of patients finding equipment? Is it just a question of the rate of exit in terms of things get better from here or given the dynamics are still in flux, could we see, obviously, another quarter of weaker performance than what we have seen? I am trying to get a sense as to the dynamics you have seen, how long have they been going on to the extent of could things get worse from here, or is it just a question of the rate of trajectory out of the quarter?", "Michael Farrell", "Yes. You listed about 15 things which we are trying to predict all of them as we go forward. And to say precisely on all those 15, we don\u2019t know. Here is the thing we can control. We can control our new product launch. And we just launched the AirFit P10, which in its first two weeks if flying off the shelf. We will be launching two other new masks between here and June 30 that similarly have huge opportunities for value generation. For patients, providers and for physicians. And we are also launching, I would call a leapfrog next-generation respiratory care system that I might ask Geoff Neilson to talk about some of its value as we have started to get our first patients on therapy in Europe for.", "So we know that we have the pipeline to start delivering and turning to strong growth here, and to get back to share gain in some of the categories like nasal masks and nasal pillows. And then also in the CPAP category with regard to appropriate pricing. So we have got the plan of action ready to go. And I will go back to what I said in the early notes when I said at the start of your question, Matt, which is, it's a number of months for us to get back to that growth trajectory but there a number of bits in play. Some are macroeconomic that we can't control. Some are directly within our control, like delivery of products. And we have done a pretty darn good job over the last two plus decades on that and we plan to execute on that over the coming 6-12 and beyond.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Mick, understood. My second question is in regards to France. You know given the changes to reimbursement there and obviously informatics. Have you seen anything in terms of the second quarter around mask consumption relating to those informatics in France in terms of that shift that has occurred?", "Michael Farrell", "I will hand to Rob Douglas to talk about that France and the HI.", "Robert Douglas", "Yes, thanks, Mick. Matt, the French business has been going well. We are encouraged by the performance of our system, our online system and how we are picking up all the patient numbers and managing the data. And also compiling with all of the privacy rules and that type of thing, which are quite complex throughout Europe. We think that\u2019s performing well. In terms of, other sort of structural changes in terms of mask usage and things like that, it's still too early days to make a comment on that. But we are pretty happy with the way the French business has been going in the light of those changes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Low of Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "If we just switch in to the rest of world [indiscernible] right there. Mick, you began talking about that you think market growth could be 6% to 8% again. Help us understand why rest of world growth, constant-currency growth, I think is 5% versus that 6% to 8%. What's holding back that business or perhaps the market outside the U.S. at the moment?", "Michael Farrell", "Yes. So, David, the line was cutting in and out a little bit, but you were asking about Europe, Asia and rest of the world growth and who to get that to the 6% to 8% range. Look there are many impacts that are -- I mean counties obviously when we say Europe, Asia and rest of the world. We are talking about the other 99 countries we are in other than the U.S. But within those markets there are many different market dynamics. We talked in some detail in the call earlier about Japan being soft in Q1 and also being soft in Q2. We think there is some tailwind for us potentially in Asia Pac as we look to Q3 and Q4. So that has an opportunity to get us back to stronger growth rates and we think that can help get the rest of world number to where it should be.", "Look, I got to tell you, I was incredibly impressed by our European team. We don\u2019t breakdown the particular countries within the Europe or the particular countries within Asia Pac. But there was some really good performances, particularly in Northern Europe, within our teams of partnering with insurance systems. Understanding the total value of the healthcare system and how ResMed takes patients with providers. Takes patients out a hospital, puts them in the home, and treats them more cost effectively and saves money for the healthcare system. And when you have socialized medicine and governments involved in healthcare, as you do in northern Europe, they'd very heavily involved in analyzing all that. So we have a lot of partnerships in the U.K. and Northern Europe that are moving us down that road and we are very excited about it. So as we look to that long-term and talk about 6% to 8% market growth. And do I feel confident that our Europe, Asia, and rest of the world group can achieve in that range, I absolutely do.", "We have got the right strategy, we have got the right people, and they are starting to execute on it. There will always be some lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter but as you look forward over 4, 8, 12 quarters, we can absolutely see our growth being very solid within that range.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks very much. And just coming back to the U.S. Trends in the mix shift through auto setting devices and then bilevel devices. I know you have mentioned it particularly the gross margin, but just wondering with this move to competitive bidding and DMEs being under pressure, are you seeing any sort of pushback towards a basic CPAP where in the past you were seeing a trend to auto setting devices?", "Michael Farrell", "Look, this is all being driven by the payer and insurance companies, right. When they move the market from PSG to HST, they are driving it. And so when the payer establishes a home sleep testing protocol, it's going to require that the device that goes out is an APAP. Because otherwise you have to bring them back into the lab to get them titrated. So payers are generally driving the HST shift. They are also then driving the APAP shift. So that\u2019s just a fact. It's going to happen. The bilevel opportunity is really about a broader opportunity which is about non-invasive ventilation. And the idea there is bringing something that\u2019s been pretty well established in Western Europe, which is using non-invasive ventilation to treat patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome, to bring more of that and to grow that category within the Americas market.", "I am going to ask Geoff Neilson to talk a little bit about our global respiratory care business and how that might apply to allow us to get some of that positive mix shift in our ventilators.", "Geoff Neilson", "So if we take COPD as an example, you know bilevel treatment for COPD in Europe is well established, particularly in Germany and ResMed is competing well in that space. There is a huge opportunity for COPD globally, including in the U.S. But it's somewhat muted by the reimbursement pathways to actually get patients on to therapy. However, on the other side, that has created some larger opportunities around higher-end ventilation products for COPD. And that\u2019s a segment that should really be growing quickly. So that brings me into the our ventilation platform, which can be positioned for COPD in the U.S. and also globally across the range for life-support and ventilation. So our Astro platform, we have started market trials in Europe. So we have had significant number of patients on that device now. It's being incredibly well received. As Mick mentioned there, this is a leapfrog platform that was developed from scratch over the past year and we are looking forward to launching that globally, but certainly in Europe by the end of this fiscal year. And depending on FDA timing and so on, as soon as we have a 510(k) approval, we will route further up our ventilation sales force in the U.S. and start driving into that couple of hundred million dollar market with this product, which is replacing our Elis\u00e9e and VS ranges [ph].", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall of UBS.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Actually, just to take up that point on ventilation. You mentioned it's been growing quickly and I know you don't break it out at the quarter. But could you just characterize it at the quarter? Was it actually growing and did it contribute to growth in this quarter?", "Michael Farrell", "Yes. So Andrew we don\u2019t break out ventilation and we will, as Geoff talked to, it's a material opportunity for us, but not yet by country and by segment a material business that we will break out as yet. But we are very excited about that product launch. And you know over the coming quarter, two or three, we will start to go into more detail as to the product launch and how that moves over time. We are already quite well established respiratory care player in some countries in Europe. So the product will roll into an existing referral and sales channel that we have already developed. In other markets, as Geoff was talking about the U.S. market and some others globally, we are developing the referral channels and the pipeline as well as bringing the product to market. So it's an S curve that will go rapidly in some countries and slowly in other countries. But specially to your question, Andrew, we are not going to break out the details in Q2 but as we look to going forward we will give more details of the products as it's launched in each of the different geographies worldwide.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Okay, and just with the masks, I think going into this quarter, you would have full contribution from the Quattro full face Air and the Swift Nano FX. Obviously from the quarters, there is a lot of noise in the numbers, pretty difficult to understand sort of what traction you're getting. Could you just again characterize what they might have been doing on an underlying basis?", "Michael Farrell", "Yes. So Quattro Air was launched sort of mid-calendar year. So we are in month five or six of that. We are actually seeing in the full face category, we are doing pretty well and Quattro Air is a strong part of that. And we like what Quattro Air is doing and customers seem to like the fact that it's 3.3 ounces and incredibly light on the face for the category of patients, the segment of patients that it's able to treat, the Quattro Air is doing well. Having said that, the Mirage Quattro and the Quattro FX, the other two full face masks we have are also holding share quite well. So we are reasonably comfortable with those.", "The Swift FX Nano has had a good start up, particularly in Europe, Asia and rest of the world. I mean masks were up, 6% headline and 4% constant currency in rest of the world. So the Swift FX Nano has started to have a pull up. But it was launched in the September timeframe in the U.S. and a little later in Europe so we haven't seen as much material contribution from that in the nasal category. But we are looking forward to that over time. But we are also, Andrew, looking very much forward to the next two masks and what contribution they are going to bring as we look forward.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Okay, and just a final bit of housekeeping. Just going to ask the FX contribution to EPS, and I think we got that number here from Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Andrew that was $0.05 this quarter, the EPS impact.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ian Abbott of Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs", "My first one is around share loss in masks. Do you think you're losing share just in new patients or do you think there is some spillover into existing patients?", "Michael Farrell", "So as you know we don\u2019t sell directly to patients so we don\u2019t have any idea as to whether it's a new patient or an existing patient. In the U.S. market we sold to distributors who move that forward. As we look at the temporary distraction from competitive bidding impacting as well as the competitor actions of new product launches, particularly in nasal masks and nasal pillows categories. There is a whole combination of factors going on there. It's very difficult to discern that. And underlying fundamental is that it is difficult to switch existing patients out. So like a comfortable pair of jeans or a pair of shoes that you love wearing, you tend to stick to the same ones. It's difficult to get a patient, particularly something they were every night if they are comfortable and happy. Firstly, you probably don\u2019t want to do it if you are physician or a patient. And then even the provider who might have some margin gain. The margin gain of that versus the margin loss of potentially losing the patient to another HME or not being able to switch the patient and spending the cost to do so, generally means that they are not switched as often.", "Having said that, we believe that the new products, the three new products that we are bringing out this fiscal year, the AirFit P10 and the two others, will allow us to get back to rapid gain of new patients and establish therefore installed base that should be a replenishment for years to come on that basis.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs", "Great, and my second question was around the cost side of things. You have raised your guidance on SG&A from 28% to 29%. R&D, you pushed the guidance just to a straight 8%, previously 7% to 8%. Is that a function of higher investment or is that more a function of lower expected sales outlook? And I suppose if there is, if it's the latter, I'm just wondering how much ability is there to start to trim those expenses and how long would that take?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, Ian, there is rough estimates or a range where we think it will be. So I mean that can easily move around from that number so it's not kind of, probably not the precision that you are thinking about. We have got this pipeline through on product and so on so you can expect R&D will really, I think to some extent a factor of a pretty solid pipeline in R&D that we are undertaking. And also we are taking a foot off in terms of R&D and what we are doing there. And in SG&A we need to contain those. I think we have done a reasonable job and we will continue to make sure we are spending effectively and efficiently. But we will certainly be investing in some of these newer growth areas around respiratory care, around cardiology. Geoff mentioned earlier in terms of ramping up, for example, in the sales force in the U.S. when the time is appropriate to support sales there. So there is a number of those programs or projects that we definitely want to support. But notwithstanding that, clearly we want to continue to leverage on SG&A and make sure we are driving R&D expenditure efficiently. So we will continue to do that. So the short answer, yes, I think there is scope that I think that we can continue to be effective in those areas and drop that benefit to the bottom line.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse", "Mick, just two questions. First one is, I think in your opening remarks you spoke to what was happening on the competitive dynamics on the CPAP side of the business. I assume you were referring to fixed pressure devices. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color as to what you are seeing there, whether it's share loss as opposed to just competitive pricing and just what your response is to that? And the second question is, just with regards to your customer, well, to your DME customers, whether you are actually seeing any consolidation yet, actual closures of particularly small to medium-sized players? Thanks.", "Michael Farrell", "It sounds like a U.S. folks [ph] question. Jim, you want to address that too?", "James Hollingshead", "Sure, I shall. So, yes, the CPAP dynamic that Mick was referring to in the opening comments was about the fix pressure devices. What we are seeing is continued growth in the AutoSet or APAP part of the market. There is a mix shift underway across the whole markets. AutoSet where we continue to do well. In CPAP what we are seeing is increased pricing pressure, especially at the low end. That is a decreasing part of the market. So the low-end CPAP is actually a smaller part of the market than mid-tier CPAP which is, it's about smaller than AutoSet. And that we are seeing more severe pricing pressure at the low-end. So we have lost some share and there is pressure down in that part of the market. And as we said in the opening comment, we are looking hard at how we want to be positioned in that space in terms of -- we have a great offering, we are looking hard how we want to be positioned as the category declines and we see pricing pressure there.", "Michael Farrell", "And the second one was with regard to DME customers and consolidation. And on that one, Saul, clearly we have -- 4000 to 6000 plus HMEs in the U.S. market. There are some changes as we talked about as we go through. I liked the analogy of the storm going through and it's led some order there. There is some cleanup there and there will be some consolidation and we have seen, and some of that has been public of some of these companies selling their assets from company A to company B. And the fundamental is that the patients are there, the volume is there and it will increase over the coming years. And so to what extent there is consolidation, we can't precisely tell but we are working with those who won bids within the competitive bidding environment and those who are bidding on the future. And as we look around the HME landscape, there are definitely signs of an HME that is planning for future growth. If an HME is investing in EasyCare Online, is driving usually to drive patient engagement and get patients adherent to care. And if an HME is using our electronic data in the change and programs to say, use our billing systems, such as say Brightree, where you can do a one stop shop and click to purchase ResMed products. Then they are thinking about efficiency, they are thinking about scale, they are thinking about cost and they are thinking about the long-term. And they are the type of HMEs that we are spending a lot of time working with to say what's an appropriate price premium for our products and what value will it drive for you in the market over the next 6, 12, 24 months. And we are working through all that. So we are very confident that we are working with those who are investing in the long term for this industry and those who are preparing for the long-term growth that we see of patients coming through the channel. Both in sleep and in home care, respiratory care and as longer-term, as we are already doing in Europe and Japan, in the cardiorespiratory space.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from Ben Haynor of Feltl and Company.", "Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company", "Just had a bit of a mechanics question on product introductions. When you introduce, say a new mask, do you typically see larger stocking orders to the DMEs and HMEs when the product is first introduced than you might see in subsequent quarters? Or is the reorder rate often enough where that doesn't factor in?", "Michael Farrell", "Yes, Ben, it's more often than not it's an S curve that goes up over time. There is not usually large lump at the start, it's more around spending time with the physicians, spending time with the providers, and spending time working with the channel to help get them familiar with the benefits of a new mask. For instance the AirFit P10, being 50% quieter and 50% lighter, you have to sit down there with the doctor and explain and show the benefits for it. And I think there is some early clinical data and a white paper showing, a patient gets 40 minutes more of sleep from that product, for instance. So you then need to talk to the physician and get them onboard with that. You have to talk to the provider to make sure it's on their schedule and negotiate pricing and so on. So it you like, it's an S curve with a bit of lag at the start, but then acceleration from there rather than the other way around.", "Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company", "Okay, great. So with a product like the AirFit P10, we should expect to see that go up the S-curve as time goes on?", "Michael Farrell", "Correct.", "Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company", "Okay. Great, well, congrats on that product. It seems like it is blowing the doors off.", "Operator", "And we are now at the 1 hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks.", "Michael Farrell", "Well, thank you. And as always, I would like to say thanks to all of you on this conference call for your interest and support of ResMed. Most importantly, I would like to thank the global ResMed team for our focus on improving the lives of patients, one breath at a time. We are about 7.5 million patients improved over the last 12 months. I couldn\u2019t thank you enough. Thanks a lot. Bye bye.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

(NYSE:RMD) F3Q2014 Results Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2014  4:30 PM ET", "Executives", "Mick Farrell - Chief Executive Officer", "Brett Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Jim Hollingshead - President, Americas", "Robert Douglas - President and COO", "Analysts", "David Stanton - CLSA", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America", "Bruce Du - CBA", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs", "Steve Wheen - JPMorgan", "Andrew Hanover - BMO Capital Markets", "Operator", "Welcome to the Q3 2014 ResMed, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. Thank you all for joining us today.", "Before we begin, ResMed has asked me to remind you that during this call ResMed may make forward-looking statements, such as projections of future revenue or earnings, new product development, or new markets for the company\u2019s products. Risks and uncertainties exist that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements.", "Additional information about factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is included in ResMed\u2019s SEC filings, which are available on the company\u2019s website. Please limit your questions to two at any one time. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue.", "Speaking on the call today are Mick Farrell, CEO; and Brett Sandercock, CFO. There are also other members of the management team present that will be available to answer questions.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mick Farrell. Mick, please go ahead.", "Mick Farrell", "Great. Thanks, John, and thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I\u2019ll review the highlights of our fiscal Q3 and then I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett to go through the quarter in more detail.", "So, first, the financial summary. Global revenue in the third quarter of fiscal \u201814 grew 4% year-on-year to $398 million. That is up 3% on a constant currency basis. America\u2019s revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis at $216 million. Europe, Asia and rest of world headline revenue increased 8% for the quarter to $182 million, which is 6% growth in constant currency terms.", "Net income for the quarter increased 6% to $90 million. GAAP EPS increased by 9% to $0.63 per share for the quarter, while hybrid earnings per share which excludes the amortization of intangibles was $0.64 per share. This bottom line result demonstrates strong global operating performance from our global team.", "Now, let me review the operating results in a little more detail. We look at our sales performance in the Americas in the context of year-on-year, as well as sequential quarterly results.", "Last year in Q3 of fiscal \u201813, we grew Americas revenue by 13%. Given this tough comparable and challenging market conditions in the U.S., keeping our topline flat on a year-over-year basis was a good result. Also, I\u2019d like to note that we grew the Americas revenue sequentially by 5% or around $9 million from Q2 to Q3.", "By category, in the Americas, revenue from masks grew by 2%. Flow generators declined by 2% year-over-year. We were up against very tough prior comparisons in the flow generator category, which grew at 21% during Q3 of last fiscal year. It\u2019s important to note that both of these categories on a sequential basis were an uptick from Q2 to Q3.", "U.S. market dynamics began to improve in Q3, although the environment is still evolving. New patient growth while still subdued is continuing and importantly, resupply to the installed base of patients is also growing.", "We continue to promote resupply and a nationwide research study we commissioned recently confirmed that resupply programs work. They provide better care for the patient and better results for the homecare provider and better outcomes for the payer. Our customers are also beginning to see stability in their businesses.", "As they adjust to the U.S. reimbursement changes from competitive bidding that went into effect in July last year for Medicaid patients in CB2. Many customers are growing back to -- getting back to growing patient volumes. These leading indicators tell us that the U.S. market is starting to stabilize.", "In January, just 90 days ago, in our Q2 call, we said that, we were going to adjust our pricing in response to competitive activity, particularly in the U.S. market and that played out during the quarter. We regained share during the quarter, although pricing adjustments were an offset to those volume gains, resulting in a flat quarter in revenue terms for the Americas.", "The U.S. market remains a highly competitive dynamic and going forward, we are going to make sure we are appropriately positioned for revenue growth as the competitive environment develops.", "We\u2019ll continue to use our innovation and our value propositions across the categories, including products, services and solutions to shape the variables that drive product preference and purchasing decisions.", "Our sales results for combined Europe and Asia-Pac and rest of world were led by constant currency growth in the mask category of 14%. The flow generator category across Europe, Asia-Pac and rest of world was 2%.", "We see upside for growth in this flow generator category going forward, with the launch of our respiratory care platform in these regions. And I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes.", "Europe delivered another quarter of very solid revenue growth in Q3 as it did in Q2. Our wholesale businesses did particularly well in major markets France, Germany and the U.K., as well as across our European dealer network, which includes the emerging Eastern European acquisitions that we talked about last quarter Poland and the Czech Republic.", "Our teams in Europe are well-positioned for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We remained on track with our previously announced product introduction plans. We launched the AirFit P10 as promised during the last quarter and that product is selling very well in the U.S. It is just launching as we speak into Europe and Asia-Pacific.", "During our last conference call, we promised to deliver two additional new masks to the market this fiscal year. We delivered on that promise this week, with the launch of two more AirFit branded mask offerings.", "The first, the AirFit F10, where F stands for full-face is the lightest full-face mask on the market. The AirFit N10, where N stands for nasal mask, is a new patient-preferred nasal mask that is highly unobtrusive and allows patients to have clear line of sight.", "These products deliver what patients want most, a light, comfortable, unobtrusive mask that is easy to use. Our pre-launch testing demonstrated that patients prefer these new mask offerings to those currently on the market and we expect physicians and providers will like them too. We\u2019re launching both of these new masks during Q1 -- during Q4 in the U.S. and most other geographies and we will continue the launch throughout Q1 in fiscal \u201815.", "In the flow generator category, we\u2019re delivering on our commitment as we said and are moving forward to full commercial launch for our new respiratory care platform, the Astral.", "The Astral is a new life support ventilation system that has competitive advantages in size and weight and it\u2019s being very well received by patients and providers during the controlled product launch that we\u2019ve been conducting in Europe during Q3.", "This product solution will enrich life for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD and neuromuscular disease. We are now ready to move to full commercial launch this quarter in most of our European and Asia-Pacific markets.", "We already have a strong homecare ventilation presence in these regions with a channel that\u2019s ready to go and the Astral will complement our existing respiratory care product offerings. We are in process for FDA clearance. Our 510(k) is submitted in the U.S. and we hope to launch in the U.S. later this calendar year.", "The hard work of our research and development teams is bearing fruit this quarter, with the multiple product launches across the globe running on schedule. And the strength of our design capability was recently validated when both the Astral and the AirFit P10 were awarded Red Dot Design awards.", "This is a global prestigious international product design competition, in fact, the largest design competition in the world and these two awards join our award from a few years ago. I think it was 2010 when we received the Red Dot for the S9 platform.", "Our clinical research continues to demonstrate the wide-ranging impact of sleep-disordered breathing on a variety of chronic conditions. I want to highlight three recent publications in this space before we go to Brett and then Q&A.", "First, on the clinical development front, there have been several recent studies suggesting intriguing links between sleep-disordered breathing and cancer. A pair of studies from 2012 and 2013 suggested an association between sleep apnea and increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality.", "Here in 2014 already, just earlier this month, Dr. Sina Gharib and his colleagues published a study in sleep, concluding that effective therapy of OSA with CPAP is associated with alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression.", "They suggested potential novel mechanisms linking OSA with cancer-related pathways. It\u2019s too early to understand the workings of the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and cancer malignancy or the interactions of CPAP therapy with cancer progression definitively. However, these early investigations confirm the systemic impact of sleep-disordered breathing and the potential benefits offered by our therapies to patients in this category.", "Second, in a more commercially-oriented study, Dr. Julian Guest and his colleagues are publishing a study in May and it\u2019s already online in the journal Diabetes Care. They are reporting on a resident-sponsored U.K. based study on a cost and outcomes data over a five-year period, treating patients with type 2 diabetes and concomitant obstructive sleep apnea.", "This study concluded that initiating treatment with CPAP in OSA patients with type 2 diabetes leads to significantly lower blood pressure and better control over the diabetes and it affords a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. So it improved outcomes and at better costs.", "Third and on the healthcare informatics front, the upcoming American Thoracic Society or ATS 2014 meeting, which will be here in San Diego next month, will feature a presentation demonstrating that our U-Sleep automated adherence and compliance program achieved positive patient outcomes with significant reductions in labor.", "The abstract of this presentation is already available online on the ATS website, so it\u2019s in the public domain and it shows that in a randomized trial, with one group receiving standard care, another group receiving standard care plus help with our adherence system called U-Sleep.", "The U-Sleep cohort achieved 83% adherence, whereas the standard care group achieved 73% adherence. The U-Sleep system also produced a 59% reduction in labor, that\u2019s 5-9, 59% reduction in labor for those improved outcomes.", "This is a validated example of the solutions we bring to our customers to promote not only superior patient outcomes, but also improved customer efficiency and thinking about both the healthcare clinical outcomes and the healthcare economics of the channel.", "So, finally in conclusion, we remain focused on the long run. Our markets remain under-penetrated and our patient solutions provide symptomatic relief for those on therapy, while slowing the progression of important chronic diseases, while additionally saving money for the entire healthcare system. We have the right solutions. We have the right people. We have the right approach to succeed. We\u2019re confident that we will continue to do so.", "So, now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett. Brett, over to you.", "Brett Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $397.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 3%. Income from operations for the quarter was $104.7 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter and net income for the quarter was $90 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter.", "Gross margin for the March quarter was 63.3%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to Q3 FY13. On a year-on-year basis, our gross margin benefited from manufacturing improvements, favorable product mix and favorable currency movements, partially offset by ASP declines.", "Looking forward, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates. Additionally, we continue to execute on initiatives targeting at improving our global manufacturing supply chain and logistics cost structures.", "SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115.1 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 7%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.9% compared to the year ago figure of 28.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 29% for fiscal year 2014.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $29.5 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, in constant currency terms R&D expenses increased by 7%. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4%, compared to the year ago figure of 8.1%.", "Looking forward, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2014. This reflects an ongoing commitment to investing in a diverse product pipeline.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.5 million for the quarter, while stock based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.2 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.3% compared to the prior year quarter effective tax rate of 21.4%. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 will be in the vicinity of 21%.", "Turning now to revenue in more detail. Overall sales in the Americas were $216.1 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $181.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. In the Americas, flow generator sales were $93.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, while masks and other sales were $122.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $118.8 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 2%.", "Masks and other sales were $62.9 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1% while masks and other increased by 6%. Cash flow from operations was $101.1 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $17.8 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.2 million. Our share buyback continues to play a major role in our capital management program.", "During the quarter, we repurchased 1.64 million shares for consideration of $72.5 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 19.1 million shares remaining under our authorized buyback program. In addition to the share buyback, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with our previously advised dividend policy.", "Our balance sheet remains strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $543 million, while at March 31, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.7 billion.", "I\u2019ll now hand the call back to the operator for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "David Stanton - CLSA", "Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. I wonder if -- I\u2019ve got two questions, please. Firstly on bundling, we\u2019ve been hearing stories about the fact that there perhaps might be bundling from competitive bidding coming. I\u2019d like some color on that. And then just one for Brett on gross margin going forward, you\u2019ve guided to 61% to 63%. I presume that\u2019s for FY \u201814. Can you give us some color about why the guidance is down for gross margin? Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "David, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll take the first part. I\u2019ll hand the second to Brett. Bundling at CMS, yes, we don\u2019t know where CMS is going with this. They have introduced a discussion item and asking for providers and other physicians in the industry to give feedback.", "There are two ways to look at this. If CMS does decide to implement bundling, ResMed is not only ready, willing, but also able, to respond to a market like that because we already are in one.", "In France, we have a bundling model where providers are paid a fixed amount per member, per month to look after patients on sleep apnea therapy. And we work with them. There are certain minima in terms of the number of masks that they have to provide the number of visits, they have to provide the number of tubing, accessories and filters and interaction with the patients. So our assumption is that CMS, if they did go forward, the bundling approach would have such minima in their programs.", "Looking at it from another angle. There was a recent OIG report that looked at the replenishment rates that are currently there for CMS patients in the U.S. And what it found was for the vast majority of patients they are well under half the maxima requirements by the different category units for existing competitive bidding programs.", "So we don\u2019t think its way up on the radar. And in response to that OIG report, CMS decided to stay with the current system. So from our perspective, we\u2019d be ready to go with either a bundled model or a not-bundled model. It will be interesting to see where providers land on this but I think that no matter where the market goes, we\u2019ll be prepared to move with it on that front.", "Brett, do you want to take the second part of the question regarding gross margin?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Thanks, Mick. On the gross margin front, we sort of ticked down a little bit. And look, it really is a reflection of some of the ASP declines that we\u2019ve seen recently. And I think that had some impact on our margin in Q3. And we just down-ticked a little bit in terms of margin guidance to account for that.", "And the other factor, I suppose, that\u2019s been helping us out over the last little while has been some FX benefit, particularly with the depreciation in the Aussie dollar. That\u2019s flattened out somewhat now. So those FX benefits, I think, were certainly far less than what we\u2019ve experienced in the past, particularly if you look at it on a sequential basis. So they are kind of those two are the underlying drivers of the slight decline expected in the margin.", "David Stanton - CLSA", "So -- and just to confirm that\u2019s an overall -- that 61% to 63%, that\u2019s an overall number for the rest of FY \u201814 or \u201814, sorry?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. This is -- as you know, Dave, a lot of moving parts on the margin. So it gets more difficult to predict, but that is, yeah, that is more a Q4 short-term prediction on the margin.", "David Stanton - CLSA", "", "Okay. So that\u2019s Q4. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Clair from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one is just on pricing. You mentioned in the commentary that you have done some pricing adjustments. Are these largely done at this point?", "Mick Farrell", "Sure, David. Well, pricing is an interaction between us and our customers on a day-to-day basis. It\u2019s a supply-and-demand interaction that goes on. If you are asking specifically whether the effect of CB2, particularly on our U.S. market, is playing out, then I think the answer is yes. We\u2019re nine months into the play-out of CB2 within the U.S. market and we\u2019re 12 months into when the prices were announced for CB2 in the U.S. market.", "So clearly, our customers have known about this for 12 months in terms of the new pricing. We\u2019ve been working for them over the last nine months. And I think, clearly, in the last quarter, we sent a strong signal to our customers that we\u2019re here to work with you. But I\u2019d like to make the point that we\u2019re here to work with them on two fronts. We\u2019re here to work with them on pricing and terms, but we\u2019re also here to work with them on business efficiency.", "So we have the ResMed online store which provides HME partners with an automatic access to order 24/7, 365 from ResMed. We have electronic data interchange, which not only large nationals, but now a number of the regionals are getting involved with.", "We have EasyCare Online, which is an informatics platform available to all our customers. And many, many more patients every day get connected with EasyCare Online. And our providers find it\u2019s a great way to track adherence, drive adherence and measure outcomes.", "And finally U-Sleep. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you\u2019ve got a trend 10% increase in adherence and you\u2019ve got the opportunity to lower labor costs by 59% by partnering with ResMed then is it all about $1 on the upfront price or is it about $5 saving in the net present value, over a 12, 24 month time period with the patient? So we\u2019re looking at pricing in multiple variants. David, what was your second question?", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "My second question is just -- you described -- it sounds like the U.S. environment is stable to improving. Do you have any metrics you can provide on patient volumes or I guess any color you could provide would be great?", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, I\u2019ll ask Jim Hollingshead, our President of the Americas, to address the U.S. market.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yeah. I think stable to improving is probably the right way to describe it, David. We don\u2019t have -- as you guys know, on these calls, we don\u2019t have perfect data on underlying market demand. We piece it together, just like you guys did too.", "What we\u2019re seeing is really decent patient volume growth. Our general sense is that, as CB2 has stabilized and the Medicare contracts have shifted, a number of the accounts that won Medicare -- a number of our customers that won Medicare contracts are actually seeing growth in volume. The customers who lost Medicare contracts have in many cases, gone out and worked on referrals that would allow them to capture commercial pay patients.", "And so you\u2019re seeing some movement in both directions on that front. We think patient growth remains pretty good, both for new patients and also for resupply. So, overall, that trend is, I think, fairly solid in the U.S. market.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "And then just one last one, if I can sneak it in here. In terms of the AirFit mask launches that are going on right now, do you expect these to carry a price premium to the older masks?", "Mick Farrell", "Well, traditionally, David, we\u2019ve priced our new masks in line with the products that are currently in market. I mean clearly, we all know that reimbursements generally are moving in a downward trajectory. And so we need to be able to take cost out of the system by business efficiency, but then be able to ensure pricing is relatively stable. So in general, we\u2019ve kept pricing in parity with our new masks with those in the market, or very close to.", "And that\u2019s the plan not only for the P10 as you mentioned, the pillows mask, but also for the AirFit N10, the nasal mask and the AirFit F10. The full trilogy now of AirFit masks are in the market and we\u2019re really excited about their potential. But pricing is going to be pretty much on par.", "David Clair - Piper Jaffray", "", "Great. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Prior from Bank of America. Please go ahead", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America", "Yeah good morning guys. Just two questions, both in relation to rest of world flow gen, if I can. Mick, just in terms of the strong comments you made in regards to Europe, if I can just ask any color around France in particular, given that change to informatics regulations as of October. What you\u2019ve seen there; whether that\u2019s helped you in terms of patient compliance or the business model?", "And then secondly, just given the 4% growth number out of rest of world flow gen, that still remains somewhat depressed versus prior year. Can you give us some sense as to whether Japan is still dragging there or ex-Europe, what\u2019s going on in terms of rest of world flow gen? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "So, I\u2019ll have a go at the France side. And then I\u2019ll ask Rob Douglas, our President and COO, to talk about Japan. I mean the short answer on France is we don\u2019t break out rest of world, as you know, Matt, into detail. And certainly, we don\u2019t break out Europe and then we don\u2019t break out France on the flow gen front.", "But I can talk to you qualitatively about what\u2019s happening in France, which is a very important market for us. The head of the group that looks at regulatory approval and pricing for this market for us in France established a differential reimbursement model for devices that have wireless capability and devices that don\u2019t have wireless capability. And it was a planned, sequential, phased differential between the two different types of product categories.", "That was put into place in October last year and has been running for four months. There have been some court appeals by some patient groups and some folks who were involved in the industry that have slowed down the response on that. And that is still in the court for deciding what is the best approach.", "From the payer front and from the patient front, we think enabling and liberating the data from the bedside table for the payer, for the patient and for the provider is the best thing. And we think that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to land. Having said that, while this has been in play, we have certainly been able to not only sell our device systems but also our EasyCare Online system, which was ready to go October 1, 2013, when that was put in play.", "So we are prepared. We\u2019re already working with our home care providers in France to make that work. And we see good signals ahead as that plays out in France. But I want to say that that play is well beyond just the country of France. We think that will apply not only in France and Germany and the U.K., but also across all of Western Europe and has high potential in that space.", "Rob, do you want to address the Japan question?", "Rob Douglas", "Sure, Matt. Japan remains a lumpy market for us. It\u2019s basically a good market with good reimbursement and really good focus on patient care. But how the -- in terms of specific ordering patterns of our customers and the way their managing their fleet, that type of thing it remains a lumpy market. It hasn\u2019t been a strong quarter for us in Japan.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America", "Great. Thanks, guys. And if I can just have one more in terms of the U.S., in particular, on CPAP, Mick, you mentioned last quarter that the price competition was particularly focused in the CPAP category. Have you seen that bleed into APAP at all, in terms of discounting pressure?", "Mick Farrell", "Matt, we don\u2019t -- as we said on the last call, we don\u2019t go into details on pricing across the whole category of flow gens and certainly won\u2019t go into details on individual categories. But as a summary statement, pricing impacts have been across the board on categories.", "And what we\u2019re doing is appropriately pricing across SKUs but across customers, across segments, across geographies for appropriate pricing, to ensure solid volume gain and long-term good revenue growth. And to signal to our customers that we\u2019re therefore doing CB2, but also that we are there for you to drive business efficiency, as well as looking at the upfront pricing.", "Matthew Prior - Bank of America", "Great, understood. Thanks, guys.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA. Please go ahead.", "Bruce Du - CBA", "Yes, can you hear me?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. You must have been on mute.", "Bruce Du - CBA", "Yes. Okay. Great. I just had a question in relation to the masks. And specifically around your experience in terms of the AirFit P10, whether you are predominantly seeing that growth in new patients, or you are seeing actual conversions from existing patients. Given my understanding, obviously, is that historically patients have been quite sticky on masks and you guys obviously would have a benefit if you can convert those patients given the fewer parts in a lot of masks and whatnot. But just could you talk to your experience, in terms of converting the North American patients or whether or not the growth dynamic there is mainly existing versus new patients?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Bruce. Well, you\u2019re right in that. It is quite sticky. Like a great pair of jeans or a pair shoes that you love, patients tend to stick to the existing product, even when they go for the new purchase and that trend has remained. The AirFit P10, which we launched in January, is now in day 90 in the U.S. market. And as we said earlier, is just launching into Europe and Asia-Pacific, as we speak here in Q4.", "So talking about the U.S. these last 90 days, we\u2019re sort of starting that S-curve of penetration of a fantastic new product. I actually personally use the AirFit P10 every night. I wore it last night. And it is an unobtrusive, light and very comfortable mask. And it\u2019s particularly -- its diffusion of the air is so comfortable for the bed partner, that we do expect great success from it. But we expect that success primarily with the new patients.", "Bruce Du - CBA", "Okay. Great. And just I guess, you referenced before the GAO report, just wondering, obviously one of the things that data point showed was quite a significant consolidation in terms of the market share of the four largest distributors. Is that pretty consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in the Round 2 regions thus far as well?", "Mick Farrell", "Bruce, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get the gist of your question. Can you ask it one more time and then Jim and I will have a go at getting to it?", "Bruce Du - CBA", "It was just in relation to I guess the Round 1, the GAO report recently released showed the concentration of market share in the Round I areas of the four largest DMEs in the U.S. had increased quite considerably over the first 12 months of Round I. I was just wondering whether or not you had seen, I guess a similar pattern evolving the Round 2 regions thus far?", "Mick Farrell", "Dave, why don\u2019t you -- David Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and Global General Counsel.", "David Pendarvis", "Sure. So, Bruce, I\u2019m pretty familiar with that report. And obviously, it was based on some early data, Round 2 of competitive bidding, a much bigger chunk of the overall U.S. market. And as Jim was saying earlier, while we\u2019re seeing things play out in terms of market share shifts in the winners for Medicare patients and also in terms of the commercial patients shifting, it\u2019s probably too early to say whether there\u2019s any significant consolidation along the lines that that report found in Medicare, so just early days. You could posit that it would be the case, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet.", "Bruce Du - CBA", "Okay. Thank you.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks Bruce.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I was just curious about -- with your pricing adjustments, the timing of that. I know you discussed it on your last conference call. But that was already a few months into the March quarter. So is that something that started kind of at the very beginning of the calendar year?", "Or was it something that was kind of done mid-quarter? Because I guess your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter kind of -- fiscal fourth quarter, kind of implies that there\u2019s some additional declines coming in gross margin. So, maybe you could just clarify that for me?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. So, Mike, the call that we did was actually in January, so we were in month one of Q3 when we made the call. And we said, we were going to appropriately price to ensure volume gains and revenue gains. And also, as I\u2019ve been focusing on this call, about the efficiency gains that we can provide, the solutions we can give to our HME providers.", "I would say, those discussions happened throughout the quarter. With well north of 4,000 customers in the U.S. and you think, globally, you are in the tens of thousands of customers this is something that happens throughout a daily basis, a weekly basis, as we interact with our customers. So, clearly, the spread is throughout the quarter.", "Brett\u2019s guidance of $0.61 to $0.63 I think is solid. It takes into account what we have done and have seen and what we expect to see here in Q4. So it all makes sense. And it all makes sense for ensuring we\u2019re appropriately priced, we have got the appropriate terms and we focus on the efficiencies we can provide by talking to customers and providing that value to them.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company", "And just so that I get it clearly here, the bulk of these adjustments are -- have already taken place, as of the end of the March quarter? Is that a fair statement? I know you are always having these discussions, but I guess this was kind of a bigger than normal type of cycle that you went through here so?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, look, clearly, Mike, there are many factors involved in the supply-demand, our activity, competitive activity, changes in the market. But yeah, as I said earlier, given that we\u2019re 12 months into the pricing of CB2 within the U.S., nine months into the play-out of how it hits the P&L for our U.S. based customers, that being the largest impact change that\u2019s happened on the reimbursement front, I think your assumption is right. The bulk of the impact is there and our guidance going forward is that we\u2019re going to work with our customers to make sure it happens. And we\u2019ll be flexible, based on the needs of the market.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company", "Okay. Thanks. And then just one question on the Astral family of products. Is that a completely new product category that you\u2019re entering? Or is that sort of a redesign of an existing product line that you already had?", "Mick Farrell", "So, I will hand over to Geoff Neilson, our President of the Respiratory Care business.", "Geoff Neilson", "So that\u2019s a completely new life support product platform. And we do have life-support products through our Elisee and VS lines available in rest of world, but we haven\u2019t brought these products to the U.S. market. So this will be a new product line in the U.S. market. We estimate the global market for that product -- the available market for that product to be around $200 million something and evenly split between the U.S. and Europe. So we\u2019ve got that upside for bringing that product to U.S.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company", "Okay. Thanks. And then just one final question on the flow generator business. I know in the past few years you had been seeing a really nice mix shift towards some of the auto setting and bi-levels. And some of that, I guess, was being driven by the move toward home testing. So, are you still seeing that mix shift happening in that part of your business?", "Mick Farrell", "Mike, we are. Home sleep testing, we are tracking very closely. And on a trailing 12-month basis, between 35% and 40% of U.S. diagnosis and these last 12 months were through home sleep testing. With the prior authorization and the focus of insurance companies on this space, the needle continues to tick up on that. And as you look forward the next 6, 12 months, we\u2019ll be looking at 40% to 45%, approaching 50%, of diagnosis in the home sleep testing front in that timeframe.", "So we think we know that that will start to move up and we know that that will drive a mix shift from CPAP to APAP on a continuing basis. We also think the introduction of products like the Astral with its large $200 million addressable market, globally and then you add all the other respiratory care ventilators that we have in our pipeline and will continue to introduce. There\u2019s a lot of upside on the flow generator front in terms of positive mix shift for us.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you and good morning. Just a couple of quick ones for me, perhaps for Brett; relates to FX. Just if you could give us, Brett, a bit of a guide on the benefits seen in COGS from movements in FX. And secondly, what hedge gains were there, or might there have been in the other income line?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. Sure, Sean. I\u2019ll do it a few different ways. If you just looked at it sequentially Q2 to Q3, we didn\u2019t see any FX benefit at all come through. It was pretty neutral. We\u2019re still getting some of the benefits coming through if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, so that was in the order of 100 basis points year-on-year was benefiting us, but neutral on a sequential basis. So that was the impact there. And then the other part of that question, Sean?", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley", "The hedge gains in the other income line?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, that was in the other income. It was in the order of a few million dollars.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley", "", "Perfect. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks, Brett.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Good afternoon, guys. So, I guess a couple questions for us. Can you give us maybe some other examples of things that suggest to you that the market is stabilizing? Are you seeing promotions decline? Are you seeing kind of quarter-on-quarter pricing changes normalize? Maybe just talk a little bit more about those specific examples in the marketplace.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Ben. I\u2019ll address some and hand to Jim for some other early indicators here. We talked about this at J.P. Morgan and we\u2019ve talked about it since, but we\u2019re seeing primary care physician\u2019s visits start to pick up. We\u2019re seeing referrals from those primary care physicians related to sleep specifically, whether they are referrals to a sleep lab for a PSG, or to home sleep testing, IDTF type models increase.", "So the needles on both of those are moving up. There\u2019s publicly available data from the payers and there\u2019s some from CMS. And there is some private data that we were able to access from talking to some of the private payers. All of those show the needles are ticking up in terms of patient volumes. So the leading indicators on referrals and on the reimbursement are starting to tick up. And those indicate for us, that the stability in the U.S. market is starting to come back and volume growth is picking up.", "We also saw volume growth for ourselves during the quarter. We\u2019re not going to go specifically into that because we\u2019re not releasing our ASPs. And so if we give you the volume gains, you\u2019ll be able to reverse calculate that. And we don\u2019t want to do that for competitive reasons. But we know the volumes are starting to stabilize and starting to pick up, not just through the early indicators, but through many interactions we have with our customers. Jim, any more color to add there?", "Jim Hollingshead", "I think it\u2019s a great question, Ben and it\u2019s difficult to point to concrete thing. But I guess I would point to two or three things. The first one is just to reiterate what Mick just said. Volume growth is strong and volume growth was stronger in Q3 than it had been over the previous couple of quarters, I would say. So that\u2019s a good indication. The topic of conversation with our customers is shifting. Every customer is different and there\u2019s thousands of customers that are different size and different business mixes.", "But the conversations we are having now tend to be more about how do I stabilize my own product mix? How do I do X, Y and Z, to drive profitability? That\u2019s a really different topic of conversation than it was, say, right after rates went into effect. And so you can see our customers have worked through some of the chaos that they faced with reimbursement changes and are now stabilizing their own business models and they\u2019re asking different questions.", "And we tend to be working with them on things like business efficiency more than we were, say, two quarters ago. And then I\u2019d say, the kind of tone and tenor in the market, just the sort of qualitative feel in the market. This is a very qualitative thing, but I\u2019d say the vibe is a bit better. Nobody is happy about reimbursement rates. None of our customers are and we are not. That continues to be a tough pill to swallow. But the tone and tenor has improved in our conversations with customers and just generally on the market.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "", "Okay. And then I guess another question of the two, for me would be to Mick. And if you take the gross margin trends, where the currency is at, you\u2019ve given us pretty specific guidance relative to the fourth quarter, if you will of your fiscal year. If we flow that into \u201815, is that stable? Or is that going to take another step lower, because of the move of some currency as we roll that in?", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, Ben. As you know, there are multiple factors that go into gross margin from COGS reductions, mix shifts and exchanges between the euro and the U.S. dollar, the euro and the Aussie and the U.S. dollar and the Aussie. We\u2019ve been able to achieve some fantastic efficiencies through what we\u2019re doing in our Singapore plant and growing there.", "We\u2019re doing some great things on the S9 platform in some of the masks that have been out there for a while. But at the same time, we\u2019re introducing new products, which can have an impact on that. Our primary focus is on ensuring topline growth and making sure that goes through. In gross margin, as you saw in this quarter and our guidance for Q4, can be a tool to help us ensure that we continue to have good revenue growth.", "So, I know, Ben, you are sort of asking me to posit FY \u201815 GM. We don\u2019t do that. We put it out 90 days and we give that guidance of 61% to 63% that Brett just did, because that\u2019s the sort of time horizon that we think we can predict it on, in a useful manner. So, Q4, 61% to 63%. We\u2019re solid with that. And then in 90 days, we\u2019ll get in touch regarding Q1 for FY \u201815.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair", "Okay. And maybe just another way of looking at that, is the balance of interests here between volume growth ticking back up? Is your share beginning to tick back up, as you\u2019ve made these adjustments to price, or is share really kind of stabilizing? Even just qualitatively on masks and/or generators would be helpful? Thanks. ", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah. Look, I\u2019ll just talk to it generally. I would say our share not only is stabilized, but probably we took a little bit of share when you think about the global scale. And we think that\u2019s the right position for us to be as the market leader. Thanks, Ben.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies", "Hi. Thanks gentlemen. I guess, Mick, to just follow up on the market share comments that you just threw out there. I mean, was that specific -- it sounds like you\u2019ve put in a new pricing strategy here in the U.S. and then had sort an effect on market share shifts. So, specifically in the U.S., did those price changes result in a share gain, say, amongst your large DME customers, Lincare, Apria and Rotech, for instance, or did you see more share gains on smaller customers? Just trying to get a sense of how that played out in the quarter.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don\u2019t go into the detailed share across the categories, certainly not by individual customer type. But qualitatively and generally, looking at the U.S. market specifically, we think -- what we said 90 days ago is that we\u2019re going to appropriately price to ensure that ResMed remains the market leader and ensures providing business efficiency for our customers. We executed on that in the last 90 days and I do think we got some volume share gain.", "And clearly, there were some price concessions that were a part of that. But more importantly were the hooks we put into our customers for the long-term, which is we\u2019re working with you, we\u2019re partnering with you and we\u2019re going to help you lower your costs. So it\u2019s a high value for you, the patient and ultimately the payer, who will save as we keep these patients out of hospital and in the home. But, no, we won\u2019t go into further detail than that.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies", "Sure. No, fair enough. And maybe just with this new pricing strategy within the U.S. and it seems amongst the competitors, I mean, is there a way where to sort of look out and sort of judge timing-wise, where -- not necessarily it\u2019s a floor, but it goes back to where the normal was, which I think, if we go back a couple of years ago, it was normal to see 4% to 5% price declines in the industry. It seems like it\u2019s more than that now, certainly in the U.S. But is there a time where it gets back to normalization? And then just one quick follow-up on CMS audits. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah. Anthony, so if you look back at the last five, even 10 years, there are step changes and then there are settling, slow gradient changes that have happened in our industry. Clearly, we have had a step change. I\u2019m not going to go into specifics of percentages and year-on-year, as we talked about 90 days ago. That doesn\u2019t make sense for competitive reasons. But qualitatively thinking about it, there are step changes that happened and that has happened.", "Do we expect that stability after a step change? Yes. Are we working towards that? Yes. Would our customers like it? I actually think yes, because stability in this market, now that CB2 has been digested and planning forward now, which is for how do we get to the $40 million to $60 million Americans, right? We\u2019re talking about the U.S. market, $40 million to $60 million Americans that have sleep disordered breathing. Remember we\u2019ve only got $6 million of them diagnosed and treated. It\u2019s going to happen through stability in the investments in working with primary care physicians; working with patient awareness to drive the patients through to the channel. We\u2019re starting to see that stability, starting to see the needle pop up and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So your third, sneak question there, Anthony, was regard to?", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies", "Yeah, I apologize. Just we attended Spring Medtrade and there was just this whole focus on CMS audits of DMEs. I\u2019m just wondering if you have an opinion on that and how that just sort of shaking out? Thanks again.", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah. Thanks, Anthony. I\u2019ll hand that to Jim.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yeah, we think that the audit rate and the procedure for audit is a huge burden on our customers. And we would prefer to see Medicare get their act together.", "Mick Farrell", "Fair enough. Thanks, Anthony.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Thanks very much guys actually, that was a question I had. That was the hot topic we found at Medtrade, as well. And I guess Jim answered that just in terms of the intensity there, I guess they would the intensity they -- I guess you would expect to grow. I guess what my question was, is anything that impacting sales? And is there anything you can do. I know you\u2019ve spoken to U-Sleep to help with DMEs through that audit process?", "Mick Farrell", "Actually, we\u2019ve seen some stability. Look, I\u2019m not as close to it as Jim, so I\u2019ll let him answer it in a second. From where I\u2019ve seen it and certainly as you look at American Association for Homecare and a lot of the providers now getting on Capitol Hill and working with CMS to understand how to solve this. They are certainly focusing on -- audits are important, because if there\u2019s fraud abuse, you need to catch it and move it out. But you can\u2019t have the one bad apple spoil the whole barrel.", "And clearly, that\u2019s the message from the providers. And clearly, nine, 12 months into these changes, I think even CMS and the auditors are starting to realize that changing the game and ensuring these patients stay out of hospital is the right thing for the U.S. healthcare system; and particularly, Medicare going through all the changes it\u2019s going through right now and all the patients coming in with the Affordable Care Act. So as we look towards it, we actually see some stability rather than growing of the audits, in terms of how they are looking at it. But, Jim, I don\u2019t know if you have any color there.", "Jim Hollingshead", "So what I would say is we have very little we can do about Medicare and how they\u2019re doing audits. So it\u2019s a burden on our customers because, as you guys know, there\u2019s a big backlog in audits and Medicare is not processing them, in many cases, in a timely fashion. And that hurts our customers\u2019 cash flow, because their payments get held up.", "And so, it is a hot topic. And it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s a hot topic. We don\u2019t see any measurable, direct impact on sales, because patients come in the door and they need to get set up and DMEs will set them up. But it\u2019s frustrating for us to watch what our customers have to go through in that regulatory environment that is actually not operating efficiently, right. So, I think it\u2019s a positive that there\u2019s a spotlight put on it. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s been raised and I think it has been raised also at the Congressional level. Now it\u2019s gotten some scrutiny and the OIG has looked at it and so on. So, hopefully, there will be a resolution.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to get more intense before it gets better. But, as I said, I think it would be better if Medicare could find a way to relieve that, especially the backlog. It\u2019s completely appropriate for Medicare to be policing what DMEs do, what -- in any space that they are reimbursing and making sure that there\u2019s no fraud and abuse and that patients are being treated appropriately. But to place an extra burden in terms of volume of audits and then not be able to process them within their own guidelines is arguably unfair and needs to be corrected.", "Mick Farrell", "I guess the follow-on there is just from a technology front; is there anything that you can bring to the table I guess going forward that might help them with the informatics and the documentation they need to provide here?", "Jim Hollingshead", "", "I think we\u2019re looking at a range of solutions that are business process automation solutions. Every flow point, every business flow point for our customers is an area under scrutiny. And with some areas in development, we\u2019re not going to talk about our product roadmap for competitive reasons.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Sure.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for your questions, Andrew.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS", "Perfect. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, just looking at the sequentially -- a question for Brett -- looking at the impact of FX on gross margin, heading into Q4. I know it\u2019s been quite volatile over the last few months. Can you perhaps give a bit of color as to what that impact will be?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. I think going into Q4 -- look, I\u2019d estimate we\u2019re at probably a slight positive for us, probably in the order of 30 basis points on a sequential basis. It will probably eat a little bit. The currency has been jumping around a lot likely; it\u2019s pretty volatile. So I think that you\u2019d probably see a small benefit in Q4. And then on a sequential basis, you kind of lose that, I think, going forward into Q1. But it\u2019s nothing like what we were getting over the 12 months year-on-year period. It is starting to certainly flatten out.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then my second question is on the accounts receivable. That seemed to go up quite significantly during that balanced state. Is there anything driving that? And would you think that would normalize going forward?", "Brett Sandercock", "Revenues are up sequentially and the receivables would be up. If I look at the days sales, that\u2019s pretty much in our -- how we look at it, pretty much in our historical range that we look at, Ian. So it might be an uptick in absolute terms, but I think when you look at DSOs, that it looks in the range.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steve Wheen - JPMorgan", "Yeah, good morning. And I just wanted to ask about the new product launches that you have. What sort of impact they -- you could expect to see on the gross margin, from perhaps efficiencies in manufacturing processes?", "Mick Farrell", "Well, so, we\u2019ve launched the AirFit P10, the AirFit N10, the AirFit F10, as well as the Astral, so it\u2019s quite a complex set of products to talk to. Rob, do you want to have a go? ", "Robert Douglas", "Yes. I mean, again, Steve, we don\u2019t break out all the details of this. But, generally, our policy with our R&D and our product teams is to continually improve products by making them simpler, less parts and better supplier relationships. Obviously, as you introduce new products, you then restart on an experience curve, which you then start putting on continuous improvements onto and that will ramp down.", "And then as we go up the learning curve, building initial launch volumes and all of that type of thing, it\u2019s quite a complex thing. So there\u2019s many factors at play here. And then net of it is -- the intent of our product program is to drive cost out of the products and keep trying to improve them and make them better in many parameters. And we expect to see that continuing.", "Steve Wheen - JPMorgan", "Okay. And just also in the gross margin, we\u2019ve been seeing that - this perhaps is a question for Brett that mix shift advantage from CPAP to APAP. Has that largely run out now, that we\u2019re -- I would say, probably to move into that sort of shift? And are we more, now, just particularly in this quarter, seeing mix shift advantages just because masks will be greater than flow generators?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, Steve. I think, look at over the last few years, you can probably -- that shift, or mix shift impact, has probably moderated overtime either time. I think it\u2019s still up and it\u2019s moderated to some extent. But I think some of the other new generation platforms such as Astral and so on -- as we get through that, as we get deeper into FY \u201815, I think some of those will be supportive of product mix and then supportive of gross margin as well. But it\u2019s really early -- as Rob said, it\u2019s really early days in the launch. We have three new mask products. We have the brand-new Astral platform. And we do certainly see, as we work through a lot of the margin expansion initiatives, that we can drive those costs, over the next 12 months as our experience increases on these new products and certainly think we can get some upside there, Whether that plays out in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, I think there areas there that are certainly providing potential for us in my view.", "Steve Wheen - JPMorgan", "And so I guess and more specifically to the quarter, was there quite an advantage, just given that very strong mask growth rate from a mix shift perspective?", "Brett Sandercock", "You know what? If I looked at it -- so if I look at it year-on-year, we still had a strong. If f you like, we still had product mix benefits flowing through and that was meaningful. If you look at it purely sequentially, it was more of much smaller -- it was a much smaller impact.", "Steve Wheen - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Hanover - BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I just wanted to ask a couple, or one, strategic question. And that is in relation to Japan and what will it take to get Japan on more steady footing?", "Mick Farrell", "Andrew, I will hand that question to Rob Douglas. ", "Robert Douglas", "So, on Japan, it\u2019s a long project for us. It\u2019s always been a lumpy market. And quite frankly, that\u2019s just the way structure -- the way that our customers are structured and the way they run their business. For us, it means it\u2019s a very efficient market. There\u2019s only a small number of customers. They are running these large businesses. It\u2019s good market for us, because we don\u2019t need a large team to service it, but we do have the downside of this lumpiness.", "So we don\u2019t see that type of structure changing at all. In a sense, some of that lumpiness will continue. Our view of the Japan market is that underlying it, it\u2019s actually still quite underpenetrated. And so our efforts are generally around either providing clinical evidence of the benefit of our products in Japan, or driving demand and patient awareness in the medical system there to drive patients in. That\u2019s got to be offset by relationships with the reimbursement authorities in Japan, so that -- or the funding can all add up to that, as well, But that\u2019s been an ongoing project and we\u2019ll keep on with that strategy.", "Andrew Hanover - BMO Capital Markets", "Great. And actually one more question and it\u2019s in relation to diagnostic testing. Back in October, you said that approximately 35% of diagnostic tests were being performed home -- via home sleep testing. And it was supposed get to 40% to 45% in the U.S. over the next 12 months. Just wanted to get a perspective or an update on that. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah. So, Andrew, I just said a little earlier in the Q&A that we\u2019re a little north of that 35% from October. We\u2019re now looking at 35% to 40%, so the needle is still moving up. It\u2019s not moving up as fast as it was, but it\u2019s moving up in that sort of 5% increments over those two quarters.", "As we look forward towards October, at the end of this year, we still think it will be at that 40% to 45% area. And even by the end of the calendar year, that 45% might tick-up a little and start to approach 50%. But it\u2019s payer-by-payer; it\u2019s group-by-group. And it has really been driven by the payer authorities working with their sleep physicians and the home sleep testing as well as the sleep labs, to ensure that patients can get through on therapy.", "Moving to a scaled one, allowing the mix shift from CPAP to APAP, we see that trend continuing to play out. Jim, do you want to provide some more color? ", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yeah, I\u2019d just add a couple of interesting tidbits on that. The first one is that our data show that, right now, roughly 60% of sleep labs are doing home sleep testing. And that\u2019s pretty dramatic movement over the last several months. Many sleep labs were trying to avoid doing home sleep testing, but now roughly 60% are engaged in home sleep testing. And the other thing that\u2019s quite interesting in our dataset with sleep labs -- sleep labs that do actively engage with home sleep testing actually end up doing more overall volume, including in-lab overnight volume. And so both of those things suggest that home sleep testing adoption will continue to move forward. Now that sleep labs are realizing that it\u2019s in their interest to do it as well.", "Operator", "We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell for his final remarks. ", "Mick Farrell", "Great. Thanks, John. As always, I\u2019d like to thank all of you on this conference call for your interest and your support of ResMed. Most importantly, I\u2019d like to thank the global ResMed team, providing solutions in over 100 countries, for your focus on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Thank you very much. See you in 90 days.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Larissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations at ResMed. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed's live earnings webcast. Joining me on the call today is Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com. We have also posted an updated investor deck, which may be found on the Events and Presentation section of the company's Investor Relations website.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could also cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to everyone who is joining us today as we provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2014 results. I'll review the market dynamics, provide an update on product launches and review progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Brett, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.", "To briefly review the highlights, Q4 revenue was flat on a year-on-year basis and declined 1% excluding currency impacts. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 3% for the quarter to $0.64. Non-GAAP EPS, excluding amortization of intangibles, was $0.66.", "Our revenue was lower than anticipated during Q4, primarily due to headwinds in our U.S. sales. This was offset by very strong growth in Europe, particularly, as well as in Asia.", "Before I discuss our Americas results in more detail, I'd like to emphasize that we believe that our performance in the U.S. will improve over the coming fiscal year, and there are 3 reasons for this.", "One, the U.S. market structure is stabilizing as we anniversary the second round of competitive bidding with patient referral volume starting to grow. Two, the pricing adjustments that we put in place during Q3 will begin and continue to wash through the comparisons. And three, the change in buying behavior that we saw from some U.S. customers in Q4 to move away from end-of-quarter bulk deals to a more consistent ordering pattern should continue.", "This latter point is good for us in the medium to long term as it steadies the supply chain for our customers, our suppliers and for our global operations team. However, it clearly had a negative short-term impact that we saw in Q4 in the U.S. numbers.", "In terms of the factors that we control, our ResMed team will continue to execute on our strategy of launching new products, services and solutions that provide exceptional value for our customers. I remain confident in the more than 4,000-strong ResMed team, our global growth and our ability to execute to our long-term strategy.", "Okay. Let me drill down into our U.S. sales in 2 categories: first, our flow generator category; and second, our masks and accessories category. We have seen continued stabilization in the underlying market trends with patient referrals and growth in volumes and referrals to diagnostic channels in our flow generator category. However, flow generator and the accompanying mask revenues softened at the end of Q4.", "There were 2 key reasons for this: one, the change in buying behavior that we noted previously in some large U.S. customers; and two, industry rumors circulated during the quarter regarding a predicted launch of a new ResMed sleep flow generator on July 1. There was actually a particular date that was part of the rumor.", "Since we are past that date, it was clearly a false rumor. In fact, we're 30 days past it. But nevertheless, it caused some customers to hold off on ordering from ResMed during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past approach to this topic, we have not given a timeline and we do not intend to discuss the details of our plans for our next-generation sleep flow generator platforms. And we are ready -- and when we are ready for full commercial launch, we will issue a press release. And before that, we will talk to our sales team so that they can talk to customers, whether they be physicians, providers or technicians.", "Looking at the masks and accessories category. Sales were lower in the quarter compared to Q4 2013 due to 3 factors: one, variations in customer-buying behavior, as we just talked about; and two, the continued year-over-year impact of new pricing structures that we introduced during Q3, as we also just talked about; and three, the transition to our new generation of masks, the AirFit series.", "So as we regain market share and ramp-up on the AirFit series, that is part of the complication. Specifically, we have seen good adoption of our AirFit P10 product in the pillows category since its launch in January. Additionally, we just launched the AirFit N10 and the AirFit F10, respectively, in the nasal and full-face categories during the fourth quarter. So our results for Q4 only include partial quarter sales for those products.", "We expect that the F10 and the N10 will ramp-up swiftly over the next few quarters, and they have had a very solid start. Physician, HME customer and patient feedback has been excellent on the whole AirFit series: the P10, the N10 and the F10. It's important to note in this mask category that we have a relatively high comparable growth hurdle from Q4 fiscal '13, which was tough to overcome, especially with the brand-new ramp-up of the F10 and the N10.", "As you may remember from our call last October, we promised to launch 3 new mask systems during the back half of fiscal '14, and we have delivered on that promise. With the global launch now of the AirFit family of masks, ResMed continues to lead in product innovation, particularly in this mask category. We have quieter, lighter, less-obtrusive and easier-to-fit masks than ever before. We expect the mask product categories to perform very well in fiscal '15.", "On the diagnostics front, we continue to see an increase in home sleep testing, and we expect that trend to continue as sleep labs expand their diagnostic options. North of 60% of sleep labs now offer home sleep testing in addition to polysomnography, and approximately 40% of U.S. diagnoses in the last 12 months were through home sleep testing as insurers and insurance company colleagues continue to drive that trend.", "Finally, on the Americas. We are seeing strong traction of our healthcare informatics offerings. EasyCare Online continues to expand its reach, and U-Sleep is rapidly increasing its penetration of accounts.", "U-Sleep's core value proposition is to increase patient adherence while also lowering HME labor costs by up to 60%. In a fast [ph] competitive bidding world, this type of cost reduction and efficiency improvement is a necessity for our home care provider customers. The ability for U-Sleep to text, email and to use interactive voice response, or IVR, has been well received by patients and helps coach them on their treatment journey. The net result is increased adherence, which is good for everyone in the supply chain and the value chain. The bottom line, the improving market conditions, new product flow and informatics solutions should enable us to significantly improve our Americas sales as we move through fiscal year 2015.", "Moving on now to sales outside of the Americas. Our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions were bright spots in the quarter, especially with respiratory care and cardiology sales. Growth in these regions, particularly strong in Europe, partially offset our Americas performance, bringing us to a flat global headline result.", "The benefit of having around 50% of our revenue outside the U.S., particularly in tough times like this in the U.S., was well exhibited during fiscal year '14 and especially during Q4. We launched the Astral life support ventilator in Europe and Asia during the quarter. Although it is still very early in the life cycle of the life support ventilator, the Astral has demonstrated very good traction during Q4. Astral is ramping up even faster than we expected, and its value proposition in this platform has been presented to physicians, providers and patients across the regions.", "Customer demand is growing very rapidly, and we are ramping up our operational ability to deal with that increased demand. We are excited about the prospects for this platform in FY '15 globally.", "Our gross margins came in at the high end of our expectations in the fourth quarter. We continue to manage the key parts of the P&L that are in our control, including initiatives to lower product costs and COGS and to leverage our global manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.", "Now I'd like to spend some time talking about the progress against our Three Horizons growth strategy. We're continuing to innovate in our First Horizon, which is focused on our core sleep-disorder breathing business.", "During the fourth quarter, we completed a detailed review and then made changes within our commercial and R&D teams to do 2 things: one, to better align those resources and teams with our strategy; and two, to further increase the efficiency of our overall business and SG&A. Brett will go into further details regarding the restructuring charge we took during Q4 as part of those changes.", "Additionally in our First Horizon, we have been taking actions to enforce our intellectual property throughout the fiscal year. During the fourth quarter specifically, we incurred significant SG&A legal costs as 2 of those cases went to trial. Those efforts also produced some early wins on the legal front. We don't like to be in court. We prefer to be in the design labs and talking to customers, but we like it even less when we believe our competitors are copying our inventions and infringing our intellectual property.", "When we are in court, we like to have some battle victories, even if they're a smaller part of a larger campaign. These last few weeks have seen 2 victories for ResMed over a small Taipei-based competitor. The first win was in the U.S. in the International Trade Commission, where the ITC ruled that, despite a redesign of its iCH CPAP device, the Taiwanese device manufacturer continued to infringe ResMed's humidification patents. Also in Germany, we won a permanent injunction against the same manufacturer, prohibiting sales of infringing headgear used on 2 of its mask systems. The judgment was entered by the Regional District Court in Munich, is appealable and covers the entire jurisdiction of Germany.", "In today's more dynamic and competitive market, we're committed to innovating and providing solutions to our customers while improving patient outcomes and reducing costs for global healthcare systems. We invest 7% to 8% of our revenue back into R&D, and we're choosing to defend that innovation in court to ensure that we can continue to have the ability to innovate and, ultimately, make life better for millions and millions of untreated sleep apnea patients.", "We're also making progress against our Second Horizon of growth, which includes both the respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion opportunities. With the full product launch of our new Life Support Ventilator, Astral, in both Europe and Asia, we executed against that plan during Q4. Also during the fourth quarter, we received FDA clearance for the Astral for the U.S. market, and we are expecting to execute that launch before the end of this calendar year.", "On the geographic expansion side, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, and we had strong growth this quarter in these geographies, particularly in the countries of Brazil, India and China. We intend to remain focused on geographic expansion to drive growth within these countries and also other important emerging markets.", "Our Third Horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory and other new market opportunities. SERVE-HF, our 1,325-patient clinical trial in heart failure has now been fully enrolled for 15 months. Our partners in SERVE are focused on event-driven data collection in the clinical trial size. We currently expect the first publication from this study during calendar year 2016. As this is a completely blinded trial, we will not know the results until the first part of the study is released late calendar year 2015. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached.", "During the quarter, I visited Professor Martin Cowie, who is the Cardiologist, Principal Investigator of SERVE-HF based in London at the Brompton.", "In summary, the clinical trial appears to be running very smoothly from a logistics perspective, which is a very good sign at this stage of a large clinical trial.", "Also from Europe on the clinical front, there has been some recent encouraging data on the use of noninvasive ventilation and its impacts on mortality for COPD patients. In this study recently published in Lancet, Dr. Thomas K\u00f6hnlein and colleagues found that the long-term use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for patients with hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a substantial improvement in both survival and quality of life.", "With the use of effective noninvasive ventilation, 1-year mortality was 12%. This compares to 33% in the control group, leading to a relative mortality reduction of 76%. This is quite an astounding result from the largest study of its kind. This augurs well for future growth of our respiratory care business.", "During the quarter and for the full year, we have continued to generate strong cash flow, and we maintain our commitment to return that cash to shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 a share, which represents a 12% increase from the previously declared quarterly dividend of $0.25. This is the second consecutive increase since we began paying a dividend in September 2012.", "In addition, we ended the year having repurchased 4.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $208 million for the year. We plan to continue with a strong capital management campaign for fiscal year 2015.", "At a broader level for fiscal year 2015, we are expecting to see top line constant currency revenue growth improvements as we continue to drive innovation with the launch of the new products in both our core sleep and our new and emerging respiratory care markets. The sleep disorder breathing markets remain underpenetrated with continued growth in patient volumes. Clearly, short-term market conditions in the U.S. are tough right now, and we will continue to carefully manage our expenses in that geography while appropriately funding our long-term growth initiatives globally.", "In the U.S. market, we are seeing the annualization of CB2, which is the biggest round of competitive bidding, and this augurs well for ongoing channel stability and patient volume growth in the U.S. In the Europe and Asian regions, patient volume growth has been strong in Q4, and we expect it to remain so throughout fiscal year 2015.", "Here at ResMed, we lead the industry with innovative product offerings, and we see ample opportunity to drive revenue growth through solid execution of those new product launches. The solutions will bring value to our customers in FY '15. We will reduce costs for broken healthcare systems that badly need our help and also improve the lives and the quality of life for millions and millions of undiagnosed patients of sleep-disordered breathing, COPD and cardiorespiratory disease.", "We have exciting plans for fiscal year 2015 with new products, services and solutions. In fact, I would say that we have the most-exciting product pipeline that I have seen in the last 14 years here at ResMed and probably in our 25 years of existence. Our team can't wait to bring that value to customers globally.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the June quarter was $415.2 million, consistent with the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, revenue decreased by 1%.", "At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $214.9 million, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $200.3 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, sales outside the Americas increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $99.3 million, a decrease of 5% over the prior year quarter, reflecting continued pricing pressures in a tough prior year comparable. Masks and other sales were $115.6 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior year quarter, reflecting very competitive environment. We expect an improvement in our mask trajectory in fiscal year 2015, as our recently launched masks continue to gain traction in the market.", "For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $136 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant-currency terms, an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $64.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, and in constant-currency terms, an increase of 4%.", "Globally, in constant-currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 1%, while masks and other decreased by 4%.", "Before I move to the P&L commentary, I would like to take a moment to walk you through the charges that were excluded in our non-GAAP earnings per share. We have excluded the impacts of the restructuring charge this quarter and the onetime Sydney University charge in the prior year quarter. As a result, non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter was $104.8 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior year quarter. And non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $92 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter.", "Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.64, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, was $0.66 for the quarter.", "Now on a GAAP basis, net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.61. Gross margin for the June quarter was 62.9%, down sequentially from Q3 FY '14.", "On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin benefited from favorable foreign currency movements, a favorable geographic mix, and manufacturing and supply chain improvements, partially offset by ASP declines. For fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 63%, assuming current exchange rates. We continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.", "Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $122.2 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. In constant-currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 6%, primarily due to higher legal expenses associated with patent litigation. Excluding these legal expenses, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 3% year-over-year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 27.8%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 28% to 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $31.8 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year quarter or 3% in constant-currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.7% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.6%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy.", "During the quarter, we incurred a restructure charge of $6.3 million, resulting from the reorganization of our commercial and research and development teams, primarily in our Sydney and San Diego locations. The restructure charge included severance payments made to employees. This is a discrete charge, and we've expensed the full amount of $6.3 million in our fourth quarter results.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.4 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.8 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects the tax benefit from the restructure charge and the ongoing benefit of lower effective tax rate associated with our Singapore manufacturing operations.", "Excluding the impact of the restructure charge, our full year effective tax rate was 20.1%, and we currently estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 will be in the vicinity of 21%.", "Cash flow from operations was $115.6 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and working capital management. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.5 million, while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $19.8 million.", "Our share repurchases continue to play a major role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares, a consideration of $40.4 million, and we ended fiscal year 2014 having repurchased 4.4 million shares for a total consideration of $208 million. This represented approximately 3.1% of total shares outstanding.", "At the end of June, we had approximately 18.3 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. This represents a 12% increase over our previously declared dividend and demonstrates our commitment to delivering shareholder returns through our capital management program. Indeed, as of fiscal year 2014, we returned 110% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to maintain an active share repurchase program in fiscal year 2015.", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $605 million. At June 30, total assets stood at $2.4 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Andrew Goodsall from UBS.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm going to assume that you won't [indiscernible] grab the new product. So perhaps, I can just ask the extent to which you think the deferrals impact -- impacted in the quarter in anticipation of that product. And if I can just throw a tricky one in just quickly ask just also the impact of FX on gross margin or masks on -- just what influenced the gross margin increase as well.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll take the first part of the question and, Brett, you'll take the second. Very hard to understand exactly the extent to which the circulating rumors impacted our flow generator sales in the Americas. It was really just in the U.S. and just from a couple of competitors. But it was reasonably broad spread. It wasn't just 1 territory or 2 territories. I know some executives were traveling in the field during the quarter who told me they heard it from every customer, and so it was pretty broad. Understanding the depth of that impact and how it specifically hits our numbers in terms of flow generator growth in Q4 is very hard to say. The good news is that our news from the field is that patient volumes as the channel has stabilized now with the annualization of CB2, that the patient volumes are there. And so, therefore, a missed sale in Q4 should lead to, throughout fiscal '15, as the inventories were quiet and patients continue to come through the channel that we start to get those back. It won't be immediate, but Andrew, I'm sorry, it's just very hard to quantify exactly what the impact of it would be, but it was there. It was probably, slightly material in some aspects in terms of the U.S. sales. Brett, you want to take the second half of the question?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, sure. Andrew, yes, on FX on gross margin, year-on-year, it was in the order of 150 basis points favorable for us. If you looked at it more on a sequential basis, it was a benefit of around 30 basis points for us. And then currencies where they are just on a -- if you look at Q1 like going forward, it would probably have a -- we'll have a headwind of around, probably, 30 to 40 basis points going into Q1. Yes.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And to what extent do you think your AirFit 10 mask sales picked that margin up as well?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "It's just -- it'd be pretty small, really, Andrew. I mean, they only just came through in the quarter. So really, at the early stages of traction in those new masks. So I think that'll manifest more through FY '15.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "So let's talk about masks in the U.S. And you guys have high market share, obviously, you're a juicy target even with the great new products coming through. This is not a great mask number. What happened there? I mean, because obviously, you're still selling the older mask through the bulk of the quarter, and then the new one is starting to roll out, but what are you seeing competitively there? You mentioned bulk versus kind of regular way, but maybe just give us a little bit more flavor on U.S. masks.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Ben. So, I mean, there are 3 factors that affected U.S. masks. One, is the variations in customer-buying behavior, right? Moving from a bulk order to a throughout the year type of steady behavior, which is tough short-term better in the long term. Two, there's the impact of the Q3 pricing reductions that we put in place, so they'll need to roll through the comparisons over a 12-month period of time in terms of the pricing impact. And three, there's the impact of the transition to our new masks. We've just launched the N10 in the nasal space and the F10 in the full-face space, literally during the quarter, so you only got a half-quarter of sales or so from those 2 products in the category. So they're the 3 major effects. You mentioned the fourth effect, which is there in terms of the competitive dynamic. And there are some reasonable masks from our competitors. They're not as good as ours, but we do compete out there, and it's a tough market at times, but we think that with the product portfolio that we've just launched, this AirFit series that over FY '15, we have very strong possibilities for not only maintaining but growing share and rising with the market there.", "Ben Andrew - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I guess I'll stick to one follow-up and just ask directly, did pricing get worse in the fourth quarter versus third quarter? Or was it the same? And do you think you gained or lost share in masks in the fourth quarter in the U.S.?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Well, that was technically 2 follow-up questions, Ben. But I think that the price changes that we put into place in Q3 were reasonably effective and, probably, just went broader to more customers during Q4 so relatively stable on the price side from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, on a year-on-year basis, there was a significant price relief for our customers that, of course, we don't quantify now on these calls. To your question about market share, it's very hard by each category to get the details of market share in categories. What I can say is that it's early in the ramp curve of the N10 and F10, so my conjecture would be that the N10 and F10 have a lot more runway to get market share over FY '15. And that if there's any market share gain in Q4, it would have been in the pillows category. If there were any stresses, it would have been in the nasal and full-face category. But that's sort of just based on the timing of those product launches and where they are. And thanks for the 3 questions, Ben.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Low from Deutsche Bank.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Mick, could I just start with the [indiscernible], just get you to perhaps talk to us about change. Then, I guess, the question that comes out of that is if you've seen a hit in Q4, presumably, we start to see a benefit, particularly in the first quarter when things are typically a little weaker.", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, you were a little light at the start of that question. Could you repeat the whole question? I couldn't quite hear you.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Let me try again. So the change in buying patterns that you talked about with major customers, I just want to understand what changed, and then, therefore, what the impact's going to be in the future. Most notably, it seems to me that Q4 is the strong quarter when there is a lot of deals done towards the end of the period. So presumably, we see some benefit from this changed pattern, particularly in Q1. Is that reasonable?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So good question, David, so more granularity on the changing buyer behavior. So what we're referring to is that, sometimes, during the quarters, whether it's Q1, Q2 or Q3, but particularly in Q4, there are larger bulk purchases by, usually, larger customers towards the end of the quarter. And we saw those throughout fiscal year '14, Q1, 2 and 3 but not in Q4. And I mean, the difference between missing or hitting on the U.S. sales could be 3 or 4 deals to sort of make up that difference. And if you think about 4 deals of in that sort of $3 million to $5 million range, you can start to see those types of numbers adding up. The question of why those deals didn't happen in Q4 and why the customers are choosing probably to have a lower inventory stake or a more-efficient operation, I think the answer is that they've all faced the reality now of 12 months of -- in particularly in the U.S. market, 12 months of competitive bidding round 2 impact. And everybody in the space is looking for efficiency, for supply chain efficiency, for ordering efficiency and for making sure that their -- that operations are delivered to patients, but they don't have excess inventory. So I think it was part of that, and it came to a head in Q4. I don't think the wash-through is a 90-day wash-through. I think the wash-through on an inventory supply chain, when you start to look at it as more a 365-day timeframe. It's total conjecture because I don't know the details of the operations of the 5,000 customers in the U.S. or even the top 50 to that great level of detail. But my conversations with top customers in the U.S. are that they're looking for operational efficiency. They're looking to take costs out. For instance, that's why U-Sleep has been so popular not only in Q4 but throughout the whole year because people say if I can increase adherence by 10 percentage points and take labor costs out by 60%, that's the technology I need. So I'll start using then: EDI technologies, just-in-time delivery, dropships to patients. All these types of things are being used by our customers. So there -- that's sort of the summary of that 50,000 feet of changes in buying behavior. And I just don't have the granularity on a 10-, 45-, 90-day scale, but my best guess is that it's a 365-day sort of adjustment that you'd have if you're running a large business on that front.", "David Low - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just one follow-up then. Brett, the legal cost looks to me like sort of close to $4 million based on the comments you made about growth in SG&A. What should we expect going forward? Are we going to see further legal costs of that magnitude in Q1, Q2? Or is it going to come down?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "I mean, to some extent, it depends on timing of court cases, trials and so on. I mean, there'll be -- you can expect there'll be some continuation of litigation costs through FY '15. I mean, the main thing is we're committed to protecting our patents in the marketplace and our innovation. So we'll continue to do that. And if that means we spend some money on litigation from time to time, then we'll certainly do that. There'll be some come through. It was -- this quarter, we did have a court case, which was kind of happening in that quarter, so it probably popped it a little bit. You could expect some base litigation, I think, will continue for next few quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Saul Hadassin from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a quick question on U-Sleep if I could. There's been some discussion more recently about the compatibility of some of the other manufactured devices across that platform. Can you just clarify, Mick, whether all manufactured products are still compatible with the U-Sleep product?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. So I think the question is whether U-Sleep is compatible with all manufacturers' products, and the answer is yes. The technology is perfectly capable of taking data from all manufacturers who are able to get data to the cloud that can interface with an API that can be accepted by our product, which is all the major manufacturers' capabilities. So U-Sleep is perfectly technically capable.", "Saul Hadassin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great. Just a follow-up. So you published that study quite recently, the abstract about the labor cost base. Can you talk to how effective that's been in terms of driving some higher U-Sleep subscriptions?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Look, without going -- because we don't go into detail of individual customers, but what I can tell you is that, that presentation at the American Thoracic Society from the main stage and then some posters and some follow-up with customers created some great buzz amongst key opinion leader physicians because they see that the world of telemedicine is coming. Digitized data is here to stay, and that efficiency is needed for our global healthcare system. So the key opinion leaders are on board. Specifically, as we talk to customers, particularly in the U.S. with all the price pressures they've had, particularly from CMS, they're really looking, as I said earlier, for efficiency tools. And the data in that study were 59% reduction in total labor costs. And if you're running your P&L and you look at what that reduction on that line is, even if you halve it, say, that was a clinical study, in practice, I'm only going to get half of that. It's a huge potential cost savings for customers. So what we've seen is a lot of customers asking about it. Our territory managers and our corporate account managers are talking to customers about it every day, and we're seeing good uptake from those customers who are doing pilots and trials. Obviously, it's sort of an S curve of penetration for anything, whether it's a mask, a software product or a new platform. But a software platform, when it goes, it can go pretty fast because it's very scalable and it's digital, and that's how it's designed. We're very excited. It's early days, but we're very excited about U-Sleep and the value it can bring to our channel, particularly the providers but also the patients. Patients just love being coached and engaged on their therapy. And moving adherence from 73% to 83%, as was shown in that study, may not sound like much, 10 percentage points, but for 7 out of 10 to 8 out of 10, that's a big needle move when you look at what pharmaceutical compliance rates are in the 50s and 60s at best with all the coaching materials they had. The difference is that we have electromechanical device that we can send data to the cloud, and we can coach that patient on what actually happened not whether we think they took the pill or opened the cap. So we're pretty excited about U-Sleep and its penetration, and we can give updates as we go through FY '15.", "Operator", "The next question is from Eric Fong from Bank of America.", "Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mick, can I ask for an update on the Japanese market? And as my follow-up, can I confirm whether you are assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '14 as was in FY -- sorry, FY '15 as was in FY '14 in respect of your gross margin guidance?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Sure. Rob, do you want to take the question on Japan, maybe both the questions. Rob?", "Robert Douglas", "Sure. The -- in Japan, as we've constantly said, Japan does stay a lumpy market given the business structure of our few customers there. This quarter, we had a pretty good run at it, and the business goes there. And Japan remains a very, very good market for us with good patient reimbursement and a good opportunity because we think we can still get a lot more patients in that market. In particular, our cardiology products continue to do very well there. Sorry, Eric, your second question on pricing, could you repeat what you said?", "Eric Fong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It was on gross margin guidance. So are you assuming the same level of market discounting in FY '15 as was in FY '14, the guidance of 61% to 63%?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. Maybe I can take that, Eric. On the gross margin, yes, I mean, we're guiding 61% to 63%. If you look at the price and if you look at it year-on-year, certainly, with the pricing or some of the adjustments we've made in Q3 that'll wash through Q4, and you're seeing that year-on-year impact, that year-on-year impact that will still be with us through, if you like, the first half Q1, Q2. So we'll still see those year-on-year price declines if you like. And then -- but when you look at the second half and a lot of that would sort of anniversary in terms of some of those adjustments. So now we're not going to make any predictions on where pricing might head that far into the future. But think of it at that first half, we got a wash-through. Second half might be kind of more normal with the caveat that, that's going to be unpredictable, really.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan.", "Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just wanted to get you to clarify that restructuring charge of $6.3 million, where that fits and whether or not there's any likelihood of ongoing restructuring charges going into fiscal '15.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. Steven, by where that fits, what do you mean", "[indiscernible] ?", "Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So what sort of -- just where -- what line item would we be looking up if we were trying to normalize that.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, so it would be -- it's a combination around SG&A and R&D, probably a little more skewed on the SG&A side for that if you're thinking about that. And at the moment, I mean, it's important for us to keep looking at making sure we're doing things as efficiently as we can. It's important for us to make sure our resource allocation is really focused on achieving strategic objectives. So we'll do that. But at this -- right at the moment, we've not -- there's no plans on the table for further restructuring. But we need -- yes, we need to continue to make sure we're operating the business as efficiently as we can.", "Steven David Wheen - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, okay. And just back to that comment on Japan, Rob, if -- there was some issue with one particular distributor that had sort of slowed down quite significantly. Have you got any update on the way they're seeing that market and whether or not they're sort of back to sort of full run rate?", "Robert Douglas", "Yes. Look, Steve, we don't really want to break out customer by customer data, and Japan's interesting because there's only a few of them as we said. But pretty well, I'd stick with what I was saying, that the underlying business remains pretty strong. We had talked to some issues around -- similar with other markets around inventory policies and stuff like that, but we think that the business will go forward on a pretty steady basis. And the patient flow's really solid there, so that creates the underlying demand for the products.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Alex Smith from Citigroup.", "Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You mentioned in the U.S., the patient volumes are there. Can you give us an estimate of what you think's going on at the market level in terms of market growth rates in terms of volume?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Alex. I'll hand that question to Jim.", "James Hollingshead", "Yes. Alex, we think that patient growth rates are about in line with where they've been. We haven't seen a big dropoff in patient diagnostics in any way. We don't actually name the percentage growth rate on this call anymore. We stopped doing that a couple of quarters ago, but we haven't seen any measurable decline in patient volumes in the U.S.", "Alexander Evans Smith - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, so really, the dynamics you're seeing are around price and share. You're not really seeing a huge change to underlying demand.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, it's the flow-through of the Q3 price changes. It's the changing in the buying behaviors of customers from more bulk to more steady and some of the channel changes that have happened throughout competitive bidding round 2 that have impacted, all together, those 3 factors have impacted the U.S. growth results there in Q4.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Two questions really. One is you talk about revenue next year being greater than this year. Could you ballpark what greater means? And then my second question is CMS has introduced a pilot program for bundling products. Could you please comment on that?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Sure. Thanks, Joanne. I'll take the first part, and then Dave Pendarvis can take the second part regarding CMS. Yes, Joanne, we don't give guidance with regard to revenue. We are going to improve. Globally, we're going to improve in the Americas for FY '15 because the macro conditions are going to get better. CB2 is done, which is the largest round of competitive bidding. We're going to wash through the pricing changes from Q3. We're going to work with customers to take waste out, including moving from more bulk to more day-to-day sales as best we can, and we're going to manage that volatility. So with all of that, we know the needle is going to normalize, and we're going to move the needle in the right direction. Dave, you want to take the second part of the question, which is with regard to the CMS pilots that they're looking at?", "David Pendarvis", "Sure, Mick. Yes, thanks, Joanne. The -- it's a little hard to tell at the moment. What we've got is a proposed rule from CMS, which hasn't become a final rule. And the proposed rule itself is proposing pilots in about, I think, it's 16 markets as part of competitive bidding 3. Of course, the timing of the third round of competitive bidding is itself part of a proposed rule. It's not final yet, but assuming all these things go through, it would be sometime in 2016 that they would start piloting in some of the CB3 regions of some form of bundling. We don't know what form that'll take. And depending upon how it goes, we'll, obviously, react to it and help our customers operate with that kind of a model. So it's long ways off, remains to be seen how the final rules come out and then how the pilots come out. But we're familiar with bundling as it operates in different markets throughout the world. So we're confident that we'll be able to work with our customers and work through it as it gets rolled out and look forward to the pilots.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Clair from Piper Jaffray.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So the first one I just want to see, is there any way to quantify the change in buying behavior on the U.S. flow gen and mask results? And then if I'm hearing you right, you think that this will take a year to normalize?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. So David, difficult to quantify the exact one, and you're going to need a handful of customers to talk about changing a $3 million to $5 million end of quarter buying to others to have an impact. So we don't -- my answer to the question of how long it will take to wash through that changing in buying behavior, I don't know if it will be a rapid deployment of their sort of efficiency approaches and they can get it done in a 90-, 180-day period, or if it'll be a little bit beyond that. The 365 is the absolute outlier, right, because then it's annualized. It has to be less than that. The answer is we just don't know. It's -- how long is a piece of string on that? So you're asking me to quantify something that I -- it's dependent upon the psychology of the customer, and it's very hard to go. What we're doing with our U.S. customers is partnering with them across the board. Solutions like U-Sleep that we talked about to bring efficiency, products like Astral. When we launched this life support ventilator, which is the first life support ventilator we've ever launched in the U.S. market, during this calendar year, we're going to be bringing to them choice. The first time they've had choice in life support ventilation, and they're screaming for it. And we can't wait to bring that for them. And so we think that will bring some faster orders and maybe some upfront stocking orders as they need to stock, to train their staff and get them up to speed on a great life support ventilator. So there's so many factors, including the new masks and how quickly they roll up and what inventory's needed on those, but understanding the exact inventory policies of even the top 10, 50, 100 customers, let alone, the 5,000 in the U.S., is very difficult. So that's why, David, getting a specific quantification of the days of inventory rolled through on average across the customer base is just very difficult. I was sort of giving you the guardrails between 90 and 360. The answer is I don't know exactly where it'll be within that.", "David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up here, the reorganization, so what exactly did this entail? Why are you doing it now? And will there be any kind of disruption?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Jim, you want to take that?", "James Hollingshead", "Yes. Well, I can speak to the Americas reorganization. Really, the way to think about what we did in the Americas was to align with the strategy. And so without getting into great detail, we made some changes and some additions to the sales force in preparation for the launch of Astral. And then we made some changes to align across some business aisles [ph]. So we've done some things to better align the marketing organization and also to create better alignment between sales and marketing. So it was, obviously, a lot of, if you will, effectiveness moves and alignment with strategy there. In doing that, we also took the opportunity to look for efficiencies.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Don Darkin, do you -- Don, do you want to talk a little bit to some of R&D restructuring that we did and how that positions us for the future?", "Donald Darkin", "Yes, so we basically just shifted a few people around to really try and reshape the organization for some of the approaches we're moving into going forward. So apart from some minor reductions in some areas, we've -- we're reshaping and creating some new areas for targeting going forward.", "Michael J. Farrell", "So I mean, look, David, in net, we're talking less than 1% to 2% or around 1% to 2% of our global workforce here, not a huge amount. But it was important for us to refocus our team towards the strategy and to where we need to be in 2015 and towards our Three Horizons growth strategy. And so it was really around aligning our SG&A and aligning our R&D around those long-term strategies and making sure the long-term bets are all accounted for, and some short-term efficiencies can be gained where we no longer need to expand assets and resources.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bruce Du from CBA.", "Bruce Du - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division", "I just had a question around pricing. I guess it's more specifically to masks. You mentioned that you haven't really seen sort of a change from Q3 to Q4, but you're offering the sort of broader -- discounts more broadly. What are you seeing with regard to the pricing behavior of your competitors in 4Q? Have they changed much at all from Q3 to Q4? And do you anticipate yourselves potentially having to move again? Or has it been relatively stable?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Look, I think some of the competitive moves were more in Q1 and Q2 from our major competitors in the U.S. market associated around competitive bidding round 2. And our moves in Q3 were a response to maintain our appropriate premium over our competitors in that space, and so it was steady. Predicting what's going to happen in FY '15, I will predict there will be some price competition, but what I predict is when we launch our Astral product, which is the second of its kind, right, it'll be 1 of only 2 players in that market that price will not be the issue. It'll be about efficiency, long-term cost of ownership, the value and efficiency for the customer and the value to the patient of that life support ventilator. In our new masks, where you're able to get first-time fit and easier to fit and easy to use, those values become very important when you're looking at the full P&L of managing your HME business. So price is there, will always be there. Our job and job of our R&D teams, the job of our marketing teams is to produce and then position and then provide through the sales team that value to customers so that they can get the efficiency. And we're going to do that throughout FY '15.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I had a question around your -- on the balance sheet. The days sales outstanding seems to have gone up again, and I was perhaps a little bit surprised to see that go up given you've talked about some -- in absence of sort of end-of-quarter sales. So I just wonder if you can reconcile that for me.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes. Ian, that's, I mean, in particular in the U.S., there's some longer payment terms, I think, that are out in the market nowadays, really, on competitive response from us. And you'll see -- and obviously, that sort of doesn't manifest straight away but will build up over time. So you're seeing a little bit of that coming through in the days sales outstanding but not really -- it's kind of not really a factor or relation to some of the ordering cycles. It's really something that was put in place a while ago that then starts to manifest in days sales outstanding.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And as a follow-up, could I ask around some of the higher-end products? I'm not sure if you mentioned on the call whether the shift just from CPAP to APAP is still ongoing and also some of the high-end products in the bilevel segment, just how they've performed during the quarter and what the outlook for those is.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. So we alluded to it a little in the prepared remarks. Ian, you're the first question on it. But the home sleep testing is now at 40% when you look at a trailing 12-month period of all U.S. diagnoses, 60% being polysomnography. It's being driven by the insurers and specialty benefits managers and others associated with insurance companies driving that switch, and the channel is responding. When home sleep testing increases, it does almost directly impact the shift that is continuing between CPAP to APAP. And so we're continuing to see the APAP category increasing, and that did continue during the quarter. We didn't see any big major changes in Q4 for bilevel, pretty steady as a sort of -- as a percentage of total sales through there. The impact on all of them was the changing in buying behavior, the pricing and all the macro effects impact across all those segments. But within the individual CPAP versus APAP categories, we are seeing a positive mix shift from CPAP to APAP continuing, bilevels being steady. And as we launch the Astral life support ventilator, we will open up a brand-new category for us at the really highest end of the spectrum in terms of value and margin and value all the way through to the COPD patient, the neuromuscular disease patient that it might treat.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just a little bit, Mick, on the DME ordering patterns. Is there any, maybe, clarity you can give around all those long-term supply agreements where they've committed to purchase commitments? Or are they just in a position now where they're ordering based on their needs? And then one quick follow-up.", "Michael J. Farrell", "All right. I'll hand that to Jim regarding U.S. DME purchasing patterns.", "James Hollingshead", "Yes. I'd -- thanks, Anthony, for the question. This is going to sound like a bit of a clich\u00e9, but every customer is different. And so what we're seeing is a wide range of behaviors. We've got customers who are getting more aggressive about managing their own inventory balances. We have a wide range of different types of agreements. And so it's actually very difficult to characterize in the context and the way you framed it. But I think we can say that we did see, at the end of the quarter, a change in behavior with some of our customers in -- being more reluctant to do larger deals. And I do think that, that is hand-in-hand with some of the anticipation that's out in the market based on the rumor that was spread by one of our competitors that we were launching a product platform imminently. So those 2 things were connected. But it's very, very difficult to say because of the variety of behavior across the customer base.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up for Mick. Is -- previously you spoke on consolidation within the U.S. of DMEs, and that number was sort of in -- close to 8,000 and coming down a bit. You characterized that number lower. So I'm just wondering are we mostly kind of complete with consolidation in your view. Or is there still a little bit more to go?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes. Anthony, it's a good question, and it's hard to know the exact answer to it. I mean, we sold to more than 5,000 customers during Q4 just in the U.S. As Rob was talking to earlier, I can count on my right hand, less -- half of it the number of Japanese customers. And so yes, it's north of 5,000. Will there be more consolidation? I will expect some further mergers and acquisitions activity within the DME channel. I think quite a lot of it was pre-CB2 and during CB2. I think now it's almost the survival of the fittest. Those who have got through this year and have still got their cash flow and still got operating businesses and good relationships with referring doctors and good relationships with the patients who are members of their sort of portfolio, that they have the opportunity continue to do that. We're going to partner with all our customers: the small, the mom and pop, the medium regionals, the large regionals and the nationals. And we are helping all of them with efficiency. A lot of the tools we provide, such as U-Sleep, can apply to a customer across that spectrum. So we don't have to be a large customer to use it. Some of the others have sort of electronic data interchange and interfacing with their billing capability. We can do with -- through partnerships with some of the small guys and directly with some of the larger ones. So whatever the opportunity to bring value to all those segments of customers, we're looking at doing it. But to answer your question directly, do we expect further consolidation? Yes. Do we think it'll be dramatic? Probably not. Probably an ongoing quarter-by-quarter consolidation of them without a major step-change.", "Operator", "We are now at the 1-hour mark. I'll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Well, great. In closing, I'd like to thank the more than 4,000 ResMed employees, who sometimes listen to this call, around the world, for their contribution to the world-leading respiratory medical inventions that position us for the future. And we're going to continue to execute against our Three Horizons growth, and we're very excited about the product pipeline that you guys have developed and we get to launch during fiscal year '15.

My name is Larissa, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Larissa, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast today. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our Chief Executive Officer; and Brett Sandercock, our Chief Financial Officer. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it could be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, and performance.", "We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today\u2019s investor call as we provide an overview of our first quarter fiscal year 2015 results.", "I\u2019ll provide an update on our new product launches, some key sales highlights and our progress against our Three Horizons strategy. Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.", "As we promised during our investor call last quarter, the ResMed team has been focused on executing on our strategy of launching new products, new services and new solutions that provide exceptional value to all key players in our value chain. That includes physicians, providers, payers and most importantly patients.", "We have delivered exciting offerings that begin to fulfill the promise in our core sleep apnea market with the launch of the Air Solutions ecosystem and its key enabling component, the AirSense 10 platform.", "We are very pleased with our strong first quarter growth and our overall results. We saw strength across our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, as well as solid growth in the Americas. These results are primarily due to the success of our new product launches in both the sleep disorder breathing and our respiratory care markets, which includes COPD as well as neuromuscular diseases.", "On a constant currency basis, we grew 6% year-over-year for our global business in Q1. We delivered gross margins of 62.4%, which is right near the middle of our guidance range. We have continued to invest SG&A to promote our new product launches. As you\u2019ve seen from our recent press releases, we have launched products across our portfolio, including sleep apnea, sleep wellness and respiratory care.", "Our GAAP diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.58. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share was a $0.01 higher at $0.59. In the first quarter, we grew at 11% on a constant currency basis across our combined Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.", "Sales growth came from flow generators associated with our new product launches, as well as masks and accessories. With the launch of the AirSense 10 platform in its early days, we see upside in Europe and Asia-Pac as both the AirSense 10 and our new Astral platforms continue to ramp.", "In the respiratory care market, our leadership positions and our established channel in Western European countries have allowed us to rapidly grow our business and build good momentum with the launch of our new life-support ventilator, the Astral platform.", "We expect this momentum to continue solidly in Europe over the coming quarters and fiscal years. Additionally, we are continuing to invest in Asia-Pacific. This quarter we took advantage of opportunities to realign our distribution channels in several Asia-Pac markets, and we have started investing in a dedicated Asia growth initiative with a focus on China and India. We are planning for strong growth from China and India, as well as emerging markets, including Brazil and Eastern Europe during fiscal 2015.", "Moving on to Americas results, we had a very solid performance this quarter from the region. With the America sales team achieving a 10 percentage point growth turnaround from Q4 to Q1, resulting in 3% growth for the region in Q1 on a year-on-year basis.", "We are seeing U.S. patient volumes growing in both flow generators and mask categories. We are very pleased with the initial progress of our U.S. flow generator product launches. I\u2019ll talk first about our sleep apnea category product platform, the AirSense 10, and then I\u2019ll talk about our new respiratory care platform, the Astral.", "We have received very positive feedback from our customers for AirSense 10, and although it is still early days, our sales are ramping up quickly, exceeding our original expectations.", "As a result of this excess demand, we ended the quarter with a modest backlog for some categories of AirSense 10 devices in the Americas. We are swiftly accelerating our manufacturing and supply chain, and we believe that we will catch our supply curve up to that growing demand curve during this fiscal quarter Q2.", "In September, we also announced the launch of our new life-support ventilation platform, the Astral, into our U.S. market. The Astral platform has some of the most advanced engineering that ResMed has produced, delivering key advantages for customers such as lower total cost of ownership for HME providers and increased battery life, which means up to 24 hours of freedom for patients.", "We have received good feedback from our HME customers and our key opinion leader physicians on the Astral product, and we look forward to growing our U.S. life-support ventilation presence with Astral.", "Moving back to the sleep apnea market, the ongoing product mix shift from CPAP to APAP continues steadily as home sleep testing continues to grow. We estimate that approximately 40% to 45% of diagnoses in the last 12 months in the U.S. were through home sleep testing.", "Almost every player in the industry from sleep physicians to HME providers expect that private insurance companies will continue to drive this trend above 50% in the near future and beyond.", "Looking at the masks and accessories categories, our AirFit range of masks had solid volume growth in the quarter. We gained share on a sequential basis. Customer feedback on the P10, N10 and F10 has continued to be excellent.", "On a sequential basis, volumes were up, and prices were relatively stable in masks. On a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re still annualizing price changes from earlier this calendar year. As a reminder, we are still expecting price to be a negative factor for year-on-year revenue numbers until the quarter ended March 2015. The anniversary of price adjustments that we made earlier this calendar year.", "Now, I\u2019d like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our Three Horizons strategy. In our first horizon of growth, we\u2019re driving engineering and innovation with the launch of our Air Solutions ecosystem and its key component, our AirSense 10 platform.", "We expect our bilevel range of devices, which we will call the AirCurve 10 platform, to launch in the U.S. by the end of this calendar year and then into other key markets globally thereafter. We\u2019re expanding our digital informatics offerings by increasing the connectivity from our Air Solutions ecosystem to the informatics ecosystems of our customers.", "In September, we announced the integration of Air Solutions with Fairview Health Services and their Epic electronic health record system. This is just one example of ResMed looking to eliminate non-reimbursed costs from the value chain and to provide increased efficiency and profitability for our customers.", "We continue to look for opportunities to link our technology to streamline healthcare processes and to drive efficiencies for our partners in the channel. Earlier this week, we announced the availability of the ResMed Data Exchange program, enabling even more customers to integrate sleep and respiratory data into their own software systems.", "We want to liberate the data. Watch this space for further expansion of our healthcare informatics offerings for our partners, including HME providers, physician practices, hospital systems and beyond.", "At the Medtrade conference in Atlanta earlier this week, we demonstrated a new personalized therapy management tool, which we call myAir. myAir is delivered through web-based applications that can run on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Android platforms. myAir allows sleep apnea patients to see data about their positive airway pressure therapy and to improve their engagement in their own health care.", "This patient engagement tool could reduce or potentially eliminate non-reimbursed costs for our HME provider partners and could ultimately support better outcomes for their patients. myAir will be commercially available in the U.S. market next week, and then we will release it to other key markets in the future.", "We continue to believe that ignorance of the impacts of untrained sleep apnea is our major competitor in our first horizon of growth. So we are focusing even more are focusing even more attention on the importance of sleep quality for good health.", "In this vein, earlier this month, we launched two important sleep awareness initiatives. First, we launched an education- and product-focused campaign called Better Sleep for Women. As part of this campaign, we created a new website that educates women on how to achieve a better night sleep and to provide a forum for women to discuss their sleep issues.", "Women are 40% of the patients presenting for sleep diagnostics, and they are well over 50% of the decision-makers in the healthcare space for themselves and their families. This is true across healthcare and particularly in the sleep space.", "Our new AirSense 10 AutoSet for Her product with its unique patented algorithm designed for female SDB respiratory patterns is a key part of this offering. This is not just great marketing. It is also solid science. This product has been very well received in its early weeks on the market.", "The second initiative we launched is the world\u2019s first non-contact digital help device, which tracks both sleep quality, including light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep, and the bedroom sleeping environment, including temperature and light levels. The product is called the S+ by ResMed.", "The S+ by ResMed is a combination of a sleep wellness product and a sleep coaching service that delivers personalized sleep strategies to individuals. The S+ has a patented non-contact sleep sensor technology, as well as sophisticated cloud-based algorithms that are backed by solid sleep science.", "The data can be reviewed on a dedicated ResMed app, which runs on both Apple\u2019s iOS and Android compatible devices. The app itself is a free download from the cloud. The S+ by ResMed sleep wellness device is priced at $149.", "We\u2019ve made the S+ plus available in the U.S. market in the future at select Apple stores, as well as Bed Bath and Beyond stores, as well as online for U.S. customers at both Amazon and a dedicated site mysplus.com. That is all one word.", "The S+ has already been reviewed favorably in the Wall Street Journal, in Time magazine and on Fox television. We believe this tool can help engage some of the hundreds of millions of consumers around the world who have sleep issues and who want a sleep wellness tool to help them sleep better. We believe that it will create meaningful conversations about sleep between consumers and their caregivers and loved ones, as well as with expert clinicians and physicians.", "On the legal front in the first quarter, we reached a settlement with a small Taiwanese manufacturer called APEX. The agreement met our goals to protect our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and showed ResMed\u2019s strong defense of its intellectual property.", "We will continue to take actions to enforce our intellectual property and to defend the significant investment of approximately 8% of our revenues that we make into science and engineering within our global R&D team.", "We are also making progress within our second horizon of growth, which includes both our respiratory care market and new geographic market expansion. We have continued to see solid growth in our European respiratory care business where we have had a leading presence in home care ventilation for a number of years.", "We expect to grow Astral, and it will build on its momentum from Q4 in Europe as government insurers continue to see the value of moving patients from costly hospitals to economic and more patient-friendly treatment in the home. In September, we launched the Astral life support ventilator platform in the U.S. As I outlined before, we have received good initial feedback from customers.", "Combining our existing VPAP COPD noninvasive ventilation device and our new Astral life support ventilation device, we now offer our HME provider and pulmonary physician customers the opportunity to provide the right treatment at the right time for both COPD, as well as neuromuscular disease patients.", "On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets with double-digit growth this quarter. I traveled to our India national sales team meeting this month, and I\u2019ve got to tell you the energy level was palpable.", "Our country leader there, [Jito] (ph), and our entire India leadership team have an incredible outlook. Their commitment to real-time expanding the future growth targets during a sales meeting is something that I have not seen in over 14 years at ResMed and 20 years in the healthcare and technology industries.", "We intend to remain focused on geographic diversification with an emphasis on China and India, as well as emerging markets beyond Asia, including Brazil and Eastern Europe. So that in the future these markets become a material contributor for ResMed\u2019s global growth.", "Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory disease and other new market opportunities. In terms of current contribution, our cardiology products grew strongly in Europe this quarter. Even though it is now 18 months since enrollment was completed on SERVE-HF, we\u2019re still seeing excitement in this space and good partnerships in patient care between cardiology and pulmonary physicians.", "In terms of other ongoing clinical trials in heart failure, we are currently enrolling patients for our CAT-HF trial at sites across the United States. We expect to complete CAT-HF soon after the SERVE-HF trial data is first published, which we expect to happen during calendar year 2016.", "CAT-HF is powered to show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, whereas SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity with both studies using ResMed\u2019s proprietary, adaptive servo-ventilation technology. We\u2019ll continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached for both of these important clinical trials.", "It is worth noting that there continues to be clinical interest in positive airway pressure technology as a tool to help reduce the cost of care for cardiac patients. Dr. Richard Schwab and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center published a study last week in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine showing a reduction in hospital readmission rates for cardiac disease patients with adherence sleep apnea treatment.", "Reduction of hospital readmission rates costs \u2013 helps reduce costs and can help mitigate the reimbursement penalties that hospitals face when Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days of a discharge.", "I talked to a lot of hospital CEOs and CFOs, and they are looking at heart failure and they are looking at COPD patient readmission rates very closely. We know we can help them with technology that includes positive airway pressure and also technology that goes way beyond their future.", "Finally, on the capital management front, we continue to generate strong cash flow during the quarter, and we have maintained our commitment to return cash to you, our shareholders. We have just declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which is a 12% increase from our previous dividend.", "And during the quarter, we repurchased 835,000 shares at a cost of approximately $43 million. We plan to continue with a very strong capital management strategy throughout fiscal year 2015.", "Let me close with this. The next 12 months will be very exciting for our global ResMed team as we continue to ramp up the launches of the new products that we discussed here as well as others and new services and new solutions across our Three Horizons of growth.", "We continue to focus on improving patient quality of life, halting the progression of severe chronic diseases and lowering the costs of highly stressed healthcare systems around the world.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials and then to Q&A. Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Mick. As Mick has noted, revenue for the September quarter was $380.4 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 6%.", "At a more detailed level, overall sales in the Americas were $207.2 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Sales outside the Americas totaled $173.2 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales outside the Americas also increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas flow generator sales were $95.3 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $111.9 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter. For revenue outside the Americas, flow generator sales were $119 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter, and in constant currency terms also an increase of 15%.", "Masks and other sales were $54.2 million, an increase of 2% over the prior quarter and in constant currency terms a gain in increase of 2%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 12%, while masks and other were flat compared to the prior.", "Gross margins for the September were 62.4%. On a year -over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 130 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by manufacturing and supply chain improvements. Looking forward for the full fiscal year 2015, we expect our gross margin to be in 61% to 63% assuming current exchange rates.", "With respect to currency impacts on gross margin going forward, on a sequential basis and assuming current exchange rates, we expect to see a minor negative impact on gross margin as the impact from a weaker euro will be largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar. Finally, we continue to focus on initiatives targeted at improving our global manufacturing, supply chain and logistics cost structures.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $110.5 million, an increase of 9% over the quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 9%, primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with recent product releases, additional headcount to support commercial activities and an increase in variable, employee compensation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% compared to the year ago figure of28.3%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range 29% for fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $30 million, an increase of 10% over prior quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.9% compared to the year ago figure of 7.7%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to continue to be in the range of 7% to 8% particularly in 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials consistent with our strategy.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles is $2.1 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.4 million. Our effective tax rate for quarter was 18.3%. The lower tax rate this quarter reflects a net tax a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the favorable conclusion of long-running German tax audit. Excluding the impact of this one-time benefit, our effective tax was 21.5%.", "We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015, excluding the one time tax benefit will be in the range of 21% to 22%. Net income for the quarter was $83.3 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.58, an increase of 4% over the prior quarter. Excluding the benefit of the one-time tax item noted previously, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.56 consistent with the prior year quarter.", "Cash flow from operations was %86.5 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $20.7 million and depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $18.6 million.", "You will have seen we began including the cash flow statement with our earnings release this quarter. Many of you have mentioned it would be helpful to have that with the release, and we plan to continue to include that going forward. Our share repurchases continue to play a significant role in our capital management program. During the quarter, we repurchased $835,000 shares for consideration of $42.9 million. At the end of September, we had approximately $17.4 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. We do expect to maintain an active share repurchase program during fiscal year 2015.", "In addition to our share repurchases, our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $506 million and at September 30 total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.7billion. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn the call over to Q&A, and we ask that everyone remember to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Larissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Andrew, your line is now unmuted.", "Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.", "Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair", "Good afternoon, guys. So first for us, can you talk a little bit about how quickly the DMEs are responding to the new product features of the AirSense and that connectivity capability? Is it making the sales cycle longer? A little bit more detail there.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Margaret. You know, as we said, the AirSense 10 launch is going very well. It\u2019s exceeding our expectations. We\u2019ve received very positive feedback from our customers. To your question, the discussion around healthcare informatics and its use within the business of the homecare provider is a more detailed conversation and takes a little longer to have that discussion, but we also think it\u2019 that it provides a lo it provides a lot of value to the HME provider.", "Some of the value to the HME provider can be the fact that with the inbuilt modem, you no longer have to manage a set of SKUs of modems and connect them and manage a fleet of modems all the a fleet of modems all the way through to dealing with customers who have their customers \u2013 the patients who have may have problems with devices that can be instantly checked that the humidifier is working, say, from the HME provider to save that cost of $75 to $100 of driving out to see the patient or the customer tax that comes with the customer coming in.", "So there are just some of the simple ones. They are obviously a lot more advantages as we look at Air Solutions and the value we can provide with the end to end solution and providing value across the value chain. But even those initial discussions with HME providers do provide a great opportunity to get beyond features and benefits and start talking about end to end solutions.", "I\u2019ll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas. Do you have any further detail on the first months of AirSense 10?", "James Hollingshead", "Yeah, sure I would you say a couple of things, Margaret. It\u2019s not cycle devices are doing very, very well. The device is a fantastic device. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s very easy to set up, etcetera. But there is a sales cycle associated with then using the wide and growing range of solutions from a business process flow point of view for our customers. So the device is selling extremely well and we\u2019re in more and more conversations about how they can take our software solutions and embed those into their business process.", "Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. So maybe they are a little bit longer and so that can start to accelerate and take more shares as we go on throughout the year. But the (indiscernible) go ahead, sorry.", "James Hollingshead", "I just clarified. It\u2019s not taking longer. The devices are selling very well. What then is happening is when then is we are engaged in deeper conversations about using the device to its full effect along with our solutions. So there is some kind associated with that some kind associated with that conversation, and it is almost a solutions consultant conversation that comes on the backend. So the device sales have not slowed down at all. It\u2019s how they apply the solutions into their business that can take some time for them to embed and that part of it is what makes this so sticky.", "Margaret Kaczor \u2013 William Blair", "Got it. And then how much of the growth this quarter beyond the AirSense launch do you think was actually kind of the delayed sales from the man previous quarter that maybe got pushed into this quarter? Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think, we have a material breakdown of that. There were some S9 that we sold obviously during quarter, a significant component of the sales S9 devices. The AirSense 10 had a rapid ramp faster than we had expected, and a couple of the SKUs, the categories were on backorder at the end of the quarter. I\u2019m not sure, Brett, if we have a breakdown of any material change from Q4 to Q1 then. Brett, do you want to make any comments there?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "No, I think that\u2019s right, Mick. It would be hard to really know, if there was an impact what that impact would be. Certainly though when you look at AirSense and how it\u2019s gone the first two months, it\u2019s gone very well. But yes, I don\u2019t think we have tease out that impact.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Margaret.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Thanks very much for taking the question. I\u2019m sorry my phone had dropped out \u2013 maybe a bit repetitive. But actually I thought I might ask you quickly just on the launch of the bi-level range, just where you\u2019re at with that. Does that appear in the inventory build and whether you have had any effect in the quarter by not having that product out there?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Andrew, and good that your phone is working now. The bi-level products which we which we are calling the are calling the AirCurve 10, we did show at the Medtrade conference earlier this week in our U.S. market, and we will launch the AirCurve 10 before the end of the calendar year.", "So they are out there in the public environment. Given the competitive environment, we are not going to give the date or the level of inventory that we have or do not have of AirCurve 10 within our factories or our distribution warehouse. So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to go into that level of detail.", "But I can tell you, I\u2019ll stand behind what we showed at the conference and what we said at the AirCurve 10 will provide fantastic value. It will be part of the Air Solutions ecosystem, and we look forward to launching it in our U.S. market before the end of the calendar year.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "And I guess last time with the launch with the delays, obviously it was a prolonged delay last time. Don\u2019t you think there\u2019s any small levels of deferral that you\u2019ll experience between now and then?", "Michael J. Farrell", "You know, Andrew, given that we will be launching the AirCurve 10 within three months of the AirSense 10, we don\u2019t expect any dramatic holdovers on the bi-levels like we had from the S8 to S9 or the S9 to S9 bi-level timings. As you remember, those were more of the order of 24 months and 36 months respectively.", "So, we are talking three months. Any impact may have happened in Q1 where we had the Airsense 10 products and the CPAPs and APAPs but not the bi-levels. The bi-levels were still on the S9 platform. But we think it\u2019s relatively de-minimums, and we think going forward that the full value proposition we will have by the end of Q2 will be in the market, and we shouldn\u2019t be materially affected by that.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Okay. That\u2019s terrific. Thanks very much, and I\u2019ll get back in queue.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Andrew Goodsall \u2013 UBS", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you and your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan.", "Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan", "I just had a quick question for Brett on the currency effect on the gross margin for the current quarter. At the last quarter, you highlighted that there might be a small headwind. Are you able to quantify it? And then just talk to what sort of benefit we may have seen from the weakening of dollar and going into subsequent quarters. I take your point about the euro, but just if we could provide (inaudible) on that, relativity (inaudible) that would be useful.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, sure, Steve. Yes, if you look at our margin sequentially through Q4 to Q1, there was a currency headwind. It was around 50 basis points. So that certainly did impact our gross margin when you looked at it sequentially. If you look forward Q1 to Q2, we certainly have a headwind from the weaker euro, which is impacting revenues and then margin.", "If you look at that \u2013 I think, we that, we get a small headwind, it will probably I suspect be around the 40 basis point marks for that. As you know, the only dollar benefit tends to lag by a quarter or so. So more of that benefit would then flow through into Q3, we are infecting Q3; I think on a sequential basis, we get some more upside from currency because of the weaker Aussie. So that sort of plays out like that", "Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan", "Yeah, that\u2019s very useful. And then just separately a quick question on Japan. Been waiting for some \u2013 it has obviously been a market that has been a little bit disruptive over recent quarters. Could you just give some update as to what might be happening there?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Rob, our President and Chief Operating Officer will answer that.", "Robert Douglas", "Yes, thanks, Steve. So the fundamentals of the Japan market haven\u2019t changed dramatically. We still have a good patient flow. We still got a really good business with our cardiology product, and we\u2019re seeing strong product flow there. Because of the structure of the way we go to market, these are lumpy businesses it reflects in our sales. And this quarter we had a positive result from that lumpiness. But we will continue to see that lumpiness through there and we will have positive strong quarters, and that\u2019ll be offset periodically. It\u2019s pretty well going pretty well.", "Steve Wheen \u2013 JPMorgan", "Right, thanks very much.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. I was wondering if we could just touch on mask sales. So the numbers or the growth rate is relatively weak there and particularly in light of the fact that there\u2019s a number of new products being launched. Could you talk to what\u2019s causing the weakness with that new product range being out?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, David. Yeah I will mention three things and then maybe hand Don Darkin, President of our SDB business, to talk after that. First point, we saw volume growth in the quarter sequentially increase, and we expect that to continue as we ramp up. So we saw a sequential increase in volume from Q4 to Q1. Masks were down.", "Second quarter masks were down in Q1 on a year-on-year basis due to the lower prices that were washing through from the sort of January to March 2014 quarter that will happen January to March 2015 quarter. And so we are still expecting that to wash through on that time horizon.", "But the third point is we have seen really good traction of the AirFit range from the P10, which I personally wear and have been for a number of months, the N10 and the F10 and the growing share sequentially and the anecdotal feedback from customers is they really like those masks. So I think that augers well for us as we look to future volume growth and then future revenue growth as we look to our end of Q3 and Q4.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks. So you would classify that as \u2013 not off on share. It is more around price than it is share loss.", "Michael J. Farrell", "I\u2019d actually say we took share, David, from Q4 to Q1 on a sequential basis and that the year-on-year numbers you are looking at obviously we are watching through the price changes that have happened there. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d nuance that.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, Mick, and just maybe one for you, Brett, just on gross margins. You talked about there being a negative mix effect in there. Could you just touch on that whether you\u2019re talking geographic or products, please?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yes, that would be on the product side, Dave, and it\u2019s really that as you saw the kind of flow generator growth relative to the mask growth was the big driver there.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So would it not be right to say that geographically there was a positive mix effect?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yeah, if you look at year on year, yes, correct. But fairly \u2013 pretty small, pretty small.", "David Low \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning. First question maybe just for Brett. Brett, operating cash flow was actually down on the PCP. Earnings were up slightly. Can you just talk to what the drivers of that was? Is it receivable days that have increased on a PCP basis?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Yeah, that would be. Yes, these are around some modest increases in working capital on a relative basis. The receivables DSOs is little higher, and probably the other driver there would be some inventory build as well. So they are playing out with a modest increase in working capital, which has lowered cash flow a little bit. Having said that, I still think the $86.5 million is still pretty strong cash.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sure. Okay and just a separate question for Mick. Mick, October saw the introduction of the CMS penalties to hospitals with readmission rates, one of them being COPD. Are you starting to have any increased dialogue where engagement with those hospitals with regards to use of bi-levels in particular for management of COPD in the home?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Saul, that\u2019s a great question and actually leads into something I had in the prepared remarks, but COPD and heart failure together are two of the top readmission disease states for hospitals CEOs and CFOs as they look at this in the U.S. And yes, currently it\u2019s around a 30-day readmission cycle. And the penalties are significant and they go across the whole Medicare CMS reimbursement for that hospital. So this is real money that you\u2019re looking at. You have to be above the million, above the 50% mark for hospitals across the United States to not get a penalty. So it\u2019s a competitive game that gets more competitive as everyone gets better.", "We are certainly partnering with our hospital customers and our DME providers to make sure there is a strong hospital to home transition for those patients with COPD. The opportunity is twofold. It goes beyond just bilevel. The opportunity is our VPAP COPD, which is the bilevel noninvasive ventilation device and it\u2019s also for the Astral for the Astral, which is a life support ventilation device that can be used for both COPD and neuromuscular disease patients.", "So there\u2019s a right solution for the right patient at the right time that the hospital and the HME provider can get. And so we are partnering with discharge planners and hospital systems across the country. And frankly in the new world of ACOs, accountable care organizations, where hospitals and primary care now share per member per month budgets, we think the time is right to move we think the time is right to move on this, and we should see progress on this over the coming quarters and fiscal year because this is a long development cycle but again has stickiness as you look to that long term.", "Saul Hadassin \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the David Clair from Piper Jaffray.", "David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one for me, you guys have been very active on the informatics development recently. Can you just remind us how are these initiatives going to translate into revenue for ResMed?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Well, that\u2019s a great question, David, and I will hand the second part of Don Darkin, the President of our SDB business. But the informatics investment is a major one for us. As you can see with Air Solutions, which comprises both AirView, which is the combination of our EasyCare online, well as U-Sleep, as well as now myAir. You\u2019ve variety of applications that are primarily cloud based and can interface with HME providers, hospitals and also with U-Sleep to coach patients.", "These are major investments, and the way in which this connects through to revenue is that as for instance take one of the plays in the channel, an HME provider realizes they can save non-reimbursed costs by drive outs, pickups and no-fault balance with devices, they will want to adopt this new technology.", "And as they see its capabilities on that front, they will realize the value that they value that they get is far above the price that we are charging them for access to data points. And for us, taking weight out of the system and providing investment to get some return from that is also a positive economic argument. So it works for us, and it works for our HME providers.", "If you take another example the Epic hospital integrations with Fairview, not only is the HME providers that are involved there getting the benefit of reducing non-reimbursed costs, but the hospital system that is looking to manage say the COPD readmits or say their accountable care organization, total economic or total cost of ownership or total patient management approach, they can find both a clinical and economic value out of that And that should for us lead to more share and more stickiness with those hospitals, HME providers, patients throughout the value chain. Don, anything to add beyond that regarding our healthcare informatics investments and any connection to revenue.", "Donald Darkin", "Yes, David, the broader issue here would be to look at it, like a Kindle. If you think about how people will select the best conditions for whether they are a large HME or a small HME in running too many realizations of revenue from troubleshooting. You want to roll the truck to check if whether unit is working or not.", "You will be looking at share shift on big customers to who want to get more units into that solution into end. The compliance programs will drive more usage, usage, better outcomes for the patient, better outcomes for the HME. This will also then drive programs for accessories, which will again increase better patient compliance and a better business for the HME.", "So there\u2019s a multitude of areas here notwithstanding the actual costs coming out of the actual value chain and increasing profitability for the customers as well. And they are all on top of any sort of flat fees that may be paid for purely phone usage either way. So it\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. It will reflect itself in many, many ways, in many, many countries.", "David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thanks for the answer, guys. Just a quick one on emerging markets for my follow-up. I\u2019m just curious are you planning on selling the same products in emerging markets or you\u2019re going to be launching low cost, low wear cost alternatives?", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, great question. I\u2019ll hand that to Rob Douglas", "Robert Douglas", "Thanks, David. So the emerging markets have got quite lot of different dynamics in them. Each one of them is complex as any of the other markets. Some of them are actually high price markets and some of them are lower price markets. And then they\u2019ve got different medical reimbursement schemes and different system.", "So it is less focused on compliance management than in developed countries. And so in some markets the value of proposition of the telecoms in the device will be different. And so, in a sense really what we\u2019re going to do is go market by market, and configure products that are appropriate for them and we\u2019ve got a platform solution that lets us do that very effectively.", "David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks for your questions David.", "Operator", "Thank you our next question comes from Bruce Du from CBA.", "Bruce Du \u2013 CBA", "Hi guys. Just two questions for me. Just to clarify, so in terms of the timing for SERVE-HF, I think you mentioned the initial results would be in calendar year 2016. Has that time table been pulled back a little bit?", "Michael J. Farrell", "No Bruce. We\u2019ve always say that the final patient the power around the study. It\u2019s an even driven trial so, we don\u2019t know the exact date but the based on the power analysis and the even rate, that we have predicted the formal patient should hit the two year mark from initial setup some time in 2015. Then the primary investigators have to collect the data, analyze the data, create a peer view publication, go through the peer view prices and then get published so that they can present it ACC or HFSA or AHA.", "And so that process will result in a first publication and presentation sometime in calendar year 2016. I\u2019d like to make the point, that there will be multiple publications that come from this study. And this is just the first publication that we think it will be a seminal one. That\u2019ll come out during calendar year 2016.", "Bruce Du \u2013 CBA", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just the second one was around the Astral in the US. Could you perhaps give us a bit of color in terms of the degree of I guess understanding and sophistication by DMEs around the product given it is a relatively new product for you? Does that imply a relatively slower ramp up?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So there will be a slower ramp up of the Astral product in the U.S. market. These of the our European market, because in Europe we played in home life support ventilation for the last seven years. Since our (inaudible) longer than eight years since our acquisition of Saime. In the U.S. market, we are developing our channel with our risk free account managers and interfaces between them in our territory mangers in through our U.S. channel. I can tell you, we\u2019ve been ramping up that team over the last 6 to 12 months.", "We trained them very well at the America\u2019s sales meeting a couple of months ago and they will be and they will be and are talking to customers on a day-to-day basis already in the market. The customers have used a similar product from competing companies and so there are number of HME providers who are well versed in using home life support ventilation.", "So the customer education is not the issue and the customer is actually would like other supplies based on our initial conversations and we think that the value we provide with the lower total cost of ownership, increased freedom for patients, increased ease-of-use and increased maintenance and capability of these devices for both the patient and the provider that there\u2019s a very good value proposition.", "But if you like, there will be a faster ramp-up of the S-curve of penetration in western Europe versus for the United States. Use of the Americas. In Canada and Latin America, the ramp will be faster more home ventilation supported markets there where we\u2019ve been selling products already from our existing portfolio there.", "David Clair \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Market.", "Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrew Hanover in for Joanne Wuensch. I had two questions for Brett, but I wanted to start off with the first more strategic one for Mick just as a follow-up to the last question as it relates to the sales force for Astral. And you know do you believe that you have the right size sales force right now, or are you expecting to increase or decrease it?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So I\u2019ll take the first take the first half of that question, Andrew, and then I\u2019ll hand the second half of it to Jim to talk about the readiness. Our sales teams globally are very ready for Astro and particularly in France, Germany, and the UK all of the Nordics in many countries in Asia, including Japan, are not limited to it.", "The teams are very well versed in life support ventilation and home ventilation, and we have an existing number one or number two market share in home ventilation in most of western Europe. So I believe the skids are greased for those country markets. Similarly for Canada and Brazil within the Americas. Within the United States, we are ramping up that team as I discussed. Jim, do you want to add any further detail to that ramp-up to answer Andrew\u2019s question.", "James Hollingshead", "Yes, sure. We\u2019re not starting from scratch just right now. The team has been in place for a while, and we are adding incrementally to it. I think we have the right level of coverage, and I think we\u2019re fine.", "Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Great. And for Brett, just two quick ones. How much was FX \u2013 how much did FX help or hurt EPS this quarter?", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Actually, Andrew, it was pretty much flat. No actual impact year on year this quarter.", "Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Great. And then as it relates to flow generators, flow generators were up 12% quarter in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year, they were up 1%. I was just trying to understand how we think about demand for the remainder of the year, and thanks for taking our questions.", "Michael J. Farrell", "The demand for the rest of the year?", "Andrew Hanover \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Trend for the rest of the year, just so we get a good understanding.", "Brett A. Sandercock", "Well, the trends on that on the flow gens are probably \u2013 probably like Mick talk about it, it is not something we give out in any sort of detailed guidance or anything.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Now, Brett, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going to go into detailed guidance on that. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs.", "Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, about Asia. You mentioned you\u2019d in-sourced a number of distribution channels, including in Australia. Just wondering sort of outside Americas, how much do you now distribute directly, and how much is through distributors and where do you see the split moving?", "Michael J. Farrell", "Yes, Ian, we have different models in all the different countries we are in, and we adjust it based upon the needs within those countries. So we sell or distribute within 100 countries, and there are very different models in all of them.", "For the vast majority of our revenues, we partner with home care providers and HME providers such as in the U.S. and France and in markets where there aren\u2019t government reimbursement. In others we have different models that apply.", "Our goal in all this from a strategic perspective is to think about the best needs for the health care system and the best needs for the patient and the best needs for everyone in the value chain. And what we\u2019re finding is that the solutions that we can bring to the market have applicability in each of those different country areas.", "And so I think Rob described it really well earlier that we customize our value prop from a platform that\u2019s flexible country by country, region by region, and frankly even within country reimbursement group by reimbursement group.", "Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great. And then if I could perhaps ask about the AirSense 10. Do you have sort of any \u2013 I know you\u2019re one step removed, but do you have any sense if it\u2019s driving any upgrades? Are you seeing existing patients actually coming in and asking for the new model, or is it mainly still new patients?", "Michael J. Farrell", "So, Ian, we don\u2019t have knowledge to that level of granularity to know at the patient level who is getting the new device set up. Certainly within our U.S. environment, the HME providers that have started to order and use the AirSense 10 have been very pleased and delighted with the product. Its ease of setup. It\u2019s small. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s all integrated. There\u2019s no SKUs to manage, so we\u2019re seeing great benefit from that.", "On the patient side, there are a lot of patient benefits about being small and quiet and comfortable and having the ability to seamlessly have their data shared with their doctor so that they don\u2019t have to drive in for doctor visits. I think a particular aspect of patient engagement that\u2019s important is a product that may not have hit much on your radar, but it\u2019s called myAir.", "It\u2019s a patient engagement solution that allows patients to directly interact with their data. We have a system called HALO, which is an acronym that stands for Hour After Last Off. So when the patient takes off the mask, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s 6:30 AM, by 7:30 AM their data is available in the cloud and then the HME provider, or the doctor, when they turn up at their office, can have those data in virtually real-time.", "Similarly, if the HME provider and the patient think it makes sense, the patient can go on their own app on myAir and see their own data. And there can be coaching, there can be feedback, and taking away non-reimbursed costs for the HME provider and potentially improving outcomes and certainly reducing costs for the channel within that system.", "So we think there are so many advantages of the Air Solutions platform for patients that it will be very engaging. But given we are only two months in, it\u2019s hard to really piece out what is channel demand from HME providers, channel demand from physicians who like features such as the AutoSet for Her, which is an algorithm specifically designed for women or features that, as you indicated, our patients may like myAir.", "Ian Abbott \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Ian.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA.", "David Stanton \u2013 CLSA", "Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. I wonder if you could give us some more color in terms of the numbers around whether the use of the AirSense 10 versus other products leads to a lower setup in maintenance costs for a U.S. DME and a patient. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, we have some data that we presented at the American Thoracic Society conference in May this year, and it\u2019s related to the AirSense 10\u2019s automated informatics capability. And it was a presentation about a technology called U-Sleep, which an HME provider can use, and it provides information via email, text or even interactive voice response. So direct voice to patients that coaches them through the sort of 3-, 7-, 14-, 30-day process and beyond to 365 days and beyond them.", "And those data from that presentation showed that the costs for an HME can be reduced by up to 59%. That\u2019s 59%. And the adherence had a trend to improvement that went from 73% adherence to 83% adherence. And that may not sound like a whole lot, but 10 percentage points improvement of adherence for a payer system that\u2019s managing a portfolio of patients or an HME provider that\u2019s looking at costs in a tough P&L environment for them could be quite a material contributor to the savings of both those groups.", "And more importantly for the patients themselves, it means they\u2019re going to stick to this therapy, which is going to help them improve their long-term outcomes. So we think in terms of color for the AirSense 10 that the improvements are quantifiable, and our customers will start to see them and quantify them in their own way with their own systems as it rolls out over the coming quarters and months and years.", "David Stanton \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And I wonder if you\u2019d make a comment in terms of period end discounting, how you characterize the market in recent periods compared to perhaps a year or so ago? Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell", "David, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll hand that one to Jim, and I think it\u2019s the end of our Q&A after that.", "James Hollingshead", "Yeah. David, I would say we haven\u2019t seen anything unusual this quarter, and I think for a long time our sales have been \u2013 in the quarter have been sort of backend weighted. But we didn\u2019t see anything substantially different this quarter as we have over the past several periods.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks for your questions, David.", "David Stanton \u2013 CLSA", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark, so I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell", "Thanks, Larissa. I\u2019d like to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed teams from around the world for their contribution to our recent product launches. Your innovative engineering solutions are changing the game for customers in over 100 countries, helping them improve patient quality of life, helping them reduce the cost burden of chronic disease and helping them improve the delivery of respiratory health care. We remain focused on changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. Thank you and we\u2019ll talk to you again in 90 days.", "Agnes Lee", "So this concludes our first quarter earnings live webcast.

My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Adrienne. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Agnes and thank you to our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our Q3 fiscal year 2015 results. I'm pleased to report that we continued to make excellent progress from new product launches in our core sleep disorder breathing market. We also saw solid progress in our cardiology and respiratory care markets during the quarter.", "In these opening remarks, I'll discuss our high-level top and bottom line results, our progress in healthcare informatics and the early trajectory of our latest product and solution launches globally. Finally, I'll cover progress against our longer-term three horizons growth strategy. Then I'll turn the call over to Brett in Sydney, our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.", "As you saw in our press release, our global business achieved double-digit revenue growth of 13% on a constant currency basis during the quarter. Including currency headwinds, our global growth was 6% on a year-on-year basis in U.S. dollars.", "We saw strength in our Americas group, with continued double-digit growth in the region, driven by robust sales growth in flow generators as well as high-single-digit constant currency growth in our combined European and Asia-Pacific region. These results were fueled by the success of new product launches in sleep apnea and respiratory care markets, including both COPD and neuromuscular disease states.", "Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.64 on a GAAP basis. In the Americas, we had strong performance in Q3 sales, with the commercial team there driving 16% year-on-year growth. We're particularly pleased with flow generator growth in the region which was over 40%. This exceptional result was driven by the ongoing successful rollout of our Astral, our AirSense 10 and our AirCurve 10 platforms.", "Customers continue to see the value proposition of our healthcare informatics platform that we have branded Air Solutions. This platform continues to drive our flow generator success. The strong flow generator sales were partially offset by lower mask sales.", "On that front, we're still facing annualization of price adjustments that we made from January through to June in 2014. In addition, we're facing a tough competitive environment in the mask category. However, we're confident that we will return to positive growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward.", "Moving on to our combined European and Asia-Pacific region, we grew at a very solid 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. After we account for the strong currency headwinds, particularly from the declining euro and the strong U.S. dollar, headline growth declined by 6% for the combined Europe and Asia-Pacific region. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators in Europe associated with our new product launches as well as steady growth in masks in the region.", "With the latest launch of our AirCurve 10 bilevel flow generator platform in Europe, we continue to add to the broad suite of launches with solid multiyear product life cycles.", "There continues to be strong interest in respiratory care and cardiorespiratory opportunities across the European region. We have seen good adoption of our Astral platform in Europe and we're excited about future opportunities as we combine Astral with our healthcare informatics solutions.", "We continued to work with our European and Asia-Pac teams to develop treatment pathways that facilitate standard-of-care protocols, including both pulmonary and cardiology physician groups in both hospital and home care environments. As an important component of our SERVE-HF clinical trial, we're investing in cardiology awareness, cardiology screening and cardiology diagnostic referral infrastructure to the pulmonary folks in the European region and beyond. I will discuss SERVE HF in more detail later on in these remarks.", "In Asia-Pac, we're continuing to execute on our strategies for longer-term growth while working across a variety of mask and market delivery channels. In addition, we had strong double-digit growth in key emerging market countries, particularly China, as we continue to build for the future in those markets.", "Let me spend a few moments reviewing some of the background behind our progress in informatics. As outlined earlier, we call our healthcare informatics ecosystem Air Solutions. Air Solutions is providing significant quantifiable value to our customers, leading to discretionary share gains in flow generators sales.", "More importantly, Air Solutions use liberating data to help patients, physicians, providers, government and private payers and other partners in the healthcare delivery channel. We're seeing the results of our innovation, even though it is just over seven months since the launch of our first AirSense 10 product. Customers have recognized the value of Air Solutions, an end-to-end system that can help them one, lower costs; two, drive efficiencies; three, increase patient adherence; and four, improve patient care.", "During the quarter, we further enhanced the Air Solutions ecosystem through the integration of our AirView software with leading healthcare informatics partners. We also announced the acquisition of Jaysec. Jaysec is a provider of Internet-based software solutions for our home medical equipment customers. This acquisition allows us to deliver automated, streamlined business solutions, such as mask and accessory resupply systems, that are both cost effective and drive efficiencies for our HME partners. We're offering all Jaysec products to all customers.", "We see many opportunities to enhance and expand our informatics solution as the broader healthcare industry continues to move towards connected care models. We will use our newest core competence in healthcare informatics to drive channel efficiencies, to unlock cost savings and most importantly, to improve patient outcomes.", "Let me drill into the detail of our new product launches just a little. We launched the AirCurve 10 in the U.S. in December. And although it is still early days, we had good uptake and excellent customer feedback in this, our first full quarter of sales.", "We also launched the AirCurve 10 in Europe during Q3. This included an important new device, the AirCurve CS PaceWave. PaceWave is our brand name for our proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation therapy.", "The acronym for this algorithm is MVASV. But I think that PaceWave is easier to remember. Our PaceWave algorithm is unique and highly protected with patents and other intellectual property. As part of the AirCurve 10 launch, we added Air Solutions, our cloud-based software solutions technology, to our bilevel, our noninvasive ventilation and our adaptive servo-ventilation platforms. The combination of the AirCurve 10 CS PaceWave with our Air Solutions platform is particularly powerful, given the hospitalization rates and the severity of disease for patients who suffer from heart failure and concomitant sleep apnea.", "For our mask and accessories category, the market remains stable, but competitive. As I stated earlier, we're confident that we will return to solid growth in the mask and accessory category as we move forward.", "Now I would like to take a broader longer-term view and spend some time talking about progress against our global three horizons growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea market, we have continued to drive healthcare informatics solutions that meet our customers' needs for efficiency, patient adherence and improved outcomes.", "Our recent acquisition of Jaysec and completing our integration with leading informatics partners are good milestones in that journey. We're taking advantage of future opportunities to grow even more connected care solutions with customers through the AirCurve 10 launch.", "Reimbursement remains relatively stable across our geographies, including the U.S. Last week, our U.S. customers welcomed positive news as Obama signed the doc fix bill which added anti-fraud provisions to competitive bidding. This change requires binding bids and proof that a DME or HME is licensed in the state that it is providing products to customers.", "Although this legislation does not impact current bidding rounds, it will have a positive impact on future recompete rounds. The bottom line is that this should improve the quality of bidders to ensure that they deliver good service to patients and it should improve the stability of the channel. On the legal front, we won an injunction against a Chinese-based competitor in Germany during February. The Munich District Court upheld its injunction that prohibits the sale or distribution of that company's masks that infringe our patents.", "At ResMed, we're committed to protecting our world-leading respiratory medical innovation and we will defend our more than 5000 patents and designs so that we can continue to innovate and continue to change millions of lives as we move forward. We will continue to take action to enforce our intellectual property and to defend our significant investment in research and development.", "Our global R&D investment is holding strong, at approximately 7% of our revenues, with a focus on pioneering clinical research, world-leading biomedical engineering and cutting-edge healthcare informatics.", "Moving on to our second horizon of growth, we're making solid progress on two fronts, our respiratory care market as well as our emerging markets growth. The European respiratory care business is growing from the strong base that we have developed over the last decade and more. In the U.S., we continue to build our respiratory care channels and our strength in those channels. There is a very long runway ahead for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients to be helped by our Astral life-support ventilator and our other offerings.", "The Astral platform allows patient care to take place in the home rather than in the hospital, providing better quality of life for patients, including caregivers and loved ones and simultaneously taking costs out of strained healthcare systems.", "On the geographic expansion component of horizon two, we continue to make progress in our emerging markets, with solid double-digit growth this quarter. We've increased our investment in these markets and are executing on our long term strategies in China, India, Brazil, as well as Eastern Europe., where there are great opportunities to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs across these emerging markets.", "Our third horizon of growth focuses on cardiorespiratory conditions, with an emphasis on central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration, particularly in heart failure patients. There is growing momentum in the heart failure and sleep apnea space and we continue to facilitate strong partnerships between cardiologists and critical care and pulmonary physicians.", "There have been a number of new studies this quarter that continue to build a connection between heart failure and SDB, including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. At the American College of Cardiology, or ACC, meeting here in San Diego, we sponsored two posters on sleep disordered breathing in patients with chronic heart failure. One of the posters with final data from nearly 7000 patients in Germany showed that 46% of patients with stable chronic heart failure had moderate to severe SDB, AHI north of 15. That's almost every second patient that walks in the cardiologists' door.", "The second poster from Thomas Jefferson University suggested that treating SDB in chronic heart failure patients may reduce hospital admission and hospital readmission rates. In addition, Ohio State University research has published a study in January showing that patients with untreated sleep apnea have worse prognosis for mortality after they have been discharged from the hospital for acute heart failure.", "The data suggests that those that had their sleep apnea treated with PAP therapy improved survival rates, approximately to rates that were similar to patients who had heart failure with minimal or no sleep apnea. This study supports the work that we're doing on our SERVE-HF and our CAT-HF clinical trials. Focusing now on those trials. Our SERVE-HF trial in Europe and Australia is going well. In fact, data collection has been occurring at a faster pace during these last three months.", "As a result, we're now expecting presentation of the SERVE-HF data by the primary investigators to occur before the end of calendar year 2015. This is slightly ahead of the timeline that we discussed on our Q2 call.", "For our CAT-HF clinical trial in the U.S., we still expect that the CAT-HF results will be available during calendar year 2017. As a reminder, SERVE-HF is powered to show changes in mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with CSA, while CAT-HF is powered show improvements in global cardiovascular outcomes. Both trials lead to a potential change in guiding principles and standard-of-care for heart failure patients.", "It is important to note that both studies use ResMed's proprietary minute ventilation-targeted adaptive servo-ventilation technology which the acronym again is MVASV, that we have branded PaceWave. We will continue to provide updates as significant milestones are reached in both of these important and pioneering clinical trials. We remain active on the capital management front, including share buybacks and dividends. You will hear more about these actions in Q3 from Brett in a couple of minutes.", "Additionally, we continue to look at M&A opportunities that are aligned with our long term three horizon growth strategy and assets that we can leverage, manage better than the current owners and enhance long term shareholder value.", "Let me close with this. We're excited about our long term outlook and our three horizons growth strategy. We're progressing on our journey to change 20 million lives by 2020 in both sleep and broader respiratory medicine. We're executing well to that plan.", "With that, I will turn the care over to Brett in Sydney for a more detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Great. Thank you, Mick. As Mick has noted, our revenue for the March quarter was $422.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $28.5 million in the third quarter.", "At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $250.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.6 million, a decrease of 6% over the prior-year quarter. But in constant currency terms, sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segment, Americas' flow generators sales were $133.1 million, an increase of 42% over the prior-year quarter. While masks and other sales were $117.8 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior-year quarter.", "For revenue in Europe and Asia-Pacific, flow generator sales were $115.9 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. And in constant currency terms, an increase of 13%. Masks and other sales were $55.7 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 26%, while masks and other decreased by 1% over the prior-year quarter.", "Gross margins for the March quarter were 59.5%, lower than guidance essentially due to larger-than-expected depreciation of the euro during the quarter and outperformance on Americas flow generator growth. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 380 basis points, reflecting declines in average selling prices, unfavorable product mix, unfavorable geographic mix and adverse currency movements.", "Looking forward in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we expect gross margin to be broadly consistent with Q3, being in the range of 59% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. Gross margin drivers, like currency fluctuations and geographic and product mix could swing this range further if they move beyond their expectations.", "We do expect to see some traction in late Q4 from our cost-out programs for the AirSense platform and should see ongoing benefits from our cost-out programs, including procurement, production and logistics improvements reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin.", "Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $116.3 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%, primarily due to higher variable employee compensation, the impact of recent acquisitions and the release of contingent consideration in the prior-year quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27.5% compared to the year-ago figure of 28.9%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. R&D expenses for the quarter were $27 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter. But on a constant currency basis, an increase of 4%. This increase largely reflects incremental investment in the areas of healthcare informatics and cardiology. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.4%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, informatics solutions and clinical trials, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar, in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.2 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%. We estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2015 will be in the range of 20% to 21%.", "Net income for the quarter was $91 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third-quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, partially offset by the weaker Australian dollar.", "Cash flow from operations was $90.9 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $10.6 million, while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $17.9 million. We've continued to be active on the capital management front and our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share. And during the quarter, we repurchased 300,000 shares for consideration of $20.3 million.", "For the first nine months of fiscal year 2015, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares for consideration of $96.7 million. At the end of March, we had approximately 16.5 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. To-date in fiscal year 2015, we have returned 92% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And over the last five years, we have returned 98% free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases.", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balances at the end of the quarter were $406 million. And at March 31, total assets were $2.3 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion.", "And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Adrienne, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Goodsall", "I was just going to perhaps focus on masks. Just trying to sort of understand when we might expect -- or what internally you're seeing yourself doing when we might expect, I guess, that to sort of show up in the numbers in terms of recovery against, perhaps, when you moved your prices last year. And perhaps just a comment on the percentage conversion you might be seeing of your flow generators in the mask conversion -- why that's up perhaps a little higher?", "Mick Farrell", "That question allows us to talk a little bit about the mask side. And we're expecting to return to positive growth, not just in the Americas, but globally, to continue good trends we have outside the Americas. The mask category continues to be competitive Andrew, but stable. We'll be annualizing those price declines that we made a year ago, January through June of 2014, through January through June 2015. So we're over the halfway point, but there is still some sort of time to -- as we went customer by customer, region by region, for those to annualize.", "So as we look forward, we will get back to positive growth. And we have a strong mask portfolio and a good pipeline to follow beyond that.", "Andrew Goodsall", "And is it reasonable to sort of expect that you're achieving some level of, I guess, conversion along with the flow generator with your bundling or looking to sell the solution as a combined solution?", "Mick Farrell", "Andrew, there is some halo effect, certainly when you walk in with the value proposition of the AirSense 10 and the Air Solutions. And as you saw, stellar growth of 42% year-on-year in the Americas there. You've obviously got a sales force with a lot of interest from their customers. And it allows conversations to start, obviously, about other parts of the business, like ventilation, like respiratory care and like masks.", "So I do think there are some halo effects that come from that. But I think some of the more important factors are the fact that we're annualizing the January to June price adjustments. The market is competitive and our team is getting back on the front foot in that category while winning very strongly in some other categories.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Couple ones from me. Can you maybe comment on U.S. generator growth which clearly accelerated this quarter. How sustainable is that? And are you seeing a similar growth rate that you saw in AirSense 10 last quarter or is that also accelerating?", "Mick Farrell", "Margaret, I'll take the first part of that question and I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, for the second one. Clearly, with a number like that that we probably haven't seen since 2006, 2007 of 42% growth for the quarter year-on-year in flow generators in the Americas, you're not just growing with the market. You're clearly taking some share.", "So to the extent that there is market share taking, that can happen for a period of time and then that period of time ends. But we do think that there's strong growth in the core U.S. market and, frankly, in our core global markets in the sleep disorder breathing space. And we expect that to continue, because we're vastly underpenetrated in developed markets as well as our developing and emerging markets.", "Jim, would you like to add any more color that?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Sure, Mick. Thanks. And thanks for the question, Margaret. We think that the flow gen growth represents not just the fact that the AirSense 10 platform and the AirCurve 10 platform are really strong products in their own right as flow gens and bilevels, but also the recognition on the part of our customers of the value of the all-in solution that we're offering.", "So both of those platforms have onboard communications, but it goes beyond just having an onboard modem. It allows our customers to drive efficiencies into their businesses through the use of our solution software platform. So the number of features related to our software that are driving efficiencies in our customers' business and we think we have a very clear advantage with the overall offer in the market right now that customers are taking advantage of.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Okay. So you guys are seeing kind of similar or maybe accelerating growth in AirSense as kind of the way that I read maybe that answer. And then Brett, can you walk us through the gross margins this quarter? You guys broadly talked about FX. Which currencies are most important? And then just to make sure, the price declines that you guys cited in the press release are really year over year versus sequential.", "Brett Sandercock", "On the gross margin, it's all the margin drivers, essentially, but I think it's happened for long time is really mostly sort of headwinds for us this time around. So we had, obviously, year-on-year your currency impact was negative for us.", "That's really being driven by the euro which has declined quite significantly, as I think everybody knows. We do get some offset for the Aussie dollar weakening, but to some extent, that's to the lag the quarter before it turns up in margin.", "So I do expect -- well, all things being equal on currency which is probably a big assumption, but I do expect with that Aussie weakness, some of that benefit will flow through into Q4 for us. We haven't seen that in Q3, but we do cop up front, if you like, that euro falls straightaway. So I think that's something that will help us going into Q4. But then you have other -- the product mix and geographic mix and really that's kind of driven by flow gen outperformance in the U.S.. So you've got that geographic impact and that product mix impact. And they've been negative for us as well.", "And really, even on the sort of optimization of production and manufacturing, something that we have a really good track record on, really haven't been able to focus on that just at the moment. We've really been looking to make sure that we meet demand in the marketplace. And obviously take for granted that we absolutely don't compromise on quality either, but what we have had to do is probably just delay a little bit on the cost-out programs. We're obviously getting on to those now and I think we'll see some benefit there.", "There are other things, like we've been running with much higher air freight than we typically would. Again, that's really a consequence of meeting demand, particularly on that flow gen growth number that you saw. So there is just a number of factors. A lot of those are kind of first-class problems to have. And the ones in the cost side though, they are under our control and we'll absolutely get on top of those.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Is there anything that you can quantify in that in terms of the FX impact this quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. If you looked at -- yes, I mean, the year-on-year -- without -- I don't get too granular, but it's quite meaningful, as it's north of 50 basis points negative.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Steve Wheen from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steve Wheen", "Just a follow-up question on the gross margin. Brett, there is a lot of I guess, things that you can do going forward. I was just surprised to see your guidance for the fourth quarter be very much the same as third quarter. So can you tell us what is sort of holding you back on that front?", "Brett Sandercock", "I guess just looking at what we're seeing in terms of product and geographic trends, okay which it probably tend to be negative on that. But offsetting that, I think we'll see some benefit from the weaker Aussie and we will start to see some of our cost-out program gain some traction. So when you look at it, we have some -- going forward, looks like we have some negative drivers, if you like and then there is some positive ones. And there is a question of what the timing is like and how they balance up.", "And when I looked at it, I think in that kind of short term, where we broadly consistent with where we're in Q3, when we look forward and we look at some of the things that are coming through, if you think of the AirCurve on the bilevels, if you think of Astral and as we build that market in the U.S., clearly, those sort of products will be supportive of the margin. I think we'll get some momentum on our cost-out programs; that will be supportive of the margin.", "So you can see some of these shorter-term headwinds, I think, will certainly abate. And then some of them, I think, will turn positive for us. Yes, if you look forward, I think optimistic on the margin, but at the moment, we're dealing with quite a few headwinds. But notwithstanding those, I think the margin is in pretty good shape.", "Steve Wheen", "And could you just sort of provide some comment on some of the rest-of-world markets, maybe France, Germany and Japan? Perhaps most interest in Japan as to -- that's obviously been quite historically lumpy. What your experience was in the latest quarter for that region?", "Mick Farrell", "Steve, that's great question. I'll hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to talk through those.", "Rob Douglas", "Thanks, Steve. So Japan, yes, is historically lumpy. It had a pretty good quarter this quarter with the products getting good take up going well. We continue to have excellent relationships with our customers and we stay in close touch. And the market there is very stable and moving along well, but will continue to be lumpy through the ordering patterns.", "Europe had a pretty good quarter as well. France performed well. There is still the debate going on in France over the telemonitoring, where for a while the rules were very supportive of telemonitoring and many, many telemonitored units were in the market there. But at the moment, it's still in a sort of a government legal case while they decide what their future policy is going to be, but the market there is again, stable and moving along well. And Germany is also moving well, both our home care business has been winning business and also our wholesale business there is working well. So Germany is moving well.", "Call out a highlight -- the UK has been very strong and some of our market development programs there are really gaining traction. And the basic fundamentals of the benefit of treating sleep apnea is so well understood in the healthcare system there that we're seeing good progress.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Chris Kallos from Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "Chris Kallos", "Brett, just to clarify, the adverse product mix in the U.S., you are suggesting that the success of the flow generators being a low-margin product has impacted the margin. Is that clear -- is that what you're saying?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, that's correct.", "Chris Kallos", "And just the other question I had was just can we get an update on Astral? How that's tracking?", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure, Chris. We'll take a broader view on that. Astral has had a good two or three quarters of runway in our European markets. And in those markets, Chris, we have more than a decade of established partnerships on the pulmonary critical care discharge from the hospital to home care environment. So Astral is seeing very good success and as Rob just sort of went into detail a little bit around France, Germany, UK and beyond in Western Europe.", "In the U.S. market, we launched it later. We launched it sort of in the August-September time frame. And in the U.S. market particularly, we're still developing the respiratory care channel and our strength and capability to sell into that. Having said that, we have many thousands of customers in the U.S. and all of them are now aware that ResMed has a life support ventilator, that it's called Astral and that it has some great benefits, such as giving freedom back to patients or the battery that can extend up to 24 hours away from home. So giving freedom back to their patients.", "So we think there are some great sort of unique selling propositions around it which will give us over the coming fiscal quarters and fiscal years, frankly, an opportunity to grow that business in that geography. So we're excited about Astral as a long term sustainable opportunity for us to drive high-margin flow generator growth.", "Operator", "Next your question comes from Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Sean Laaman", "Guys, I'm wondering if you can just talk about the pricing strategy on U.S. devices, particularly compared to the prior corresponding period. Thanks.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Sean, we haven't made any dramatic changes to our pricing strategy. The biggest thing we're seeing in pricing in the U.S., as we've discussed on the call, is the grandfathering in of some changes we made to our pricing approach last year at this time. So we're still working through some of the pricing changes we made during Q3 and Q4 of last year and that's grandfathering through. But other than that, we haven't made any dramatic changes to pricing.", "Sean Laaman", "And just one follow-up. Were there any sort of lumpy contracts in the U.S. device business sort of won or lost during the quarter compared to the prior corresponding period? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "But we don't go into details on a customer basis. It just doesn't make sense to go into that level of detail for competitive reasons on a public conference call like this. Thanks for the question, but we really can't answer that.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead.", "Mike Matson", "I guess I just wanted to go back to the gross margin. I know you mentioned the various factors that affected it, but I was just wondering -- if one, if you could quantify those. I know some of my other companies will talk about specific basis point impacts for currency, pricing, etcetera.", "And if you can't get into that level of detail, can you at least kind of prioritize them and tell us which ones -- what had the greatest, the least impact on the gross margin?", "Brett Sandercock", "Mike, we don't get quite as granular as that, but on those ones that I've mentioned, they all had -- if you looked at it year-on-year, they all had meaningful impact on the gross margin. Clearly, a mention on the FX impact which was quite large and then product and geographic mix had a quite large impact as well. And then [indiscernible] declines year-on-year also that we've been discussing. All of them were kind of meaningful contributors to that gross margin decline.", "Mike Matson", "Okay. But would you say pricing -- I mean, I think investors are going to be concerned about pricing. And given these other factors, just wondering if you could -- was the pricing kind of equivalent to these other things? Was it more; was it less than the other factors taken individually?", "Brett Sandercock", "They are all meaningful and not -- there wasn't any particular one that overwhelmed the rest, let me put it that way, that were kind of all there in the mix which is really unusual for us to have almost all of them as a headwind. So it's not like any of them were completely driving it, but when you take them as a sum total, then that adds up to quite a large contraction that we saw.", "Mike Matson", "Okay. And then just on the SERVE-HF clinical data. So when that comes out, assuming data is strong and positive, how do we think about -- think through the impact of that on your business, on your flow generators? I guess it would ultimately translate into sales of the -- I can't think of the name it of now -- but the SV product. MSV or whatever it's called product.", "And what's the timing of that? Do you expect that to kind of pick up immediately? Pick up just in Europe first? Do you have to get some additional indications approved through the FDA in the U.S. before you can really market it for the heart failure patient population, etcetera?", "Mick Farrell", "SERVE-HF is a multiyear journey for us going back a number of years. And we expect that sort of first publication of the trial results before the end of the calendar year. You know, that's almost the starting gun that would go off on a long journey, Mike. And there are multiple outcomes in a trial like this. There is the outcome that could improve cardiovascular outcomes. There's an outcome that could improve bigger things, like morbidity or mortality in intention and trade versus per protocol analyses.", "And so many analyses that the primary investigators will have to do from when they crack the code all the way through to when they present the results and then later publish them in a peer reviewed published journal. So there's a long lead time.", "To your point, it will benefit the business. Mike, I find the easier brand to remember is PaceWave. So the PaceWave product will be picking up from that. And studies both used PaceWave SERVE-HF and the CAT-HF. So we're excited to have that sort of proprietary technology included in the trial. But it's a long journey from there. And so you won't see an immediate inflection point the day of presentation at whichever cardiology conference it may be. What you'll see is the starting gun go off on a marathon opportunity for us which goes over multiple quarters and multiple years.", "And really, a lot of it comes down to changing standard-of-care country by country, hospital by hospital, payer by payer and, frankly, cardiology and pulmonary group by cardiology and pulmonary group and getting them to partner across hospitals and we see it as a great long term opportunity for us.", "Mike Matson", "Okay. And just in the U.S., is there anything from a regulatory standpoint you're going to need to do once that data is out? Or can you just go ahead and begin to target the U.S. heart failure market as well?", "Mick Farrell", "Well, in the U.S., our indication for use to treat central sleep apnea, periodic breathing and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. So we'll be focusing on that in the U.S. In other markets in different parts of the world, there will be different approaches of working with cardiology groups. But in the U.S., it will be focused on what we do in treating these very severe types of sleep disorder breathing amongst chronic disease patients.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Stanton from CLSA. Please go ahead.", "David Stanton", "I wonder if you could give us an update on your views in terms of overall market growth rates in the U.S. and Europe? Where do think that's accelerating from the 4% to 6% that you previously talked about, given the strong growth that we've seen in this quarter and previous quarters as well. That's my first question. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "David, look, it's really hard being the only public company that sort of talks on a 90-day cycle here about growth rates to get details of the market growth rates. We talk about it in the mid-single digits in the U.S. and Western Europe. I think there certainly are regions and countries where you're getting double-digit growth, mostly in the emerging markets. We talked earlier about China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe, where we're really partnering with our channel and focusing on growth in those areas.", "And then you get some opportunities, like we have with Air Solutions and what it has driven in great value to customers. And you get some share gains as part of that as well.", "Has market growth tipped up a little because we're moving to connected care models and we're partnering with integrated delivery networks and accountable care organizations? I would say it's a little early for that traction to have started to really move the market in growth. I think that's more of a longer-term story, as you look out sort of one year, three years, five years, where you'll start to see us be able to influence market growth by the great solutions we're providing to take patients out of hospitals, put them in homes and save money for broken healthcare systems.", "So I think we're still sort of looking in that mid-single-digit range. But again, it's blurry and there's a lot of multiple data sources to get to that.", "David Stanton", "And I guess my follow-up to that is as it is getting a little bit closer, can you give us sort of your views on where you see the introduction of the third round of competitive bidding in the U.S. for next year? What that will do, perhaps in your eyes to those market growth rates? Thanks very much.", "Mick Farrell", "So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis, our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel.", "Dave Pendarvis", "CB3, as it's been announced, is pretty much a known quantity now, so that's a good thing. There's stability and predictability in the market for our U.S. customers. They now know that in January of 2016, there begins a phased process that runs through the middle of the year, where reimbursement will be adjusted. There's still some questions about rural adjustments, where there can be a 110% of the national rates.", "But by and large, CB3 should be predictable and therefore, business planning can occur with customers knowing what the reimbursement is they're going to face. And without there being a reduction in the number of authorized customers or authorized suppliers in a region, we don't expect the kind of disruption that we saw in the second round of competitive bidding.", "I'm not sure that that would have a significant impact on growth rates. Obviously, the patients are getting diagnosed and that reimbursement for diagnosis isn't changing. I think our best guess would be that the growth rates would stay roughly the same in those markets that are affected by the third round of competitive bidding.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from William Dunlop from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "William Dunlop", "I just wanted to get a little bit more color around the level of competition you're seeing in masks?", "Mick Farrell", "Sure, William. Masks are multiple categories. You have the full-face masks, you have nasal pillows and then you have nasal masks. And in each of those subcategories, there are multiple players in multiple countries competing with their own innovation.", "What I can tell you is that it is a competitive game. And we're innovating incredibly well and some of our competitors are doing a reasonable job, too. And what that allows is good competition in a market, healthy competition in a market and the opportunity for us and our competitors to present those opportunities to patients, to HME providers and to clinicians and get them excited about what we have.", "So as you go through each of the categories and you go through each of the countries, you win in some categories and in some countries and then you don't win for a while in some categories and countries. But over the long term, what we've showed at ResMed that of the 7% of our revenues that we invest in research and development, we put a good chunk of that into world-leading mask and patient interface, more generally and accessory research.", "And we have, I would say, across countries and across the categories some world-leading innovation that's doing very well and more in the pipeline. As I said, we're going to get back to positive growth in our major geographies and around the world on that. And we're confident about that.", "William Dunlop", "And just following on from that, last quarter, you mentioned that you think you probably took market share sequentially in masks. Would you be able to comment on what you think market share did in this quarter? And just finally, are you able to elaborate more on the pipeline that you just mentioned?", "Mick Farrell", "I'll take the second part first. And the answer to that is no. We're not going to go into details on the pipeline. And I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim to talk about relative share that you might've seen, particularly in the U.S. geography.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yes, I mean, it's a typical member to get to, market share, because there's not terrific data. But based upon what we see in the market, we think the shares are relatively stable and probably we took a little bit of share on the margin in the quarter, but it's very, very difficult to estimate. So if you went with stable shares, you probably wouldn't be far off.", "William Dunlop", "So that implies that the mask market in the U.S. is perhaps going backwards, if you took a little bit of share in the quarter?", "Mick Farrell", "Well you know, you got the difference between unit share and then you've got revenue share. And you've got pricing and many factors into that, William. So one of the things that we've said on these calls is we're not going to go into details of year-on-year price deltas. And so if we start to talk about volumes and exactly where that's at, then everyone can reverse engineer the pricing, including competitors or others who may be reading the transcript or listening to this call. William, I appreciate where you're going in the drill down, but I think we're going to have to go to the next question.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from David Low from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David Low", "Brett, if I could just start with a quick one on other income line. I was wondering if you could talk what's in that? Is it largely FX hedge gain?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, the majority of that is some FX hedge gains and that was largely around our other euro hedging structures, yes.", "David Low", "And just the only other one I had was with the very strong sales growth you saw in the U.S. devices. Just wondering if you are on backorder or whether you've been able to fully supply those orders?", "Mick Farrell", "No, David, we're off backorder in the U.S.. Flow generators and that's a really good thing. The downside of that, as Brett said is that we're doing a lot more air freight than we would like at this time. And so as we start to -- and Brett and Don and the team in Sydney are really getting the factory there, both there and in Singapore, moving.", "So we will expect to start to move from air freight to sea freight. And as Brett said earlier, to start those cost-out programs over the coming quarters to get us back on track there. But no, we were not on backorder this quarter which is a good thing.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Anthony Petrone", "Maybe to focus in on U.S. flow gens as well. Just trying to get a sense of AirCurve in the quarter or were there any large stocking orders on the bilevels in the quarter? I know it was launched late last quarter, so was just wondering the extent of the impact in this quarter? And then a follow-up.", "Mick Farrell", "Jim, do you want to take the question about the orders? Do you know how it impacted inventory-wise or replacements?", "Jim Hollingshead", "It's not something we have perfect visibility into, but I didn't see anything unusual in the quarter in terms of stocking orders. The year got off to a really good start since its launch and so it's on a really good growth and adoption ramp. And we think we're taking share in that category as well as in APAP and CPAP. But we didn't see anything unusual.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, I think what you saw last quarter was a good ramp up of the AirSense 10. And what you saw this quarter was a good ramp up of the AirCurve 10 combined with ongoing ramp up of the AirSense 10. You have the addition of Astral, mainly in Europe, but starting to happen in the U.S. geography, Anthony.", "Anthony Petrone", "And then the second one is on CHF. And just trying to get a sense of how this plays out potentially into 2016, specifically from an operational standpoint. So I would imagine some of the R&D expenses will fall off when SERVE-HF is done. So is that the case? And will that be completely offset by reinvestments into the marketing efforts for SERVE-HF or is that a net benefit?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, good question about SERVE-HF. And as we start to complete that study, what you should realize is usually when these studies go out, there are a number of follow-on publications that look to analyze the data that we've collected over these 5 years to 7 years from different angles to produce different things. And so I would expect ongoing analysis and research, certainly on the buyer statistician side and analysis of the data from investigators and workers on the study.", "Yes, but certainly the day-to-day recruitment of patients does slow down as you move off those studies. But one thing about ResMed, Anthony, is that we take a long term view and we invest for the long term. And so the growing needs and opportunities for us in healthcare informatics, for instance, are an area that we're investing in and we'll continue to ramp up our investment.", "The growing opportunities to develop channels and research around COPD and the mortality rate that you saw in the current line study that we talked about two quarters ago, where you have a 76% relative reduction in mortality for COPD patients treated with noninvasive ventilation.", "I mean, there are so many opportunities for research in the COPD side that I wouldn't -- if I was running your model for FY '16, I wouldn't be pulling out R&D dollars for ResMed. I would say ResMed is going to reinvest and keep that sort of 5 year, 10 year, 15 year view that clinical research drives market development, drives market growth and drives value for patients. And that's something that we focus on for the long term.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Saul Hadassin", "Brett, just a question on operating cash flow. I think I heard you right. You mentioned for the quarter, it was around $91 million or $90.9 million. Just wondering if you could give us what that might have been in constant currency or what the FX impact was? Because that looks like it's down fairly materially on the PCP. And just a follow-up to that question is just what's happening on the receivables side in terms of trading terms? That would be great. Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I'll take the first one on receivables on the sort of -- our days sales and trading terms, they were pretty consistent with where they've been kind of this time last year and over the last few quarters. So I think that's been pretty stable. On the operating cash flow front, yes, it's down on PCP. But around the euro and the decline and so on, that would certainly hurt us a little bit on the cash flow front. But you've got to be a bit cautious, because they are 90 day snapshots on the cash flow.", "I think I prefer to look at it more of a longer-term trend on the cash flow. So PCP was down a little bit. I think overall, the cash flow remains quite strong, although yes, probably hurt a little bit on the FX front.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Craig Collie from Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Craig Collie", "Two for me. The first, just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the very impressive flow gen growth number. Mick, could you perhaps give us a little bit of flavor as to the waitings of some of the separate drivers, in particular share gains from, I guess, new patients being diagnosed with sleep apnea versus the installed base upgrading versus perhaps bilevels and cardiorespiratory cells?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, I mean, to the comments I made earlier, clearly, a number of 42% in the U.S. geography, given the large base we have there, is exceptional. And it's exceptionally good, but it is exceptional and it did include a big chunk of share gain that we would know. To delve out exactly what was market growth versus share gain growth, I'll leave the mathematics of that up to you and the other experts on the call.", "But as I look to the sustainability of the long term underlying growth there, I think it is there in that good solid mid-single-digit market growth that we talked about. The difference between AirSense 10 which is in its third quarter, I guess, of real moving up that S-curve of launch and AirCurve 10 which is just finishing its first full quarter and then you add in Astral which is got, for the U.S. market, a much longer penetration curve to go, you can sort of get into some pretty complex calculations as to exactly what shares they'll be. What we're focused on is really the long term, Craig. We're absolutely taking share in sleep disorder breathing, but more importantly than that, we're switching the industry to focus on healthcare informatics as a value play.", "That taking data to the cloud is not enough. You have to then take that data and provide solutions for your customers, to take cost out of the channel, to get efficiencies. And for patients, physicians and providers to all get real-time data so that they can make their businesses better, make the patients better and improve outcomes and so it's sort of a long term gain versus, for us, let's analyze the 90 days and look at it.", "And I think what the milestone of that 42% says the long term game is the right game and it's got some capability. And we should double down our investment in that space.", "Craig Collie", "And then just lastly, any updates on a potential pilot for bundling?", "Mick Farrell", "So I'll hand that question to Dave Pendarvis to talk about bundling associated with CB for future rounds.", "Dave Pendarvis", "It's really been no news on that front. So you know, the situation remains that there is an initial proposal from CMS, that they suggested they might run a bundling pilot. There are no more details on what that pilot might look like, when, if at all, it would go into effect. And we've just heard nothing else. So really no developments on that front.", "Operator", "Yes, we will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Great. Well, thanks, Adrienne. In closing, I would like to thank the more than 4000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing millions of lives, literally with every breath. We certainly remain inspired by our long term aspiration of changing 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time today. We hope to see many of you at our ResMed Investor Day which we're holding this June 2015 in San Francisco. More details from Agnes on that later.", "Agnes Lee", "Yes. And thank you all for joining us again today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee - Senior Director-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Melissa, and thank you, everyone, for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.

We believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us on today's investor call as we provide an overview of our fiscal Q1 2016 quarterly results.", "We have started the year with very strong sales growth in both our sleep apnea business and our respiratory care business. In my remarks, I'll discuss our top and bottom line results, some regional highlights from our global business, as well as an overview of the progress that we have made against our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that, as usual, I will hand over to Brett to walk you through the financial results in greater detail.", "Once again, this quarter, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency of 15%. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth, and we achieved solid steady growth our combined EMEA and APAC group. These global results were fueled by the success of our new product and solutions launches in both our sleep apnea and our respiratory care businesses.", "Looking at the bottom line, our diluted EPS was $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. EPS was $0.57 on a GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investment growth opportunities whilst carefully managing our growth in R&D and SG&A. We gained operating leverage this quarter, as both R&D as well as SG&A grew at a lower rate than our top line revenue.", "We are on track to further increase operating leverage throughout fiscal year 2016 and we are executing on our plans to improve gross margin, driving further efficiency improvements in both manufacturing and supply chain costs, as I outlined last quarter.", "We have a lot of runway left for ongoing growth of our high margin product businesses, including the AirCurve 10 bilevel platform and our Astral life support ventilation platform. As we look forward over the coming fiscal quarters and the fiscal year, we will further leverage our automated informatics solutions to drive ongoing mask and accessories resupply growth.", "Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had a very strong sales performance in Q1, with our team driving north of 20% growth on a year-on-year basis. Flow generator growth was 39%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and our Astral platforms, as well as our end-to-end Healthcare Informatics solutions. Mask and accessories grew at 9% during the quarter in the Americas. Pricing continues to be stable in the mask categories. We continue to expect positive mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016.", "Moving on to our combined EMEA and APAC group, we grew at 5% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw strong sales growth from flow generators and our mask and accessory businesses in the EMEA and APAC group. Clearly, the SERVE-HF results and our contraindication for ASV in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea patients was a headwind. ASV sales in Europe were more affected than we had predicted. However, it is important to note that ASV sales in APAC and the U.S. were significantly less affected than in Europe.", "We have not seen any impact beyond our ASV sales for patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in predominant central sleep apnea. This is consistent with the conclusions from the New England Journal of Medicine publication and the commentary from key opinion leaders in The Lancet, in CHEST, and in the Blue journal, all stating that the data from the study should not be extrapolated beyond the treatment group. It just makes good sense.", "APAC sales were strong in the quarter and we continue to see robust growth across all of our high growth markets this quarter, including China. We announced earlier this month that we have now completed the acquisition of Curative Medical. This partnership of our ResMed China business and the Curative Medical team provides us with a leading market share position in China and a separate brand with innovative products that are developed and manufactured in China for China. This acquisition will allow us to expand both the sleep apnea and respiratory care markets in China and beyond.", "Now I'd like to talk more about our progress against our ResMed 2020 Three Horizons Growth Strategy. Earlier this month, ResMed was a platinum sponsor for the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, and the meeting was held right here in San Diego.", "AdvaMed is the world's largest med tech association and its conference is the most important in the med tech industry globally. One of the main themes of AdvaMed 2015 was the increasing importance of digital health for medical devices and connected care for patients.", "ResMed has been at the very forefront of healthcare informatics innovation for over a decade. We are leading and driving this trend for our industry. Just over one year after the launch of the Air Solutions Platform and the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10, we have well over 1 million patients with cloud-connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables. As these devices provide daily updates to the cloud, it allows ResMed to provide actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers.", "We have built an industry-leading core competency in healthcare informatics allowing us to provide the best value with market-leading solutions that improve operational efficiency, improve patient adherence and improve long-term outcomes for patients.", "Our customers clearly understand the value proposition of ResMed's Air Solutions. Most of the time, we cannot talk publicly about these results, but one of our customers has allowed us to report on their increased staff efficiency and accelerated business growth after adopting Air Solutions from ResMed. Based on their own data, this customer is saving 80 labor hours per month, reducing the number of unreached patients by more than 85% and increasing the number of new patient setups by 55% on a year-over-year basis. These results are a big part of why so many customers are partnering with ResMed.", "We have many other examples of customer success using our healthcare informatics solutions. U-Sleep is the ResMed-branded cloud-based application that monitors patient adherence and automatically identifies and triages which patients need the most help so that a homecare provider can proactively address issues and provide better care.", "In a previous investor call, I talked about a study presented at the American Thoracic Society in which a U-Sleep customer saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83% along with a 59% decrease in their labor costs. To prove that this was not a one-time, one-customer event, let me provide an overview of a study just published in the Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research. This study showed that by using adherence coaching from U-Sleep, the customer was able to increase compliance from 60% using standard adherence monitoring up to 87% using the automated compliance monitoring capabilities of our U-Sleep solution.", "In addition to this 27% increase in the number of adherent patients on therapy, the customer staff was able to set up 83% more patients at the same labor cost. This is clearly a very significant operating efficiency improvement for our customer. The acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added new capabilities to our end-to-end solution that we call ResMed ReSupply. This capability provides automated resupply solutions for our customers so that they can efficiently manage mask and accessory resupply to patients through automated text, email or interactive voice response, with a multilingual call center backing up the solution live, if necessary.", "We have seen great success with the Air Solutions platform and devices, and we will continue to build our healthcare informatics capabilities so that we can drive channel efficiencies, unlock cost savings, drive appropriate growth in masks and accessories provision to patients, and, ultimately, improve long-term patient outcomes.", "In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we see opportunities to leverage the healthcare informatics strength from our sleep apnea business directly into our adjacent respiratory care businesses. We are already taking AirCurve 10 data to the cloud, and you will hear more from us on this front as we move forward. Watch this space.", "We are expanding our presence in the U.S. respiratory care market and building on our strong presence in Europe for both our life support ventilation solutions, and our non-invasive ventilation solutions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neuromuscular disease.", "Another growth vector under our second horizon of growth is our ongoing investments in high growth market geographies. With the completion of the Curative Medical acquisition, we are now the market share leader in the sleep apnea and respiratory care market in China. We are extremely well-positioned for sustained long-term growth, with two strategically aligned, yet operationally independent teams targeting different, yet fast-growing customer segments within the China market. We continue to invest in high growth markets like China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. In each geography, we provide and drive long-term strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall system healthcare costs within each individual country, proving on that promise with hard data.", "Finally, let's review our third horizon of growth. Let me first spend a few moments talking about SERVE-HF. As you all know, ResMed put patient safety first and foremost. It was the most important priority when we announced the preliminary study results from SERVE back in May, many months before the study was eventually published.", "As we had expected, the SERVE-HF study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine quite recently. The study's primary investigators presented results at the European Society of Cardiology and at the European Respiratory Society conferences. The results of the study, the safety signal, and the contraindication remain unchanged from May.", "It is worth noting that our ASV business in other market segments has been unaffected in these last five months since the SERVE-HF announcement. These other segments include treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, time-management-induced central sleep apnea, and post-traumatic stress disorder-related uses of ASV. These all remain strong market segments in the U.S., and we are working on expanding these applications further through Europe and Asia Pacific.", "Our third horizon of growth includes a number of cardio-respiratory treatment opportunities, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and chronic disease management opportunities in cardiology. These are very exciting longer-term opportunities that we will speak more about later.", "Returning to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. In this quarter, we bought back 1.2 million shares in addition to funding our dividend. Through September 30, our stock repurchase program has returned to shareholders a total of $1.5 billion. It's your cash and we think you should get it back.", "We continue to look for potential acquisitions where three key criteria are met; one, the business is aligned with our long-term strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed's shareholder value; and three, that there is a cultural fit between the acquisition target business and ResMed's team. We hit all of these three criteria solidly with the Curative Medical acquisition, and we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we look forward.", "At ResMed, we are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but, more importantly, in products and informatics solutions innovation, as well as in service, channel, and market innovation. We remain very excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners, and, most importantly, for many, many millions of patients around the world.", "With that, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brett, for a more detailed review of our Q1 financials. Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the September quarter was $411.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter, where in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $26.8 million in the first quarter.", "At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $254.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC group totaled $157.5 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter. However, in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC group increased by 5% over the prior-year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas' flow generator sales were $132.1 million, an increase of 39% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter. For revenue in the combined EMEA and APAC group, flow generator sales were $107.5 million, a decrease of 10% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $50 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior-year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 7%.", "Globally, in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 20% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the September quarter was 58%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 440 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, an unfavorable geographic mix, and adverse currency movements.", "Looking forward, in fiscal year 2016, we still expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 60%, assuming current exchange rates. If gross margin drivers like currency fluctuation and geographic and product mix move beyond their expectations, they could swing this range further.", "As we discussed last quarter, we expect to progressively see the benefits from our cost out programs, including procurement, production, and logistics improvements, reflected in our fiscal year 2016 gross margin. In particular, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we expect to see a benefit from a normalized sea/air freight mix and from the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar.", "Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $111.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%, primarily due to higher employee compensation and the impact of recent acquisitions.", "SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 27% compared to the year-ago figure of 29.1%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2016.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $27.2 million, a decrease of 9% over the prior-year quarter, but on a constant currency basis, an increase of 12%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year-ago figure of 7.9%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2016. This reflects our ongoing commitment to investing in our diverse product pipeline, including informatics solutions, but also the benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $2.3 million for the quarter, while stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, compared to 18.3% in the prior-year quarter. You may recall in the prior-year tax rate, this was favorably impacted by a net tax benefit of $3.2 million, arising from the conclusion of a long-running German tax audit. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016 will be in the range of 19% to 20%.", "Operating profit for the quarter was $98 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. However, net income for the quarter declined by 3% to $80.4 million as a result of foreign currency hedging losses and lower interest income.", "Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.57, a decrease of 2% over the prior-year quarter. Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the impact from the weaker euro, largely offset by the weaker Australian dollar.

We will now turn to Q&A, and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue.", "Melissa, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.", "Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could perhaps talk through the guidance a little bit. There's been some changes. So I think at the full year result you talked about an SG&A range of 27% to 28%. That's come down by 100 basis points. And the tax rate guidance has also come down by 100 basis points as well. I'm just wondering what's changed in the last three months to see those things come down.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Brett, do you want to have a go at that?", "Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I'll take that, Mick. Thanks. Yeah, Ian, that's right, we have guided that down a little in SG&A. As Mick mentioned, we've been focused on the operating leverage throughout the group and we do think we can achieve that through fiscal year 2016.", "So with some of the plans we have, we do believe that we can bring that down a little and provide some operating leverage there. So on the SG&A front, we feel confident we should bring that guidance down where we see some improvements we're planning throughout the year.", "On the effective tax rate, it moves around a bit with geographic mix. If you look at last year's sort of full-year underlying tax rate, it was sort of around that 19.5% level. So it's kind of in that range. So we just brought that down a tad just based on where we see the forecast going out.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.", "Okay. And then in a similar vein, you mentioned the gross margin. You kept that guidance the same, but you did sort of flag that various movements could see you go out of the range. It is a very wide range and this result was pretty much in the middle of the range. I'm just wondering what sort of things could drive it materially outside that range.", "Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "We did widen that a little bit, Ian, really because there's, if you look at it over the last year or so, quite a bit of volatility on exchange rates. For example, you're seeing the Aussie come down something like 7%, 8%, which is quite significant. Now I'm not suggesting that that's going to happen again this year, but, as you know, anything is possible.", "And we're also seeing some pretty significant movements or some big outperformance on flow generators, particularly in the U.S. So I suppose as a caveat, there's always quite a bit of volatility around the gross margin. It's probably the hardest number to predict. So we widened that out a little bit.", "I think as we get through the course of the fiscal year, we can probably get some more confidence on sort of the band or how wide that is. But at this stage early in the fiscal, we've left it as is. But I have said there that certainly on the things such as freight, where we are normalizing that now, certainly doing a lot less air freight as we have the inventories at levels that we think are appropriate. That's certainly going to help us into Q2.", "And, as you know, the Aussie dollar has depreciated more recently. There's about a quarter's lag on that, so we don't really see that benefit until Q2. But that benefit will be meaningful as well going into Q2. I guess some of the headwinds we're facing are kind of abating a little bit, and so we should be able to see some improvements throughout fiscal year 2016.", "Ian Abbott - Goldman Sachs (Australia) Pty Ltd.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative commentary on what helped the mask growth this quarter. I mean, you had, I guess, a little bit of easier comp, but certainly saw some acceleration there. If you could talk about any products or trends or pull-through, things that might help us to understand how the mask growth could progress.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks for the question, Matt. Yeah, that allows us to talk about the mask business in total. I mean, what we've seen over the last three quarters is clearly some good growth turnaround and success in masks. It's not driven by brand new products; it's more driven by us focusing on partnering with our customers around understanding resupply.", "And as I said in the prepared remarks, we've invested a lot these last 12 months in getting well over 1 million bedside tables with 100% cloud-connected devices that now enable us to have information on patients. And we're able to take those data to the cloud and contact patients and encourage them and drive patient adherence and work with our HME providers in the U.S. and with our other partners in other countries around the world to give patients appropriate access to masks and accessories as they need them over the time of their therapy. And I think you're just seeing the very start of the roadmap of us working on those informatics systems and leveraging them to drive mask and accessories resupply, but I think that's been a factor in the equation.", "As you said, the comp was not incredibly difficult. And so having 9% growth in the Americas over the comp is somewhat a result of that comp. But I think it's more due to the fact that we're focused on resupply, we're partnering with our customers on it and we're really establishing tools and capabilities that are automated, scalable and replicable. And so that gives us a long runway throughout the fiscal year to be able to drive resupply in masks and accessories.", "Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. And just to follow up on that, could you give us any metrics that you're tracking or some kind of a guidepost on resupply to help us understand the improvements you've made and maybe where you could go? I don't know if it's masks per year or how you think about it? And then you mentioned price was stable in masks. Any changes outside the U.S.? I think your comment was on the Americas.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead, who's probably closer to the business and any metrics we're looking at from the resupply, but we may or may not want to release that.", "James Hollingshead - President-Americas", "I don't think we'd want to talk about metrics that we put on the resupply business. I think what I'd add to Mick's comments about the Americas market, in particular on masks, is that we've been talking for several months about the pricing strategy we made a while ago. And those pricing changes have now annualized, so one of the things that allowed us to show a better revenue growth number this quarter was the pricing has really stabilized for us.", "We're the mask market leader both in the Americas and globally. In particular, our Air Fit range is very well positioned. And so we continue to enjoy good volume growth just in the mask business with patients getting \u2013 new patients getting masks. And then, with the efforts we made in automating resupply and driving resupply, we've enjoyed the growth on the back end of that, but I don't think we want to get into sort of ratios and metrics on that at this point.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And maybe the second part of the question, which focused beyond the U.S., the global aspects, Rob Douglas, our COO, any thoughts on that?", "Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, Matt. Globally, the masks are performing well. The AirFit range is a very strong mask range, and we are very competitive with those masks. Our teams work hard with our customers and they've got strong relationships around the world. And we're confident those masks are going to keep performing strongly.", "Matt C. Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sean Laaman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if we could get a bit of a guide on device growth ex-ASV, if possible.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sean, I don't think we're going to release a new metric on this earnings call. I mean, the bottom line is, as we said in May, less than 7% of our global business is in the ASV side of the business, and it's obviously reduced from that over these last sort of 150 days. The growth that we saw \u2013 pretty phenomenal growth of 39% in the Americas, flow generators, and on a constant currency basis, 5% growth of flow generators in EMEA and APAC combined \u2013 was driven really by the new launch of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 and the Astral. And so those have been driving the growth.", "Europe clearly had a bit of a headwind due to the contraindication for heart failure patients with a reduced ejection fraction and predominant central sleep apnea, where we issued that contraindication. But as I also said in the prepared remarks, we really have not seen any impact on ASV beyond that in the other market segments, if you like, that we sell the product in. So it's been pretty steady in that.", "But, Sean, yeah, I don't want to start breaking out ASV and non-ASV mask growth for competitive reasons, and also just for the fact of \u2013 we've got quite a lot of runway left on those product launches, and I want to just look at the macro numbers as they come out.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.", "Sure, Mick. Thanks. Can I just squeeze one more in? Just to clarify, with respect to mask pricing in the U.S., is that fully lapped yet, or is it a next quarter event when it's fully lapped, the reduction in mask pricing?", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Sean, yeah, you're referring to, I think, the January through June 2014 price changes, which have now lapped because we passed \u2013 we lapped the June 2015 timeframe. So we are now fully lapped on those ASP reductions and we're back to sort of steady, as we said, pretty steady mask pricing.", "And we're seeing often our competitors out there competing on value of what the masks can achieve in terms of patient fit, quiet, comfort, first time fit and patient acceptance.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley (Australia) Ltd.", "Great, Mick. Thanks. That's all I had. Appreciate your time.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia with Northland Securities. Your line is open. Suraj, your line is open.", "Your next question comes from Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you can please talk to the different market growth you're seeing in the U.S. between flow gens and masks. Do you think the market for both categories is growing at a slightly decent rate? And if so, what are some of the trends that are driving that/ Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I'll start at a high level and then hand over to Jim maybe for some detail. Globally, we see the sleep apnea market in general growing in the mid-single digits. As you saw from these numbers, we don't accept market growth. We drive ResMed growth and we want to meet or beat those market growth numbers. And so we were able to beat across our businesses, able to beat both mid-single-digit numbers in flow generators and in masks.", "The commentary I'd make before handing to Jim is that the high flow generator numbers we saw particularly in the Americas were driven by new product launches, and a lot of that was share gain based upon the value prop of the Informatics systems, the air solutions that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So, less to do with the differential between flow gens and masks, they are more to do with the value prop of air solutions.", "But, Jim, any more color from the rest of the market, the Americas market?", "James Hollingshead - President-Americas", "Yeah, I think that's spot on. I think the difference you see in the numbers is we've, on a longstanding basis, been the mask market leader. But with the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10, we've taken significant market share over the last several months since the launch of both of those product lines. And that's due both to the fact that those product platforms, just as products, as flow generators, are outstanding products.", "But really it's about, as Mick has just said and said in his opening comments, it's about the all-in solutions offer, the Air Solutions platform is driving significant revenue growth in business efficiencies for our customers, and they're recognizing that. And as they continue to recognize that and adopt the overall Air Solutions platform, they're of necessity buying more of our flow generators to enjoy those benefits. So really there's not a separate growth number behind those two product categories. The underlying market growth is the same, we're just taking more share in flow gen.", "William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. And are you seeing any change in the way private insurers are funding or reimbursing CPAP in terms of moving from a fee-for-product model to perhaps a capitation or a per-patient model? Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, the U.S. market particularly is evolving from a fee-for-service market to really a value-driven or a fee-for-value driven market as a whole. And you're seeing more models like the Kaiser Permanente model, the Intermountain Healthcare model, the Geisinger model start to come into play. And the government is trying to replicate those really solid private company payer provider models with its accountable-care organization or ACO models and its IDN models.", "And we are very good partners with Kaiser, with Intermountain Health, and with Geisinger. But also with the governments of the United Kingdom, the governments of Sweden, the governments of Norway, the governments of Finland, where a payer provider model has been in place for many decades. Since World War II, almost all of Western Europe adopted socialized medicine systems, public health care. And we've been working for the last 25 years with systems of fee-for-value or providing value models. And so we're very used to that type of environment. So the U.S. is undergoing an evolution. Are we a part of that evolution? And I think the informatics capability that we have, the ability to take data to the cloud and share it with patients to drive adherence is amazing, to take costs out of the system for the providers is very valuable.", "But the data to do population health management for a payer or a payer-provider is an opportunity through our data exchanges that we are really just starting to extrapolate. So I think your question is probably a little bit ahead of the curve as to where the value is, but we are working with systems in this new payer-provider, fee-for-value model. And we're actually really excited about that transition because our market shares are incredibly strong across Western Europe and we think we can do that in all the payer-provider models that are out there.", "William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Unknown Speaker", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Victor Windeyer with Citi. Your line is open.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Hi, guys. Thanks. Well, I just wanted to ask a few things related to the ASV product. So you drew out that the pullback in Europe has been a little bit larger, a little harder than you had expected, and that Asia and Americas were in line with your expectations. I just wonder with Asia given the high use of ASV in the high (39:12) population, first, you had with the positive reimbursement in that location. Do you expect further pullback in Japan as awareness of SERVE-HF results close out through there? And then is the Curative Medical acquisition and revenue and associated gross profit enough to offset that should that occur?", "And then in terms of the preserved ejection fraction population that you mentioned, what's happening with the CAT-HF study given the mixed population of that enrolled patient population there?", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Victor. Well, that was a great way to get three questions in one, so I'll try to address all of that, Vic. Yeah. The first part of your question was about the ASV impact being more in Europe and less in Americas and Asia. And I think part of the genesis of your question or the core of the question, kernel of the question was, is it just that the communication is taking time to get from Europe to Asia or Europe to the Americas, and the answer to that is an emphatic no.", "We have, in all the 100 countries we do business in, been incredibly proactive in working with the physician groups, directly writing letters to physician groups and to physicians, working with our providers to contact all physicians and let everybody know about the field safety notice, and that was in the month of May, so north of five months ago now.", "And so that information has been available not only at all the international societies, but in national societies, in all the countries we do business in, and particularly the major ones. So, really, it's not a result of \u2013 the fact that there's been less impact in Asia and Americas is not a result that the communication hasn't gone out there. It's a result of the fact that there was, frankly, less heart failure referrals into our ASV business in those countries. Particularly if you look at the U.S., it was primarily at our business year in the U.S. that was driven by complex sleep apnea or treatment-emergent central sleep apnea driven by opioid-induced central sleep apnea and driven by PTSD, where ASV was used in those applications. And so, there was just less of the business that was coming from cardiology referrals, and so that just wasn't impacted.", "Within Japan \u2013 you mentioned Japan specifically \u2013 the use of ASV in Japan is focused on an acute basis in the hospital. And these data were based on longitudinal data in the home with no data at all about acute effect, and there have been some studies with mutual outcomes on safety but some positive outcomes on some heart failure indicator results, such as ejection fraction and others. And so, the use in Japan has sort of continued on an acute basis because it's a different application. And I don't think that will be affected by SERVE-HF and their ongoing work with Japanese researchers in the field to keep proving their safety but also the efficacy of the product in that area.", "The next part of your question was Curative. Is Curative going to materially offset some of this ASV decline that we're seeing in different parts of the world. I'll hand to Rob. Rob is leading the charge on the Curative integration.", "Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. So, Vic, the Curative acquisition was part of our Three Horizons Strategy, specifically in the second horizon. Talking about positioning ourselves to grow in these markets that look like they're going to be very high growth markets, we only completed the acquisition at the beginning of October, so we're about three weeks into it at the moment.", "I could say it's going very well at the moment. We're just at the CMEF, China Medical Equipment, today. It's a huge medical equipment fair in China. And we had \u2013 showing off our strategy as strategically aligned but operationally independent, we had ResMed and Curative side by side in booths but strongly showing their respective brands, and we're seeing reaction in that market to the two brands that's appropriate for what we look like. So at this stage, we're very confident that that program is going to go well.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And the third part of your question, Vic, was to do with HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and our CAT-HF study. The CAT-HF study is really a pilot study now. We've closed off enrollment and we're going to follow through on all the patients and collect the data from that and likely publish those data as a pilot trial for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction work that we may do in the future.", "I think between atrial fibrillation, to some extent coronary artery disease in a number of markets, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may remain exciting, cardio-respiratory conditions that we are looking at. Given what happened in there, we're unlikely to do a five-year $50 million study in each of these three areas.", "What we're likely to do is partner with payer providers like those I mentioned earlier or governments or small payer-provider groups to run pilot trials to show improved outcomes and improved reduction in hospitalizations on a commercialized basis. So you run pilots that you get commercially paid for that can produce clinical data that may or may not get published but allows you to expand the model. And that's sort of where we're thinking for those three areas. So that includes HFpEF, AF and CAD.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Okay. Thanks very much for that. I just as my follow-up, I'll just ask, is there any evidence that the result from an acute hospitalized heart failure population will be different from the population that's been studied in SERVE?", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, there is, Vic, some indication of that. There was a study published called SAVIOR that was run out of Japan that showed a neutral safety signal but some positive data on the clinical aspects, such as ejection fraction, fluid in the lungs and length of stay in hospital. And so there's some clinical publications in that area on acute HF. You'll likely see more coming out from the Japanese researchers on that front over time.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much. Just on masks, you talked of steady state. We're now at steady state in the U.S. Does that mean we can think of high-single digit mask growth as we look forward?", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Vic, you're jumping to five questions here now, but I'll answer it and then we'll move on. The masks growth that we saw in the U.S. of 9% this quarter was clearly very solid. Look, the market is growing in the sort of mid-single digits range. We look to meet or beat that. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're planning for positive mask and accessories growth throughout the year and we're excited and looking forward to that.", "Thanks a lot for your questions, Vic.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you. Bye.", "Operator", "As a reminder, please limit your question to one and one follow-up. Your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, guys. So first maybe, Mick, if you can talk about what gives you guys confidence that you can really grow generators now in the face of a potential competitive launch from Respironics. If you guys have seen anything in the field and maybe some of those guys coming back to Air Solutions that have trialed that or if (47:04) is active in that HCIT-based device yet.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Margaret. Yeah, clearly, we have seen launch from one of our competitors. The other one you mentioned hasn't launched an HCIT product yet or a cloud-connected sleep apnea product yet and we don't expect in the short term. I'm going to start out by saying it's a huge compliment I think to our innovation and our leadership in the field that our competitors are talking about and starting to follow us into cloud-connected sleep apnea devices.", "We think it's (47:44-48:07) right way to go, we think that the value we extracted, like I talked about, we can improve outcomes and lower costs for the channel and take out waste and inefficiency and get patients more on therapy and follow up with them more to provide appropriate mask and accessories. So I just think as an industry, it's a really good thing that we're all moving to compete on value and drive healthcare informatics-driven sleep apnea solutions.", "Look, clearly maintaining a 39% Americas growth in flow generators in a market where, as I said, it's growing at mid-single digits, it's unrealistic to stay at those types of levels and I don't think you or any of the other sell-side analysts, Margaret, have numbers at that exact 39% sort of rate. But clearly our goal is to not only lock in the share that we already got, but to continue to meet or beat market growth rates, which means by taking share. So that really comes down to is our value proposition better than the competition.", "And from what we've seen of the first competitor to launch their cloud-connected devices is that, frankly, they're not 100% cloud connected. It's got three SKUs of widgets that you need to plug in with three different connectivity modules, which is SKUs for the HMEs to manage. It's not 100% cloud-connected out of the gate in that the DME or the HME or the patient has to take some action to provide the connectivity to the cloud.", "So we think while it's following us in the strategic direction, some of the tactical implementations are not as good as ours. And, really importantly, even when you are connected, it comes down to then competition of whose cloud is better. And I think our healthcare informatics capability on Air Solutions is clearly the leader now. And we intend to maintain that leadership by regular updates, regular value that we provide to both patients, to providers, to physicians and to payers. So we're really excited about the new basis of competition of the industry. It's changed from being just smaller, quieter, more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected and then better connected. So we look forward to that, Margaret.", "Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. And then for my follow-up, Brett, you talked about maybe seeing more of a shift to a normalization for air/sea freight next quarter. So how far along were you guys this past quarter? Did you see any benefit from those cost-outs? Thanks.", "Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Margaret, the programs are in place in a number of initiatives that the team is working on for sure and have got back to that in earnest. We're sort of over that hump of making sure we matched our supply with demand, so we're through all that and we're working through. Typically, what we do with the new platforms is then drive a pretty solid cost-out program on that new platform. So we're now in the throes of doing that. You probably \u2013 maybe a little bit but really, I think more of that will flow through over the course of 2016. And it will be, as I said earlier, it will be more progressive throughout the year, I think.", "Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Wheen with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.", "Yes. Good morning. Just a question on gross margin again. Brett, in the past because of that one quarter lag, you've kind of indicated as to what sort of basis-point improvement we might see from FX in the next quarter. Is that something you could comment on today?", "Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I mean, the sequential impact there if \u2013 and I'm going to caveat this because the exchange rate is moving around all the time \u2013 but if you looked at it on the current exchange rate, it's \u2013 probably the sequential benefit of the weaker Aussie \u2013 it's in the order of 50 basis points, give or take. It's that sort of quantum.", "Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.", "Okay. And then as part of your gross margin commentary. You indicated that mix shift obviously was going against you but also ASP declined. Could you just provide some more color as to where those declines were being felt and what the drivers were?", "Brett A. Sandercock - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I mean, it's not \u2013 we're not giving a lot of granularity around ASP, obviously, from a competitive perspective and so on. But as Mick and Jim mentioned earlier, we've kind of let through \u2013 some of those more kind of acute adjustments we were facing on pricing, we're through that now, so it's very much more of a kind of a typical or historical type marketplace in terms of pricing. So there's still, year-on-year, still an element of declines in selling prices and so on, but they're certainly, in today's environment, much less acute than what we were facing back 12 months ago, for example. So let me say it's kind of a more of a kind of historical normal state of play.", "Steve D. Wheen - JPMorgan Securities (Australia) Ltd.", "Okay. That's great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Goodsall with UBS. Your line is open.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Thanks very much, guys. I was just going to talk to the SG&A. Obviously, up 11% constant currency, and you mentioned some investment in, I guess, emerging markets. Just trying to get a sense of that investment, whether there's much or so in your established markets like EU, and I guess the sort of payback period you're looking for with that investment, I guess, to grow those markets.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Good question, Andrew. I'll hand it to Rob Douglas.", "Robert A. Douglas - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. So, obviously, Andrew, you know we've made some acquisitions in Australia last year, which were a bit of a change in our market model, and that's going very well for us. And then obviously the Curative that we talked about.", "But sort of on a case-by-case basis, our strategy is we will continue to invest locally for the local market development as appropriate, and we've got very strong teams around there. And then we're sort of challenging that with trying to get efficiency with common core processes that let us leverage really the key product range through there.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Terrific. And I guess just a quick follow-up. I know it's been a bit of mention around your competitor's entry to the market. I guess we're expecting that to take place at Medtrade this coming week. Just trying to understand if you've got particular strategies or variations that you bring to the market, I guess, just as a response or to coincide with those events.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good question, Andrew. Clearly, this is a public conference call. So if we have strategies, tactics, and plans to compete with a very clearly known 12-month anticipated product launch, it's not something we'd go through on the earnings call here. But look, the bottom line is, of course, we're ready for competition in this space.", "As I sort of talked to on the response to Margaret earlier, we're quite complimented and excited about the fact that the new base of the competition is healthcare informatics and how good your cloud is. And we're really excited about how strong Air Solutions is, and the value that we provide.", "How well we have done, frankly, the last 12 months of getting north of a million devices out there, connected to the cloud and providing value to those customers. And we know that they've seen the value. Of course they're going to try and sample a new product out there. And we do think that the share we've gained will be something that we build upon because of the value that we're providing. But it's a competitive game and we look forward to it and we're ready for it.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "I know it's adding to the question, probably wasn't phrased particularly well. But I guess the feedback we're getting with the cloud is quite a sticky proposition in a way it wasn't in the past. The flow generator, I guess, just sort of seeing how much you think that gives you a bit of a stronger defense than what you might have had in the past.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I think the value is incredible. I mean, I talked about in the last call, 59% labor cost savings. I talked about on this call, 83% more patient setup with the same labor cost. I mean, these numbers are incredible and these are just the ones that customers have said that it's okay for us to talk about because they're in markets where they sort of have stronger control and they're comfortable sharing those data. The ones in competitive markets are getting similar results and don't want to share the data. Jim, I mean, you're closer to the business on this. Do you want to share any further anecdotes?", "James Hollingshead - President-Americas", "Yeah, I think it's a really good question, Andrew. We feel very confident that we have a superior offer. We're getting what you might term a lot of customer loyalty off of the offer because of the value that it's driving. The device is a better device. It's simpler to use. It's simpler to set up. It has a very elegant and reliable cloud connection built into it, so it's not complex to get a connection to the cloud; and then our software offerings are the only offerings on the market that are proven to increase compliance and therefore increase revenue and to lower costs. And so we feel very confident.", "As Mick said, it's actually good for the market for the basis of competition in sleep apnea to shift towards health informatics because it provides end-to-end care for patients. It will provide better bang for the buck for the entire healthcare system. And it puts us in a very good position because we've enjoyed more than a year long lead in that now, and we'll continue to press that lead, so we feel very confident.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Terrific. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Stanton with CLSA. Your line is open.", "David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.", "Thanks very much for taking my questions and good afternoon. You said, Mick, in your prepared remarks that you had the highest market share globally. I'd be very interested to know what you think your market share is and how you derive that number. That's my first question.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, David. Absolutely willing and happy to say that we are the market share leader. I don't want to go \u2013 we're in 100 countries, and I don't want to go into individual countries or individual market shares within any of those individual countries. But as you've seen these really, really strong high double-digit growth numbers over these last four quarters in flow generators and look at the number of devices that we've sold and the market share and your assessment of the market. I think you'd be pretty confident, and pretty much every sell-side analyst out there would be pretty confident that we're the market share leader in not only flow generators, but also in masks globally. But we don't sort of want to go into the details of it, David, for competitive reasons.", "Look, the main thing about market leadership is not just the market share leadership but the fact that you're innovating better and driving value. And I think one of the core parts of this is providing value for the end users in this whole system, who are the patients. We provide the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, and most connected care altogether to patients, and I think that's what's really driving our growth and leadership. And frankly, it's a challenge for us and anyone else playing in the field to continue to do that. And that's what the game is going to be going forward, providing that long term value to patients.", "David Stanton - CLSA Australia Pty Ltd.", "Thank you. And I wonder if you could give us an update, basically following on from previous questions, can you give us an idea of the replenishment, the mask replenishment environment in the U.S. in terms of payers? Are payers more or less willing to see mask replenishment than perhaps they were even a year or two years ago? Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Thanks, David. Replenishment is a really important part of sleep apnea care because the masks do degrade over time and become more leaky. And to have a patient on sleep apnea care \u2013 for a payer who is following it properly, a payer provider who is following it properly, the investment of $100-odd on a mask every six months to keep a patient out of hospital where a visit to a hospital can cost $2,000 to $3,000 to $5,000 just walking in the door and spending one day there.", "The return on investment for our payer providers who are really following this model closely amongst their sleep apnea patients, their COPD patients, their neuromuscular disease patients, their (1:01:08) patients, the ROI is a no-brainer when you've got the data. I think our informatics solutions are allowing us to have the data to provide the payer-providers and show that ROI.", "And so, I think you are transitioning from sort of a world of utilization management, where people just think of unit costs in a fee-for-service world, to a world of care management where people are thinking about holistic costs to the patient and what it costs to not provide the diabetes supplies or to not provide the hypertensive meds or to not provide the sleep apnea mask. And it's saying, I'm going to cut back on diabetes supplies to save myself money when then the diabetic is back in the hospital or to cut back on the number of masks and, therefore, have the sleep apnea patients show up at the hospital is sort of a 1980s way of looking at things in the utilization management front.", "So I think we are seeing that transition and I think that the payers are really moving to that world of ACOs and payer-providers and looking to mimic the model of those successful payer-providers. But it's a transition world and we are playing in both the fee-for-service world and in the care management world and balancing between the two very carefully.", "Operator", "We are now at the one-hour mark, so I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, thanks a lot, Melissa. And thanks for all the good questions. In closing, I want to thank the more than 4,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished in creating the market-leading innovation in connected care and healthcare informatics solutions in our medical devices. And we remain focused on our long-term goal of changing 20 million patient lives by 2020.", "Thanks a lot and we'll talk to you all in 90 days.", "Operator", "This concludes ResMed's first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings live webcast.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Susan, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Susan, and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects of the Company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us on today, as we summarize our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We have made great progress towards our long-term ResMed 2020 goals this quarter. We achieved solid double-digit constant currency revenue growth led by strong regional results in the Americas.", "Last week, we announced the acquisition of Inova Labs based in Austin, Texas. This acquisition expands our respiratory care therapeutics portfolio for COPD each now include portable oxygen concentrators.", "First, I\u2019ll discuss our top and bottom-line results, I\u2019ll then review some regional highlights from our business and progress on our ResMed 2020 strategy. After that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Brett our CFO to walk you through our financial results in greater detail.", "For the fifth quarter in a row, our global team achieved double-digit top line revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We saw strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 17%. We achieved solid steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regional groups. These global results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud-based connected care software platform, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms.", "Looking at the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share was $0.69 on a non-GAAP basis. We have been balancing our investments and growth opportunities, and significantly expanding our install base of cloud connected medical devices. At the same time, we have been efficiently managing our OpEx growth in both R&D as well as SG&A. This quarter, we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our top line growth. We continue to invest for the future in research and development, maintaining our R&D investment level at around 6% to 7% of top line revenue.", "Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region, we had very strong sales performance in Q2, with our commercial team driving to 17% growth in a competitive market. Flow generator growth in the region was 23%, reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms powered and catalyzed by Air Solutions software. The mask and accessories categories grew at a solid 11% in the Americas for Q2. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth throughout fiscal year 2016 and beyond.", "We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 7% on a constant currency basis in Q2. We continue to see good growth in our sleep disorder breathing business and our respiratory care businesses in these regions. The headwinds that we have faced from the SERVE-HF trial results of May 2015m continued to be annualized through the P&L and this will continue until May 2016.", "The ASV sales impact for Q2 in Europe was broadly consistent with last quarter. As we noted during our last quarter investor call, the ASV sales impact in the U.S. continues to be less than that in Europe. The ASV platform remains an excellent therapeutic solution for a number of important clinical applications including one, treatment emergent central sleep apnea; two, opiod or pain management induced central sleep apnea; three, post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD.", "This quarter, we acquired Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark. These forward vertical integration acquisitions have proved very valuable to us in the past, we expect this to be the same. We also expect that our partnership with the great team at Maribo which is now part of ResMed Denmark will allow us to continue to lead in market development in the country and to build connected care and digital health solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and beyond.", "Now, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Before going to the three horizons, I\u2019d like to talk about three key underlying enablers of our strategy. The first of these is our global leadership in healthcare informatics, the second is our expansion in high growth geographic markets, and the third is a focus on our best in class operational excellence. So, the first enabler on our list is our global leadership in healthcare informatics.", "Connected care and digital health are almost now industry buzzwords that are referred to by many companies in the space. We\u2019re not just talking about it, we\u2019re executing on this front with over 1 million cloud connected medical devices, sending data every morning to the cloud, and more than 750 patients signing up every day for our patient application called myAir. We are transforming ResMed into a tech-driven medical device leader.", "Our first step on this journey has been changing the basis of competition in our core sleep apnea business. We led the industry 15 months ago with 100% cloud connected medical devices and now our competition has had to follow. We are improving the efficiency of our customers by embedding our software solutions in their work flow and providing value to providers, physicians and patients by improving patient device adherence and therefore patient outcomes. We can leverage this core competency from sleep apnea into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD into neuromuscular disease and other chronic disease spaces.", "Our second enabler is our investment and expansion in high growth geographies. Our investment in Curative last quarter is an example of this strategy in action. Curative allows us to have products developed in China, made in China for sale in China. It opens up channels that just weren\u2019t available for imported products. We\u2019ll continue to invest and expand our presence in China, South Korea, India, Brazil and many countries in Eastern Europe. In each country, the value we deliver is to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs for the country in key chronic diseases.", "Our third enabler is operational excellence. It is an important and fundamental foundation to our growth strategy. It\u2019s just part of our DNA. We continue to create efficiencies to allow us to free up cash, to invest back into innovative organic R&D programs and also allow us to better unlock value from our tuck-in acquisitions.", "We take a continuous improvement approach across our entire global business including component supply management, manufacturing excellence, supply chain and logistics optimization, and OpEx management. We are committed to grow our operating profit and to ensure that we have headroom to free up cash to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth.", "Now, I would like to spend a few minutes updating you on progress against our long-term ResMed 2020 growth strategy. In our first horizon of growth which includes our core sleep apnea franchise, our leadership in healthcare informatics remains a critical growth driver. Last month a market research firm, Berg Insight published a report on mobile health and home monitoring. The report ranked ResMed as the number one global leader in connected care for all medical devices. This was not just in respiratory medicine but in all device categories including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and beyond.", "So 15 months after the launch of AirSense 10, AirCurve 10, and Air Solutions the cloud based softer platform, we have achieved this market leadership position. I want to tell you that we are not done. We intend to continue our leadership in connected care and digital health as we add features and enhancements to our solution to bring even more value for providers and physicians, and even better applications for patients to see their own data, to participate more in their own health and wellness.", "With well over 1 million patients, cloud connected medical devices sitting on their bedside tables providing daily updates to the cloud, we are liberating data, providing actionable information, unlocking value, and improving outcomes for patients, physicians, providers and for payors. Our customers are clearly experiencing the value proposition of the AirSense and Air Solutions platform and incorporating this into their workflows, and reaping cost savings in their own P&L.", "On an investor call last year, I referenced a clinical care study that was presented at the American Thoracic Society in which an Air Solutions customers saw patient adherence increase from 73% to 83%, along with the 59% decrease in their own labor costs. Earlier this month, this clinical care study was published in the peer reviewed journal called Sleep and Breathing. We continue to deliver results like this for many of our customers. And many of these are proprietary results that we just cannot share. One study that I was committed to share at the JP Morgan health care conference in San Francisco earlier this month, showed an increase from a very solid baseline of 60% adherence for our customer, the standard care up to top tier patient adherence of 87% when using our cloud-based Air Solutions platform.", "You will see further publications and evidence from us showing increased operating efficiencies for our customers and increased patient adherence like this, all enabled Air Solutions. Connected care is here to stay.", "Our acquisitions of Jaysec and CareTouch have added both ResMed branded resupply solutions combined with an end to end referral and document management system for our customers.", "Our system provides automated resupply solutions to customers, so that they can effectively manage ongoing supplies of masks and accessories to patients via automated text, via e-mail, and even via interactive voice response. We also have a multilingual call center backing up the solution.", "The referral and document management capability reduces days patient and position sign off, reduces the number of errors and incomplete documents, and eliminates a large number of follow-up phone calls. These systems improve both our homecare customers efficiencies and just as importantly, their cash flow.", "In terms of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we announced the acquisition of Austin, Taxes based Inova Labs which we plan to complete this quarter. With this acquisition, we have expanded our therapeutic portfolio to COPD, to include portable oxygen concentrators or POCs. POCs enable patient mobility and fit well with our life support ventilator platform called Astral. Both of these give increased mobility and increased freedom back to COPD patients.", "Inova Labs fits well with our respiratory care strategy and our innovative company culture here at ResMed. We know that we can manage the business to add to ResMed shareholder value. We even know that we will have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels. We will work to prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into maximize physician, provider, and patient value. We will also be able to bring global operational and technological capability to create economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing and logistics at Inova Labs.", "Finally, together with the team in research and development in Austin and Sydney and beyond, we can create next generation products that leverage our healthcare informatics leadership to create solutions for connected care for COPD.", "Finally, I would like to review our third horizon of growth. Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities in new markets including atrial fibrillation, nocturnal asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. Rob and I and others from our team attended the Consumer Electronics Show or CES earlier this month in Las Vegas. Almost every variable and non-variable health and wellness technology at CES included sleep as part of their offering. This clearly shows that there is a demand from consumers to measure, monitor and improve their sleep. Our S+ by ResMed sleep wellness tool is just our first foray into this space. Consumers realize that sleep health is as important as cardiovascular exercise and good nutrition for overall health, and we agree.", "We also continue to explore clinical areas of interest in adjacent market. For our more than 26-year history, our team at ResMed has emphasized relationships with key opinion leaders in pulmonology, cardiology, neurology and related clinical areas. Through our recent $5 million gift to the University of California at San Diego, we have helped to establish a world leading center for clinical care and medical research in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD, the two most costly and most important clinic diseases in the field of respiratory medicine. You will see plenty of exciting developments in the field from this team. One recent example was a sleep apnea and cancer symposium at UCSD that worked together key opinion leaders in pulmonology with KOLs from oncology to discuss the impacts of sleep disorder breathing and specifically repetitive hypoxia on cancer cell development.", "Although these discussions are still in their early days, literally at the molecular level, this is just one of many new clinical areas that could lead to new therapeutics and solutions for patients that ResMed could provide in the future.", "So returning back to our quarterly results, we remain active on the capital management front. And this quarter in Q2, we bought back 700,000 shares. In addition to funding our dividend and completing the acquisitions of Curative Medical and Maribo Medico.", "We continue to look for potential acquisitions where these three criteria are met: One, the business is aligned with our long-term ResMed 2020 drug strategy; two, we can leverage the asset to increase ResMed shareholder value; and three, really importantly, that there is a cultural fit between the business team and ResMed. We clearly hit and nailed all of these three criteria with our acquisition of Inova and our acquisition of Maribo. And we will continue to refresh our acquisition radar screen with further growth opportunities as we move forward.", "We are the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly in products and solutions innovation in connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly for patients all around the world.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brett for a more detailed review of our Q2 financials. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Mick. Revenue for December quarter was $454.5 million, an increase of 7% over prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 13%. Movements in exchange rates, predominantly a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $21.7 million in the second quarter.", "At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $269.5 million, an increase of 17% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and APAC totaled $185 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. However in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and APAC increased by 7% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking our revenue between product segments, Americas flow generator sales were $136.5 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $133 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and APAC, flow generator sales were $123.5 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 6%. Masks and other sales were $61.4 million, a decrease of 2% over the prior year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%. Globally in constant currency terms, flow generator sales increased by 14% while masks and other increased by 10% over the prior year quarter.", "During the quarter, we incurred restructure expenses of $6.9 million associated with rationalizing our European R&D and manufacturing facility. These operations have been integrated in their existing largest care locations. Restructure charge consists primarily of severance payments and an asset write down of a legacy manufacturing facility.", "Additionally, during the quarter, we released $2.4 million of an accrual associated with our SERVE-HF field safety notice activity, as we substantially conclude the obligation arising from the field safety notification.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of restructure expenses and the SERVE-HF accrual released in the current quarter, as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles, both in the current year and last year. We\u2019ve reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.", "Non-GAAP gross margin for the December quarter was 58.1%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 410 basis points, reflecting an unfavorable product mix, declines in average selling prices, and an unfavorable geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. However, on a sequential basis, non-GAAP gross margin improved slightly increasing from 58% in the September quarter.", "Given current exchange rates and taking into account the current trending products and geographic mix combined with the impact from our cost out programs and our recent acquisitions, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016.", "Moving onto operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $118.2 million, a decrease of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 4%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26% compared to the year ago figure of 29%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $29 million a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter, but in constant currency terms an increase of 14%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.4% compared to the year ago figure of 6.9%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the remainder of fiscal year 2016.", "This reflects our ongoing commitments to investing in our diverse product pipeline including informatics solutions, but also a benefit of the weaker Australian dollar in which the majority of our R&D is denominated.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.4 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million.", "Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% compared to 21.1% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year will be in the range of 20% to 21%.", "Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $116.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $97.5 million, also an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $9.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.69, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.64.", "Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted second earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar, partially offset by the weaker euro.", "Cash flow from operations was a record $147.4 million for the quarter, this reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in the net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $12.9 million while depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $21.5 million. We continue to be active on the capital management front. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, additionally during the quarter we repurchased 700,000 shares for consideration of $40.1 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.", "During the quarter we completed three international acquisitions, Curative Medical based in China; Maribo Medico, our distributor in Denmark; and then a precision tooling company located in Sydney. These acquisitions were funded by utilizing our existing cash balances. Additionally, this month, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Inova Labs. Inova Labs is a U.S. domiciled entity and this acquisition will be funded by utilizing our existing credit facility. We expect to include Inova Labs in our consolidated results in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.", "For the rolling 12 months ended December 31, we returned 84% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve returned 98% of free cash flow to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong. Net cash balance at the end of the quarter was $257 million while December 31 total assets stood at $2.2 billion and net equity was $1.5 billion.", "And with that I\u2019ll hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question please. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Susan, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I was hoping to start off on the generator side and the performance in this quarter again very, very strong. Just curious as far as what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace with this product now out there today, are you guys competing head to head? And if so, it seems like you\u2019re continuing to be very successful. Is that a trend that we should expect going forward.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Matt. Yes, that allows us to talk about our Air Solutions portfolio and AirSense 10 and how it fits in the market. I\u2019ll have a first go and then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead to talk a little bit about Americas business and what\u2019s happening there with the AirSense 10 launch.", "So, as I said in the remarks earlier, we have had competitors follow us into the space with the cloud-connected devices. We think our offering is superior because it\u2019s 100% cloud-connected and requires a channel to do nothing other than plug it in and breath, and in the morning the data go to the cloud, and then can be accessed by the patient on myAir or the physician on AirView or the payor provider through an API from Air Solutions. And we think it\u2019s a really strong value proposition taking up to 60% of the labor costs out of the channel for them. And it\u2019s just a really important improvement to their P&L. And it\u2019s really embedded in their workflow and becomes something that they are doing well.", "We believe in competition; we like healthy competition; and we like the fact that our competitors are looking to compete on value offerings, not just in the flow generators segment but in the masks segment and looking to compete with technology. And so, as we look forward, the market growth rate is in the mid to high single digit numbers. We like to meet or beat market growth rate; we don\u2019t except it, we drive beyond that. That\u2019s sort of where we are at. But Jim, anymore color on the Americas?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Thanks Mick. We are very confident in our offering. I mean the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 platforms have been very, very well-received. We have taken lot of -- we\u2019ve taken a significant market share and the Air Solutions inclusion in that. So, as Mick is saying, I think we\u2019ve now clearly proven to our customers that we can drive efficiencies in their business with the platform. So that\u2019s a very compelling offer, remains a very compelling offer, even in right of competitor launches. We obviously have big comps that we are going to work through. And so your question was about sustainability, we intend to continue to grow our program, position above market growth rate. But given the share we\u2019ve taken, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sustainable indefinitely, [ph] the growth rate you\u2019ve seen this quarter.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, talking about the Inova acquisition, just curious as far as where they were selling historically and where you can take that device fairly quickly? And then the investments that you\u2019re going to need to make in support of it, is activity pretty sizable and then how does that business affect the financial make up of ResMed? I think that the gross margin profile and operating margin profile likely be somewhat of a headwind going forward.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Matt. The Inova acquisition is a great opportunity for us; it\u2019s our first foray after 26 years of positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation, and dental treatment, so our first foray into portable oxygen concentrators. And it\u2019s a great technology, has great mobility and gives great freedom back in terms of the battery life and the weight of these portable oxygen concentrators. Yes, when you look at our scale and selling into 100 countries, Inova currently sales into five to maybe 10 countries. So, you\u2019ve got a 10 to 20x multiple, just on the number of geographic countries that we can move into. And so, we are really excited about it. I might ask Rob -- Rob Douglas, our COO, President and Chief Operating Officer and I were touring the plant in Austin last week just before JP Morgan and it was great to walk around and see all the team and to get a feel for the innovation. Rob, any further comments as to the investments and what we need to do going forward?", "Rob Douglas", "Yes. I mean obviously Inova is at a scale not where ResMed is at but they are at a scale that ResMed use to be at. And so, walking around the factory, there\u2019s lot of a very similar approaches to what ResMed have taken in the early days. And we know that we can actually share a lot of experiences and working and integrating those teams, we can really accelerate the development of way that -- way those products go and how we take them into the market. Huge amount of opportunity there, really good cultural fit; it\u2019s going to be very exciting for us all to work in that area.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Low of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open.", "David Low", "First, I just had a question around pricing, I mean really there has been the experience of competitive bidding round two and what that led to and how the manufacturer process, just wondering what your experience has been as we head into international roll out of competitive bidding?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Dave. Competitive bidding has been in play for almost seven years now, CB1, CB2 and then the national expansion that is going on, as we speak from January 1 through July 1. So, these obviously have had an impact. We have talked about that over the last number of quarters on our customers, and we have worked with our customers to make sure that we can help them approve the efficiencies of their P&L and drive to a profitable growth through all of this in the value chain so that we can continue to serve patients and invest in infrastructure. A lot of our investments around Air Solutions are about taking 50%, 60% of the cost -- the labor cost out of the channel and so therefore improving the P&L.", "Obviously acquisition price hold [indiscernible] are in their P&L as well but when you\u2019re able to take 60% of the labor cost that frees up a lot of cash for reinvestment in their business. And it\u2019s really bringing a technology solution into apply. I would characterize the pricing environment as historic normal and what it has been over the last number of many years. We don\u2019t go to quantitative detail of that for competitive purposes, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s at historic normal levels.", "David Low", "I think to follow up on the same topic, I guess what I\u2019m looking for is a little bit of comfort that what we saw with right round two where I think your commentary was quite similar at this after just announced that we\u2019re not -- or that you\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re not going to see [ph] the dynamic with the competitors I think in -- the competitors push pricing down and raise ResMed in due course followed. Are you concerned that there is a risk of that playing out gain or...", "Mick Farrell", "Yes Dave, I can\u2019t predict the psychology of other players in the market. I can tell you what we\u2019ve done and what we continue to do, which is we bring technology into play that improves the P&L for our value chain. And we really understand how that value chain operates. And we\u2019ve got embedded into the workflows and really helped partner with industry to take those costs out. And we will continue to do that in the future.", "Other players in the marketplace have followed and produced similar technologies. We don\u2019t think they are quite as good but they\u2019re doing similar things which is looking to take labor costs and inefficiencies out of a system. And frankly, together we aimed our competitors in the space, are fighting the real competitor, which is frequent [ph] in the hospital and getting those patients with sleep apnea and COPD rather than going back to the ER taking care of them by product on bedside table and using data from that to get back to the hospital system, back to the API system, so that they know that they kept out of play.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos of Morningstar is on line with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Chris Kallos", "Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask in light of the acquisitions and Inova in Denmark, how does that affect your CapEx going forward? Can you provide some you guidance on that?", "Mick Farrell", "Brett, do you want to take that question?", "Brett Sandercock", "I mean it\u2019s the CapEx that sort of run at around -- let\u2019s go to sort of run rate 13, 14, 15 in the quarter something like that. In terms of Maribo, it\u2019s very much a distributor, so it\u2019s not a lot of [indiscernible] product that one, so I don\u2019t see too much impact there. To move to things like Inova, probably be a small uptick but pretty negligible, fairly small operation at the moment. I think the big one on that in terms of investment, they\u2019re not big; where we\u2019ll incrementally put some money I think is in R&D, really think we can turbo-charge those products and them very effective. And obviously with our distribution channel capability, what we can bring to the table, we very much think that we can grow that business very nicely. So, pretty -- some small investments but nothing significant.", "Chris Kallos", "And just a follow-up on the R&D in Inova, are you planning on keeping that domiciled in the U.S. and how does that affect your 6% to 7% forecast on R&D?", "Mick Farrell", "Rob, do you want to take that question maybe or -- we have Rob, why don\u2019t you go first and then maybe Brett can answer.", "Rob Douglas", "We\u2019re still working on integration plans and finalizing how that\u2019s going to work. But we don\u2019t see in the short-term major moves. It\u2019s a really good team in Austin, who really know the stuff around that and they have confidence and we\u2019re very keen to maximize the value of that. In terms of ongoing [indiscernible] made a short-term bit of investment in the R&D, but long-term that shouldn\u2019t change how we think about the right level of investment for R&D for our overall business.", "Operator", "Anthony Petrone with Jefferies is online with the questions. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great, thanks a lot. One quick for Brett and then I\u2019ll follow-up with the question on just some CMS news that was coming out late last year. Just Brett on the acquisitions in the quarter, they were three that -- one was we were aware of but the other two in terms of distributor work or integration we were not aware of. So what was the collective contribution just from those three acquisitions in the quarter in terms of revenue and EPS? And then one follow-up. Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I mean these are pretty small acquisitions, so not going down to that granularity. I think we did for those ones, not material from our perspective, so we haven\u2019t disclosed too much detail on that.", "Anthony Petrone", "And then just from a margin perspective, this vertical integration, will that help offset some of the pressures that you\u2019ve been seeing? And maybe just an update on the transition from I guess area of freight charges which was a tailwind that was potentially coming in the second half of this year. Was there any benefit from that this quarter or do you expect that to be more of a second half event?", "Brett Sandercock", "So, just on the first one, it really -- continuing on the acquisitions, they\u2019re fairly small, so that\u2019s kind of around the ages. But typically with the vertical integration for example in the distribution, that would help, that would sort of be if you like help improve your margins or be accretive to your margin for example. If you look at benefit [ph] example that\u2019s really vertical integration within our supplies and we think we can pick up obviously, it\u2019s for better tooling cost but also improvements in strategically in markets and things like that. So that was what we call it\u2019s not strategic tuck in for us. If you look at acquisitions such as Inova, and I think we highlighted that at the time, there will be a little bit of dilution to gross margin there. So that does present a little bit of a headwind but I think the opportunities are so good for us on that on growing that portable oxygen and concentrator market and our share in the product and so on that I think it was quite compelling for us to do so. We weren\u2019t going to worry about sort of, some sort of myAir margin dilution if you like impact, from not doing the deal, we think it will be pretty compelling in due course.", "And on the freight side of things, we\u2019re seeing some of that coming through and obviously we will see more of that coming through in the second half as well of the fiscal.", "Operator", "And Saul Hadassin of Credit Suisse is on line. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Saul Hadassin", "Thanks very much. Maybe question for Brett as well, on gross margins, jus looking the sequential movement up about 10 basis points. Looking at your mix, product mix, if anything is probably slightly better this quarter than 1Q \u201816. You should had a benefit from a lower Aussie U.S. sort of line, just wondering was there anything holding back that gross margin uplift? For example what was the reference before so that moved to -- is that still to come through? In terms of your underlying gross margin ex the dilution that might come from the Inova just wondering should you -- should we think sequential gross margin uplift over the course of this fiscal year assuming currently holds where it is? Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I mean it\u2019s a little sequentially; we still are seeing an impact on -- negative impact from product mix and also geographic mix. And of course I mean the big standouts obviously you know Americas growth and then the flow generator growth as well, that remains really strong. So, there\u2019s still headwinds for us but in the frame there\u2019s a whole bunch of other stuff. We had a small uplift from FX, you\u2019re right, that was probably around 40 basis points or so. There\u2019s a bunch of other -- there\u2019s other stuff that plays out on that that can impact you kind of quarter to quarter. But overall, I guess you\u2019d characterize that as kind of margins pretty much stabilized. And depending on trends, on product mix and geographic mix I suppose the term is kind of where we land within that kind of guidance band that I gave. So, still working on a way on the cost out programs and so on. We\u2019ve got opportunities there, will flow through into the second half. But then it does -- it depends a lot on the normal product mix, geographic mix, a little bit on the acquisition around the edges, a little of a headwind for us. You\u2019ve got typical declines or mix. So, that\u2019s all in and I said a lot -- quite a lot, it\u2019s pretty hard to predict on the gross margin when you\u2019re looking at kind of 90-day window. But overall I think pretty comfortable with that margin even and clearly we\u2019ll work hard to improve that but we\u2019ve got to be realistic on what we\u2019re seeing with product mix and geographic mix and acquisitions and so on. So rest assured we\u2019re working hard on margin improvement.", "Saul Hadassin", "And just a follow-up on that regarding the ASV sales that you would have not had this quarter, was there any material change to those lost sales relative to the quarter that\u2019s just passed, so relative to 1Q \u201816?", "Mick Farrell", "The ASV sales, as I said earlier, the impact that we saw in Q2 was the same as the impact we saw pretty much in Q1 for Europe. And the impact that we saw in the U.S. was much less than that that we saw in Europe which is again the identical situation to what we saw in Q1, so that you know it\u2019s still going through the P&L being annualized. The impact of SERVE-HF results from May 2015 and we\u2019re in mid January now, so we\u2019ve got four more months of annualizing that through the P&L and then we\u2019ll be clear with sort of annual cost of the ASV impact in May 2016 here in five months -- four months time from now.", "Operator", "And Margaret Kaczor of William Blair is online with a question. Please go ahead, your line is open.", "Margaret Kaczor", "So just to go back to Inova Labs and that acquisition, obviously they have a good product, they\u2019ve got some good advantages. But that said, do you have an interest in bringing a new POC to market, that\u2019s up to the same standards as ResMed, similar to what you guys did with Astral and Sans [ph] and should this be a shorter or longer timeframe or are you happy and willing to continue selling the existing products to your customers today?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, thanks Margaret, good afternoon to you. That\u2019s a good question. It allows us to talk to the longer term play here around Inova. So, Inova is a strong player in the POC market and they have excellent mobility and excellent freedom that they give back to patients because the battery life is best in class and lasts a very long time, similar to what we do with the Astral, lots of what where did 24 hours of freedom back to patients with that. Having said all that and as Rob alluded to earlier, there\u2019s a lot of capabilities that we have from our global business in the 26 years in respiratory medicine here that we can bring some skills to the table for the next generation of products in the portable oxygen concentrator front. And some of that will be some of the engineering around efficiencies, our supply chain logistics, manufacturing, quality reliability and those types of factors that we\u2019ve learned a lot. But really importantly bringing the capability or the core confidence of cloud based healthcare informatics solutions to the able to put a cloud-connected POC as part of end-to-end across the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medical device space, so all the way from noninvasive ventilators, life support ventilators and the portable oxygen concentrators and take that data and be able to give pulmonary and critical care physicians or ACOs data that can really help them understand mobility, freedom, breath right and hospitalization rights of their COPD patients to help them improve outcomes and lower cost. That\u2019s the game. And we do think that we can bring a lot to the table.", "So the short answer is obviously we like the product, we will continue to sell existing products. But we like even more the combination of the Inova portable oxygen concentrator engineering with ResMed\u2019s healthcare informatics engraining, what the two combinations, what that synergy could bring.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Okay, then I don\u2019t know if you had talked at all about the timeframe because obviously it took you guys a little bit a time, sense to bring that kind of a product to market, so should we assume it\u2019s within that 2020 timeframe or longer than that?", "Mick Farrell", "You should assume it within the 2020 timeframe for sure. Yes, the difference between stand, we have got life support ventilators where the life cycle of those is sort of six to seven or even up to eight to 10 years. The life cycle of a portable oxygen concentrator is probably closer to that of the C peptide type device or that sort of time horizon. So yes, we will have a next generation well before 2020.", "Operator", "And Joanne Wuensch of BMO Securities is on line with the question. Go ahead, your line is open.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Could we touch on SG&A please? Revenue was stronger than we expected but you really also pulled in your SG&A; what\u2019s going on there?", "Mick Farrell", "Rob, do you want to just set maybe -- maybe Rob first, Brett and then you can go.", "Rob Douglas", "Joanne, actually we\u2019ve got a number of areas that we are working on. Brett will probably go into few of them but across the board we are running a really strong operational excellence program that not only talks about our products and our supply chain, which we have talked about a lot but we are also moving a lot of that thinking and approach into our SG&A road as well. And so we have done a lot work around the world. We do run our different countries with different go to market models and so the different programs around the world. But we can really call out the U.S. and Americas teams of pulling a lot of operational leverage in and we have got very strong plans around our European teams. So, it\u2019s really easy stuff for us to do, in terms of sharing the way some things work nice and easier. And we are taking a view of that we are freeing up a lot of capacity to continue to invest in innovation and really optimizing these acquisitions as well.", "So Brett, I don\u2019t know if you want to go into little more on some of the areas.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. We\u2019ve adopted to some extent some of the methodologies that they are using with the supply management team and so and being more disciplined around that. So that\u2019s certainly helping a lot and just making sure kind of mindset is thinking to that extent as well in a smart way. And so that\u2019s sort of enabled us to get some pretty solid leverage there. Obviously if you go back last year running, we had for example AirSense and selling and doing some marketing and some variable compensation, that\u2019s more normalized this year, which has helped us a bit as well. And to some extent, you\u2019re getting some currency benefit as well. But even if I normalize for currency, we still -- we see around that 27% mark. So, we\u2019d still be in very good shape, some of those savings or kind of holding expenses tight. And then with revenue growth obviously you get that leverage. So that\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve been working on this for a while and I think it\u2019s just sort of starting to flow through into the P&L now.", "Joanne Wuensch", "And just as a follow-up if I may, I think there is some pricing on Inova clearly going outside of your core OSA type of area into more sort of traditional DME type of oxygen concentrators, what made this be the right acquisition at this time? Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "With respect to -- I\u2019ll disagree that it\u2019s not in our space. Our space is -- ResMed is respiratory medicine. And what we have done in the field of sleep apnea certainly for 25 years is lead that market, and most recently lead it by taking cost out through healthcare informatics and really showing we can improve the efficiencies of the delivery of this amazing noninvasive ventilation and positive airway pressure therapy to patients in sleep apnea. We\u2019d already started within the fields of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with our noninvasive ventilators to help those patients as well, stay out of hospital and get better with COPD through noninvasive ventilation including publication of studies showing that we can actually reduce the mortality rate, so literally save lives of COPD patients with severe hypercapnic COPD with noninvasive ventilation through the current one study that we published. So the extension through that vertical, if you like of the disease state of COPD into the other medical device that is often used in that COPD space which is oxygen therapy.", "Now, we aren\u2019t really doubling down in stationary oxygen, and it does have a stationary oxygen concentrator but it\u2019s actually the only one in the world that the stationary oxygen concentrator can allow a portable oxygen concentrator to connect directly on to it and charge and be there, so that when the patient wants to leave the home. Because these folks are still active folks with COPD, they can grab the POC and see the grand children, get out to the park and play ball with the grand kids and have the freedom back, which is what POC is bringing. The total market for oxygen therapy is $1.2 billion or so, of that around $200 million plus or minus is a portable oxygen concentrator market, but it\u2019s that $200 million portable oxygen concentrator market that has very strong growth, mid to high, even low-double-digit numbers growth in terms of year-over-year. We are really excited to participate in that POC market and to bring our innovation play. And we think it\u2019s a very larger to extension into the vertical of COPD patient treatment and it will become a good -- a great part of our portfolio, not just in the U.S. where it primarily sales now, but globally.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Goodsall, UBS. Your line is open.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Just want to pick up on the mask, obviously it\u2019s second quarter now that you\u2019ve achieved quite good U.S. sales. Just want to understand sort of what\u2019s been behind that; is conversion or I guess better pairings; is again conversion on the compliance rate that data that you\u2019re showing? And then I guess Brett\u2019s probably covered this a little bit, but just how I guess incrementally that continues remarkably that in the margin?", "Mick Farrell", "Okay. I\u2019ll hand the first part of the question. 11% solid growth in masks and accessories in Americas and hand to Jim Hollingshead and then Brett maybe you take the second part of that.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yes. There is a lot going on behind that mask number, just to be -- try to think about it. And the first thing is the price reductions that we\u2019ve put into place in January to June [indiscernible] now completely annualized. So we\u2019re through that. And while the market remains, the mask market in particular remains very competitive, we\u2019re into more of a historic norm kind of pricing situation in masks. Our offering remains very strong in particular the AirFit line of masks are very well received and continues to do very, very well in the market.", "Our recent buy offerings have driven a lot of growth and that is directly connected to our health informatics offering because the acquisition of the providers that we\u2019re now integrating into a program we called ResMed Resupply and that\u2019s an automated resupply program, it\u2019s part of our HI offering that\u2019s helping to grow our mask business. And then we\u2019ve done a number of things. We\u2019ve done a number of -- without getting into the tactics, a number of things in marketing and a number of things with sales compensation and so on, and all of those leverages have contributed to the growth we saw.", "Andrew Goodsall", "And what you\u2019re expecting gross margin\u2026[Multiple Speakers]", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. Brett, you want to address the -- actually sort of a third question, why don\u2019t you addresss the gross margin and then Jim or I will address the ongoing masks...", "Brett Sandercock", "So pretty simply, typically mask margins are higher than flow gen margins. So, to the extent you get stronger growth in mask obviously be supportive to group margin. So that\u2019s kind of the pricing masks.", "Jim Hollingshead", "And in terms of where it goes, I think all the activities we have in place would suggest that that\u2019s stable.", "Operator", "Steve Wheen of JP Morgan is online with the question. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steve Wheen", "Well, thanks very much. The question for Brett, just on the FX typically in the positive given some indication on current exchange rates, what the gross margin impact might be going into third quarter? And then also you\u2019ve often provided the FX impact at the impact [ph] line as well?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. So on gross margin going forward, assuming currently the way they are and they\u2019re particularly volatile at the moment. But we probably sequentially probably get a small uptick but it will be only around 10 basis-point mark Steve, it\u2019d be pretty small sequentially that is point in time. I mean all the sort of types it will be the trajectory and stays there and probably Q4 you\u2019d see that impact on a sequential basis being a little bit bigger than Q3, but for Q3 I think it would be around 10 basis points. So kind of overall net impact from currencies, I do typically give it on EPS. And I think even the commentary was around [indiscernible] this quarter, as we\u2019re starting to see some of that benefit from a lower Aussie dollar kind of kicking through, which is offset to some extent by the way to euro, but we are starting to see the benefit from the Aussie dollar now which is great.", "Steve D. Wheen", "And then just final follow-up. In the past, in the last quarter, you guided towards the effective tax rate going down by 100 basis points. You seem to sort of have changed the stats on that. Could you just give some reconciliation as to what might have changed there?", "Brett Sandercock", "It\u2019s seats around the cost of H1, so probably in the vicinity of 20; it\u2019s around that range Steve, on that. And just it varies around with the basically where the geographically taxable income is. And so we continue to have pretty good numbers out of the U.S. and that\u2019s probably sort of moved it up a little bit. But in the vicinity of that 20%, I\u2019ve just gone with 20 to 21. So maybe sort increase that a shade above where I was thinking from Q1.", "Operator", "And your next question is Sean Laaman on line from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Sean Laaman", "I have a question on myAir, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any way you\u2019ve been able to track or quantify the uptake and usage patterns from patients and any observable benefit to the company? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Great question, Sean. I mentioned that it\u2019s actually now in our investor deck that we\u2019re adding 750 patients per day to the myAir application. And myAir for those who don\u2019t know is an app that can run on an iPhone or an Android, Samsung or whatever device, portable device where a patient can access and interact with their own therapeutic data from their device and trends and gaming and interaction with it. And in the same way that many people around the world are now measuring their steps either with a Fitbit or an embedded app in their Smartphone to try and get the 10,000 steps a day and keep the cardiovascular exercise up. A lot of patients now with myAir are looking to get their score to 100, because we literally give a score out of 100 everyday on how you slept. This includes duration of sleep, probably mask week and efficacy of the respiratory rate and so on throughout the evening. So, it\u2019s an algorithm, if you like that score the patient\u2019s wellness with regard to sleep and their treatment sleep apnea. We\u2019ve seen incredible engagement from patients on it. I talked about 60% adherence going up to 87% adherence with some customers in the case studies from the JP Morgan presentation. I\u2019d tell you a big part of that is engagement with the patients through these cloud-based algorithms that interact, email, text, IVR and psychologically work with patients through these cloud-based capabilities. So we\u2019re really excited about myAir and we think it\u2019s a big contributor. And we\u2019re in mile one of a mask on this one. There\u2019s a long way to go onto the capability for us to engage with patients.", "Operator", "Your last question in today\u2019s question-and-answer session will be from Matt Taylor of Barclays. Go ahead your line is open.", "Matt Taylor", "So, I just wanted to ask you a follow-up on the acquisitions because you\u2019re talking about them very excitedly but also they\u2019re immaterial this quarter. You said Curative was about 1% last quarter, so two things. One is when do they become material as engines more material and then are you going to call them out separately for reporting purposes because most of us just have masks and flow generator models, so it\u2019s hard to recognize.", "Mick Farrell", "So, I\u2019ll let Brett talk to the first part of that materiality and then I\u2019ll talk into a little bit as to why we\u2019re excited about the long term.", "Brett Sandercock", "So, at this stage I mean it\u2019s still not material from accounting stands and even on that aggregate there Matt, so at this stage we wouldn\u2019t -- won\u2019t disclose that in sort of any too much granularity. Now obviously, as we go forward and so on we\u2019ll keep looking at how we report or disclose from a business perspective. But at this stage we\u2019re going through pretty much the same channels and so on, we\u2019ll continue to basically aggregate that into our results and not try to split that out.", "Mick Farrell", "And Matt, just to give you some sort of ballpark on it, we have mentioned that it\u2019s less than 2% of our global revenues, so you can run the math on $1.7 billion that puts it at less than $34 million in revenues. We\u2019re not going to go into exactly what number it is for competitive reasons. But take that number and then also think about the $200 million marker of POCs and think about what ResMed\u2019s done, I guess if you look back over the last 20-25 years in the sleep apnea market where we started from a very small base and have grown to a very strong global leadership, number one position. We would look to do the same in POCs and how we look to do that is the same way we did in sleep apnea, which is innovation and technology. And I talked a lot about the innovation in healthcare informatics and engaging patients. Applying that to POCs we think is a huge opportunity and we\u2019re very excited about being a major player in the POC market, and really importantly rolling that up to a major play around COPD, which is the number three killer in the United States, and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in ERs and ICUs and CCUs. So we think it\u2019s a huge opportunity and we look to be a part of that.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour mark. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Susan. So, in closing I want to thank the more than 4,300 strong ResMed team from around the world for their continued commitment to changing the lives of literally millions of patients with every breath. I\u2019m very proud of what our team has accomplished in creating market leading innovation and connected care, including new product lines, new solutions, new channels that we\u2019ve incorporated into our business portfolio. We remain laser focused on our long-term goal of impacting 20 million lives by 2020. And that impact is literally giving the gift of breath back to each of those patients. Thanks for your time and we\u2019ll talk to you in 90 days.", "Agnes Lee", "All right, thank you again for joining us today for this call.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Andrew and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. ", "We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the filings made by ResMed with the SEC. ", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders for joining us today as we summarize our results for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2016. We delivered solid global growth this quarter led by strong double-digit growth in the Americas region. We made progress executing on our respiratory care strategy by closing our acquisition of Inova Labs early in the quarter. ", "We also made significant progress executing on our connected care strategy by closing our acquisition of Brightree on April 4. For the call today, I\u2019ll first review our top and bottom-line results. I\u2019ll then outline some regional highlights from our business, and finally, I\u2019ll review our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. After that I will hand the call over to Brett to walk you through our financials in greater detail. ", "We have seen strong ongoing success with our global leadership in connected care. For the seventh quarter in a row, our global team achieved market beating topline revenue growth. We exhibited continued strength in the Americas region with robust double-digit growth at 12% year-on-year. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of Air Solutions, our cloud based connected care software system, as well as the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 medical device platforms. ", "We achieved steady growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions, despite the headwind for macroeconomic conditions in Europe. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings-per-share was $0.68 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth. We continue to balance solid revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D innovation and our global focus on operating excellence. This quarter we gained operating leverage in SG&A keeping its growth well below our topline revenue growth. ", "We are investing for the future, maintaining R&D spend at 6% to 7% of our topline revenue. These R&D investments are focused on enhancing our growing portfolio of sleep apnea, COPD, and connected care solutions.", "Now for some regional highlights. In the Americas region we had very strong sales performance in Q3 with our commercial team in that region driving 12% growth against very tough year-on-year comparables. Flow generator growth was 15% in the Americas reflecting the ongoing success of our AirSense 10, our AirCurve 10 platforms, but all powered by our cloud based Air Solutions software including the U-Sleep and myAir apps. ", "The mask and accessories category also grew very well, we have achieved double-digit growth for the last three quarters in this category with 10% growth in the Americas for Q3 in masks and accessories. We continue to expect solid mask and accessories growth as we move forward. We grew our combined EMEA and APAC group at 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter. We saw solid growth in sleep apnea platforms and our respiratory care offerings in the regions.", "It is important to note that the ASV growth headwind from the SERVE-HF announcement in 2015 was significant on a year-on-year basis in Q3. The studies announcement anniversary is May 13, 2016, so we will pass that date in just a few weeks here, after which, those headwinds will begin to subside.", "ASV growth will remain an issue in Q4 with the largest impact on the EMEA and APAC region. We continue to see opportunities for ASV in central sleep apnea, especially in those patients with complex sleep apnea, with pain management medication and also with posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. These all provide a basis for very good growth in ASV for 2017 and beyond. ", "Now, I would like to provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We're making good progress with all three foundations that allow us to drive our strategy. As a reminder, these three foundations are, one our global leadership in healthcare informatics; two, our investment and expansion in high-growth geographic markets; and three, a strong focus on best-in-class talent development, as well as global excellence.", "We continue to make great progress with our global leadership in healthcare informatics. This is truly a core competence for ResMed team and a source of sustainable competitive advantage. With the close of the Brightree acquisition we're continuing to invest in cloud-based computing solutions. These solutions help make our customers more efficient and help them free up cash flow to invest in even better patient care. ", "With well over 1 million cloud connected medical devices sending data every morning to the cloud, we are the world's leading tech driven medical device company. With the addition of the Brightree suite of software solutions we're building an end-to-end solutions offering that provides value for HME, physicians, payers, and for patients. With our channel partners we are improving operational efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence, and improving patient outcomes. ", "We intend to grow our connected care solutions into COPD, as well as other chronic care applications as we continue to execute on our ResMed 2020 strategy. Our second foundation is our investment and expansion in high-growth geographies. Our investment in China with Curative is an example of this strategy in action. ", "Curative is strategically aligned and integrating well with our ResMed China business. Curative has very high quality products that are developed in China, made in China, and sold in China. Curative opens up channels that just aren\u2019t available for foreign made products. We are now leveraging the distribution capabilities of both organizations. We will continue to invest and expand our presence in China and other global high-growth markets including Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. ", "In each geography, the value we deliver is to improve patient quality of life, to improve objective patient outcomes and to reduce national healthcare costs in key chronic diseases. Our third foundation is operating excellence with a focus on developing the best-in-class talent and leveraging our market-leading style.", "We hire and develop the best talent in the industry. The leadership team that Rob and I have assembled is a key part of our competitive advantage in the marketplace. On the operational front, we continue to create efficiencies that allow us to free up cash to reinvest in key innovative R&D programs and also to better unlock value from our acquisitions.", "We are committed to continue growing operating profit ensuring that we have headroom to reinvest in the business and continue to drive profitable growth. These strong foundations are critical to allow us to achieve our ResMed 2020 growth goals. Before handing over to Brett, I would like to take a few minutes to update you on some key milestones of progress against our three horizons growth strategy. ", "In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong sustained growth these last seven quarters. 18 months after the launch of the AirSense 10, the AirCurve 10, and our Air Solutions platform's, we have truly changed the basis of competition in our core market from smaller quieter and more comfortable devices to smaller, quieter, more comfortable devices, but also more connected solutions. ", "While many companies are talking about connected care and talking about digital health, we have executed in connected care and we lead the market with well over 1 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sending data to the cloud every morning. We are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, for physicians, for providers and even for payers.", "With the cloud-based software solution we\u2019re able to add enhancements every couple of weeks, every couple of months, to improve the efficiency of our customers and provide benefits to the whole value chain and especially patients. We continue to integrate to EMR and each EHR systems through the ResMed data exchange. And we recently added functionality within AirView, U-Sleep, and our newest ResMed mask text coaching program that provides daily coaching texts for patients, especially those who are brand new to therapy.", "With the Brightree acquisition we have augmented the Air Solutions platform with an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for our customers. On the market access front, there was a study published on the results of the first large-scale employer program to screen, diagnose, and monitor OSA treatment adherence in the U. S. trucking industry. The study concluded that drivers who were diagnosed and were adherent to our OSA therapy had reduced accident risks, similar to the control group. ", "However, drivers who had not adhered to OSA therapy had a five-fold, that is a five-fold greater preventable crash risk. There is clearly a long road to fully develop regulations in this transportation sector and we\u2019ve been working on this for a number of years, however, this type of clinical evidence of the risks to human life and major costs for the transportation sector are very important steps in the progress.", "In addition, this quarter the largest study in the history of sleep apnea was published by the European respiratory society. The study looked at the effect of gender and age on the co-morbidity burden of obstructive sleep apnea across a group of 1.7 million patients. The study concluded that type II diabetes, stroke, hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and depression were all more prevalent in patients with OSA when compared to the control group, regardless of gender. Bottom line, these data reiterate that sleep apnea remains a huge public health problem and that women are significantly at risk, not just the stereo typical men.", "And a key milestone of progress against the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy we closed the acquisition of Inova Labs early in the quarter. With this acquisition we have expanded our COPD offering to include portable oxygen concentrators or POC\u2019s. POC\u2019s enable patient mobility. This fits very well with the key value proposition of our life support ventilation platform Astral. They both give increased mobility and freedom back to the COPD patient. ", "We have started the integration progress at Inova and we are excited to add these products into our respiratory care portfolio. We have opportunities to grow revenue by filling POC's through our global market channels. We will prioritize the 100 countries that we sell into to maximize physician provider and patient value. We will also be able to bring our global operational and technological capability to create true economies of scale in supply chain management, manufacturing, and in logistics. ", "We will create mix generation Inova products that not only take quality to the next level for the platform, but that also leverage our health care informatics leadership. The strategy is to create connected care solutions for COPD with POC's, life support ventilation, and noninvasive ventilation. Given that we have already created connected care solutions for sleep apnea, we know we can execute to this plan.", "Midway through the quarter a study was published on overlap syndrome, which as a reminder is a cohort of patients who suffer from both sleep apnea and COPD. The study showed that early diagnosis and adherent treatment of sleep apnea in patients admitted with acute COPD exacerbation both reduces hospital readmissions and reduces emergency room visits over a period of six months. ", "The study also projected that these benefits would persist over 12 months. This is great news for patients, hospitals, physicians, and payers. Under the new reimbursement models everyone in the value chain, including hospitals wants to keep COPD patients out of hospitals and in their home and happy. Our ResMed products and solutions will be a key part of this.", "Our third horizon of growth includes a robust portfolio of opportunities in new markets, including a trial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, and also sleep health and wellness. We expect to have some exciting clinical data on our third horizon of growth next quarter. I do not want to steal the thunder from the researchers, so for now I\u2019ll just say watch this space.", "Returning back to our financial results for the quarter, we\u2019ve been able to put our balance sheet to work with the completion of the Inova Labs acquisition and just a few weeks ago, the Brightree acquisition. We have continued our dividend program and for now we have held back our share repurchase program. We believe this approach is prudent given that we have taken on an additional $725 million worth of debt to fund our acquisition of Brightree. It is important to note that we may resume the share buyback program without prior notice in the near future as conditions warrant.", "Let me close with this, we're the global leaders in sleep apnea and respiratory medicine, not just in market share but more importantly with game changing innovation in both products and solutions for the future of connected care. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, our partners, and most importantly the patients around the world.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Brett for more a detailed review of our Q3 financials. Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Great. Thanks, Mick. Revenue for the March quarter was $453.9 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms revenue increased by 9%. Movements in exchange rates, predominately a weaker euro relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenue by approximately $6.3 million in the third quarter. At a geographic level, overall sales in the Americas were $282.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $171.7 million, consistent with the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EME and Asia Pacific increased by 3% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $153.2 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $129 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our Inova sales are included with flow generators under the advised revenue category. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $116.7 million, an increase of 1% over the prior year and in constant currency terms an increase of 3%. Masks and other sales were $55 million, a decrease of 1% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 3%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 10% while masks and other increased by 7% over the prior year quarter.", "During the quarter, we incurred acquisition related expenses of $3.6 million associated with the Inova Labs and Brightree acquisitions. During the rest of my commentary today, I will refer to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the acquisition related expenses as well as the amortization acquired in intangibles both in the current year and last year. We reconciled the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter press release.", "Gross margin for the March quarter was 57.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin contracted by 220 basis points reflecting the impact of changes in product mix, declines in average selling prices and changes in geographic mix partially offset by favorable net currency movements. We estimate the recent Brightree acquisition will have a positive impact of 70 basis points to 100 basis points on our gross margin and with this impact combined with current exchange rates, unlikely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin to continue to be in the range of 57% to 60% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $119.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 26.3% compared to the year ago figure of 27.5%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. R&D expenses for the quarter were $28.1 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter and on a constant currency basis, an increase of 11%. This increase largely reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.2% compared to the year ago figure of 6.4%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $4.6 million for the quarter. The increase over the prior year amortization expense of $2.2 million reflects the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $10.9 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.5% compared to 20.5% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 will be in the vicinity of 20%.", "Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $112.4 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $95.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $88.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68, an increase of 5% over the prior year quarter while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.63. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per share reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar partially offset by the weaker euro. Cash flow from operations was $122.1 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $13.2 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $19.9 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the March quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of March, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program.", "During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Inova Labs effective January 29. The acquisition was funded by drilling on our existing credit facility. Additionally, this month, we announced the close of the Brightree acquisition effective April 04. Brightree will be included in our consolidated results in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The $800 million acquisition was funded by utilizing $75 million in existing cash, relishing a $300 million term line and drilling down funds from our revolving credit facility. Note we have also increased our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion.", "At the close of the Brightree acquisition, we have approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $500 million in net debt. Post acquisition, our balance sheet remains modestly great and very strong. Total assets are approximately $3.3 billion and net equity is approximately $1.7 billion. ", "And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Andrew, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Ian Abbott from Goldman Sachs is online with a question.", "Ian Abbott", "Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on the gross margin, it certainly stepped down again this quarter, you did call out the impact of ASV. I am just wondering why that was particularly an impact this quarter given it would also have been an impact in the prior two quarters.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Ian. There is a number of factors as you know that go into gross margin. One of the impacts is that the ASV as you talked about. If you remember 12 months ago in March 2015, there was the American College of Cardiology and there was a lot of very positive press around heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and ASV, and we really saw those very high margin ASV products this time a year ago do incredibly well in the March quarter, and so we are annualizing if you like a steeper curve on ASV from a year ago and that headwind. And as I say the endpoint of that is the announcement is May 13, 2016 when we annualize that, so there will be six weeks in Q4 with that steep curve as well. That is one factor.", "Another factor impacting gross margin was the outperformance of our Americas team, which is lower than group margin but still very positive gross profit dollars but lower than group margin and the other impact was the outperformance of our flow generator line. So the AirSense 10, and the AirCurve 10, which were lower than group margins but very positive products as a platform together in flow generators and those were outperforming the market and outperforming the rest of the business and so had an impact on GM.", "Ian Abbott", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, you also talk about average selling prices and that\u2019s always a feature of the industry but if you could perhaps comment just on what you are seeing there both in the U.S. and also rest of the world.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, look, the pricing environment is pretty normal. As you know, Ian, about two years ago we stopped giving the quarterly update on year-on-year ASP adjustments, but it's really back to a pretty normal level. 18 or 20 months ago there was a bit of a step change but we are back to a pretty normal level on pricing. Another factor on GM that I didn't talk about was the acquisition of Inova which again a great product portable oxygen concentrators but closer to flow generator profit margin. And so there was two months of the three months of the quarter that we had sold Inova which had an impact on GM as well, but average prices are in a pretty stable environment both in the U.S. and in Europe.", "Ian Abbott", "Great. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Ian.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor from Barclays is on the line with a question.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand the total impact of the various acquisitions in the quarter and any help with which pieces are going where; I\u2019m trying to determine what they contributed versus what you are doing with the AirSense platform.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, that is a good question, Matt. Thanks. That will allow us to talk to organic growth and some of the acquisition growth. So as I mentioned just earlier, we had two months of Inova included in the quarter. We also had a full quarter of Curative, our acquisition in China. So when you combine the two months of Inova and the three months of Curative, it probably together contributed around 2% to global growth, so our 9% constant currency global growth was 7% organic and 2% acquisition driven. Those are broad estimates. Brett, do you want to provide any further color on that? Is that approximately right?", "Brett Sandercock", "That\u2019s spot on, Mick. It contributed around 2% to revenue growth this quarter.", "Matt Taylor", "How intuitive is in both categories outside the U.S. and Inova is just [indiscernible]?", "Mick Farrell", "Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, yes. Okay, thanks a lot, very helpful.", "Mick Farrell", "Thank you, Matt.", "Operator", "Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on the line with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Sure, thanks very much. Could I just borrow down a little bit more there and sort of understand if we look at the U.S. flow generator growth with device growth 15%, just within that number what was organically acquired with the Inova?", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, thanks for the question Andrew. We really don\u2019t want to sort of because we do give that sort of matrix of detail now within Americas and EMEA and APAC within flow gens and masks. We don\u2019t want to break out the organic versus acquisition debt all the way down the matrix. I can tell you at a high level that the core growth, if we say the market is growing at mid-to high single digits in the sleep apnea markets if you like, we well outperformed that but I don't want to break the 15 out down by basis points because I think that starts to get us into a level of granularity that we just do not get from our competitors on public conference calls and it doesn\u2019t really help our shareholders and driving long-term value but I appreciate the question.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Okay. So if market is 6% to 8%, you are tracking above that level on your flow gens?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, we are significantly above that.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Great, that's perfect. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Margaret Kaczor with William Blair is on the line with a question.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Good afternoon, everyone. Good morning, Brett. The first question maybe is on the U. S. side, obviously, we've seen some good durables strength you just talked about it, but you guys are facing a tougher comp as we go into the next few quarters. So, do you envision being able to keep up that double-digit range and just talk about the overall durability of the business. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, good question Margaret. Look, we do want to go into too much. We don\u2019t give guidance. We don't want to go into too much detail. But look at a very high level, we think the Air Solutions Platform and what it has created \u2013 the ecosystem it has created is provided such value for our customers and not just the HME customers, but also for patients. We have 900 patients every day signing up to a patient application called myAir. So the value for the ecosystem is just so strong that we see that demand continuing. But we are realistic; we know that there are some big comps particularly on flow generators and particularly in the Americas for Q4 and Q1, but we have a very strong value proposition on that. Jim Hollingshead, President of the Americas, do want to give any further color on that?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Sure. Thanks for the question, Margaret. We are seeing very robust growth in the flow gen platforms because of the solutions adoption. The AirSense and AirCurve 10 platforms are both superior products to anything on the market just as a flow generator to begin with, but we are seeing a lot of uptake of our solutions across many, many of our customers and we think that\u2019s driving the persistent growth. We feel very confident in that.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Okay, great. And then just to keep pushing on that a little bit, how is the sales process may be changed with your acquisition of Brightree, I know it\u2019s kind of early days, but are you seeing your sales guys go into these accounts and sell Brightree, Inova and sleep apnea [ph] in one transaction and how should we expect that go-to-market strategy to change in year one, two and so on? Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, thanks, Margaret. Well, there is a lot of aspects to that question. I will let Jim provide a little more color if it makes sense on the go-to-market, but at a high level what we are doing with the Inova acquisition, which we had two months as said of close of that in the quarter is we are working very carefully with our territory managers and our region managers and some specialists from the Inova team on portable oxygen concentrators. In a similar way that we have specialist on ventilation and other respiratory care products, we will have specialist sales force on portable oxygen concentrators. But the full portfolio is available to our whole sales team.", "And so what we really like to provide is a portfolio of solutions to our customers. There are different selling methodologies and selling cloud-based software that requires an infrastructure investment upfront and signing long-term contract such as Brightree interaction versus providing, say, faster turnaround items such as patient interface systems and masks. However, we have a good portfolio of people in our sales force that can do both the transactional and the long-term strategic sales as part of that. Jim, do you want to provide any further color on the go-to-market for the Brightree and Inova?", "Jim Hollingshead", "I will comment, may not be further color, I will just say it\u2019s work in progress. We\u2019re a little bit further along with the planning for Inova Labs and how we integrate that. Brightree will continue to be a separate subsidiary, but you can imagine we really just closed both of those acquisitions, so we are working on that plan right now, Margaret.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Margaret.", "Operator", "Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.", "Will Dunlop", "Thanks. Good morning. You\u2019ve given the contribution of acquisition to sales; are you able to give the contribution to profits or EBIT?", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks for the question. We really don\u2019t want to drill down through the whole P&L. With regard to that, we will have an SEC document that we will provide before the end of the fiscal year. So this quarter that will outline the Brightree business in quite some detail, so you will see that in the coming months. But we really don\u2019t want to sort of get into a quarterly reporting where we break down all the way through the P&L for these three acquisitions, but we are happy to provide that color at the top line that it is around 2% of global growth, so 9% total growth, 7% organic and 2% acquisition driven.", "Will Dunlop", "Okay, thank you. And are you just able to give some color around what your U. S. customers are asking for in terms of price given that we are heading into the implementation of round two [indiscernible] and full round three price reduction as of July 1?", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, I will hand to Jim Hollingshead; he is closest to the U. S. business line.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yeah, we\u2019ve been having those conversations for months with customers. I think that this year is a little bit different from FY2014 when CB2 hit for the first time. So the vast majority of our customers have anticipated what\u2019s coming and we\u2019ve been having pricing conversations with them for months. And so, this does hit their business and we are continuing to have the normal pricing conversations in that context.", "Will Dunlop", "Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Will.", "Operator", "Mike Matson from Needham & Company is online with a question.", "Mike Matson", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to ask about Brightree. I know there has been concern amongst the HME customer base around the data that you guys have access to through their cloud-based system, so I was just wondering, one, do you think that\u2019s a risk, that they only need some of those customers and then they might choose to move to a different software provider? And two, is there a way that you can try to wall off that data and convince them that you are not going to use that to try to help your flow generator and masks sales?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Mike. The Brightree acquisition is really \u2013 when you think about it, it\u2019s a huge investment that ResMed made, around 10% of our market cap we invested, $800 million in our HME customers in software that is purely focused on having cloud-based software applications that take laborious tasks like revenue cycle management, like inventory management, like clinical protocol management and physician signature management and automate those. And so, we think that instead of being owned by a venture capital firm being owned by a player who has a long-term 27-year history in its industry and plan to invest for the next 27 years in providing home medical equipment, but it's a really positive sign for our customers that it\u2019s got strong financial backing and someone who really cares about it.", "We are excited about the hospice and we're excited about home health because those are the new channels that the Brightree acquisition brings. Have a lot of sleep disorder breathing and a lot of COPD and neuromuscular disease patients, so that we can roll back in to our HME customers. But look I got to tell you, I haven\u2019t had as many conversations with Jim, but I have out of these last 2.5 plus months since we announced this acquisition been in a number of dinners and conversations with customers where I express what our goals are and what our plans are with Brightree and how we are going to invest to not only improve good quality to great quality, but ensure that we have even more efficiencies for them as a whole channel and our investment is to make sure more and more sleep apnea patients are able to be served by them has been received very positively. But, Jim, do want to talk a little bit more to the specifics of Mike\u2019s question?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yeah, sure, it's a great question and we have had that question from customers, right. And I will say as a blanket statement to start, we are absolutely committed to putting in place appropriate protection for our customers\u2019 business sensitive information. It\u2019s very important to us that we do that, that\u2019s how we work with our customers in general and that\u2019s how we are as a company and so we are completely committed to that. But if I go broader and just say about the reaction of customers in the market, it has been more than two months since we announced that acquisition. And generally speaking, I think that the response from our customers has been very positive. And I think you can see in the Q3 results that if anything it\u2019s impacted the business positively.", "Mike Matson", "All right. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the international business, at 3% growth, I mean what do you think those markets are growing at, do you think you are gaining or losing share in those markets? And just comment on the air solutions, it\u2019s doing really well in the U.S., but do you think it is as appealing to those international customers?", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, good question, Mark. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Rob Douglas", "Yeah, thanks, Mike. In all of our other countries around the world, we view them as a portfolio; they are all running on different dynamics. And some are growing strongly at various times and other ones have challenging periods. Across the board, we are seeing \u2013 we talk about the mid-single market growth, mid-single digits market growth, and we believe that we are very much holding our own in that market growth and going well.", "The air solutions dynamic is quite different in different countries and every country has own major drivers. Some things are always the same, patients are always interested in their information and anything we can provide to them that helps them use the equipment and stay on using equipment that improves their outcome is useful. And we are seeing that in all of those markets. In other markets, we have to deal with specific issues, specific privacy concerns in Europe, language concerns in Japan, for example, and all of those things we\u2019ve got going well and we are on, I guess, it\u2019s slower than the U.S. but a very solid implementation plan through all of those countries to roll air solutions out. It\u2019s an ongoing program for us.", "Mike Matson", "All right, thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Mick.", "Operator", "Matth O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with question.", "J.P. Peltier", "This is actually J.P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess in terms of going back to the revenue break down between flow generator and masks, I mean you\u2019ve been able to grow flow generators faster than masks for the past few quarters and arguably tougher comps, so I\u2019m just trying to drill in on the mask side of the business, is there anything going on from a competitive dynamic or from a pricing headwind perspective that is making performance there challenging?", "Mick Farrell", "Look, don't judge the outperformance of our flow generators to make our masks look bad. I mean the Americas flow generator performance at 16% year-on-year provided on a constant currency basis was just incredible and driven by, as Rob said, a very fast take up a air solutions in these last 18 months, it\u2019s a longer haul for some of those other 99 countries we do business in. The 10% year-on-year constant currency growth in masks and accessories I think is exceptional. And certainly keeping share and probably taking share in some categories.", "Look, having said that, we are in a competitive game and the competitive game is across the board. We changed the basis of competition in flow generators, which has allowed us to outperform in that category. Will we and can we continue to change the game and bring increasing and great innovation to our mask platform? Well, we\u2019ve been doing it for 27 years and we plan to do it for the next 27 years. So the answer to that is yes. We put 7% of our revenues approximately into research and development, a very good chunk of that goes into mask innovation, plastic science, anthropometric, understanding what patients need now and in the future. And I got to tell you I am really excited about the pipeline of masks and I think that the team did well in that in Q3, but we can always do better.", "Sure just a follow-up, on the competitive that you alluded to what is in the feedback the year-over-year sales reps effort on this treat from the Phillips launch?", "J.P. Peltier", "Sure. And just a follow-up on the competitive dynamics you alluded to. What is in the feedback that you\u2019ve heard or your sales have heard on the street from Philips-Medtronic generator launch?", "Mick Farrell", "You know, look, I really don't like to sort of throw a model, get involved in sort of a competitor back and forth on these conference call J.P. All I will say is that look our device, and it\u2019s really our solution, the air solutions platform has incredible advantages. We take great cost out of the system, we provide such value for our customers and customers are using a broad sense. The customer is the patient obviously but it\u2019s also the provider, the DME, it is also payers and other folks beyond. And the value we are able to do by linking up with EMR and EHR systems in a closed payer-provider network or a government run insurance in Western Europe network or \u2013 and the data we\u2019re able to provide, patients means the strong demand for our product. And so I do think we\u2019ve got a winning value proposition.", "I think it\u2019s a very sustainable competitive advantage. But having said that, we believe in productive paranoia. And as I was saying earlier, we innovate our cloud-based systems on a regular basis. Weekly and monthly upgraded to these to make sure we keep those is a finely oiled machine here and that\u2019s our goal in this space. But look there is always competition. We love competition. What we love doing is really providing value to customers and customers choosing our products and solutions because of that.", "J.P. Peltier", "Great, thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, J.P.", "Operator", "Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.", "Saul Hadassin", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mick, maybe a question for you. I think in the past you\u2019ve talked to a mask lifecycle of around 1.5, maybe 2 years, I just want to check if that\u2019s still correct, because you are up the T\u2019s I think since the range of the masks were launched. And I'm just wondering where we are in terms of that launch cycle, how should we be expecting some new masks anytime soon?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Saul. Yeah, well, I mean, I was talking about the healthcare informatics lifecycle of being every couple of months with an upgrade. Mask systems \u2013 it depends on the full face, the nasal, the pillows and the technologies you are using. The AirFit range has been incredibly successful. The P10 mask, which is a nasal pillows mask, which I personally use, is the best mask on the planet for nasal pillows and our F10 remains clearly a world leading mask. And the N10, I think it's a very good mask, I think look we can always do better. And every time we release a product we are looking to do better. You know, Saul, that we don\u2019t go into the specifics of our roadmap, but if you are asking me are there are exciting masks in the horizon? Of course, there are. How far is that horizon now? Well, I can\u2019t go into details on that. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to from a competitive dynamic front given the public nature of this call.", "Saul Hadassin", "Fair enough. And just to sneak one more in for Brett, just regarding operating cash flow, another quarter of very strong right there, I think, for the nine months it\u2019s up almost 40% with essentially flat non-GAAP earnings, just wondering what you\u2019ve changed there in terms of that working capital management that has benefited that line?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. Thanks, Saul. The cash flow has been very strong for the business and has been quite sustained over the three quarters as you noted. So we're really pleased with that. If you look at the big one there is probably around inventory where we\u2019ve managed to reduce that over time. There's a lot with the essence growth thing, so strong over the period. I think now we\u2019ve had time to stabilize that and adjust somewhat. So we really started tune inventory levels and I think that sort of \u2013 its underlying \u2013 the strong underlying earnings has played a part for sure and then really turning that inventory, I think, it\u2019s just sort of underpin and deliver some stronger cash flow through those quarters. That's probably bring the biggest impact.", "Saul Hadassin", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on the line with a question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on Brightree and I think you touched on it earlier. So forgive me if I'm overlapping me here a bit, but maybe just to expand a little bit on the strategy there, how long do you think it will take to fully integrate Brightree and sort of what synergies do you expect particularly in the HME, DME channel in the U. S. in terms of just install base on the Brightree side? Is there an opportunity to sort of up sell Brightree solutions into the existing ResMed install base?", "Mick Farrell", "Well, thanks for the question, Anthony. Clearly the revenue and EBITDA is an immediate integration right. So, we get a nice addition of $113 million growing at strong levels on the top line and north of $43 million of EBITDA growing strong double-digits as well, so that was integrated immediately. In terms of the operating integration, as Jim said earlier, we will run Brightree as a subsidiary that has clearly separation of some data to make sure that our teams perform everything appropriately.", "The synergies with customers are that clearly we have customers who purchase our products and will also purchase Brightree solutions. So there will be a clear coordination between our sales force, but as Jim said, we closed the acquisition on April 4, and it is now April 26, we haven\u2019t fully integrated our go-to-market in the first 22 days, but we do have a 91-83-60 [ph] plan here and will be able to provide, probably on this call over the coming fourth quarters, further and further integrations including obviously financial integration starting Q4 those numbers rolling in, but then the go-to-market integration over the coming four quarters.", "Anthony Petrone", "And then, just one follow-up there and hop back in, but just \u2013 again should we assume that this is traditional software margin structure, where it should be margin accretive overall to the business or will that take some time to sort of play out?", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, Anthony. It will be immediately gross margin accretive and I think Brett in his prepared remarks talked about 70 to 100 basis points of positive contribution is likely in Q4 from including of the Brightree \u2013 the Brightree financials. So, it is a really good immediately accretive on top line and on GM.", "Anthony Petrone", "Got it. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Anthony. ", "Operator", "Victor Windeyer from Citi is on the line with a question.", "Victor Windeyer", "Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to try it out a bit, trying to get the underlying plain growth. So you mentioned [indiscernible] I think back in the day when the trial [indiscernible] result came out, you\u2019ve had $150 million of [indiscernible] and I just want to know if you could give us any clarity on what the quarter will be year-on-year? [Indiscernible] whether it\u2019s flat sequentially now?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Victor. I\u2019ll hand it to Rob to address the European and ASV question.", "Rob Douglas", "Yeah, thanks, Victor. When we made the announcement last year, we sort of gave some indications of what we felt the impact would be. We are pretty accurate in those predictions and so we roughly standby those predictions. The impact has been more significant in Europe where we had an indication for cardiology patients versus in the U.S. where we didn\u2019t. Our team working hard on some of the other applications for ASV and Mick mentioned them earlier on. Particularly talking about on complex sleep apnea as well as on patients who are on pain medication and so we see a lot of opportunities there and those market development opportunities are underway not only emphasize in the U.S., but also in other markets around the world. And we should start to see some benefit from those activities selling through. And as Nick also said earlier, we will anniversary the announcement on May 13 and the impact that we \u2013 the short-term impact that we had after that came on fairly quickly. So we should see those activities even up from there on in.", "Victor Windeyer", "Okay. So, after you give the timing, you said 25% [indiscernible] maybe that\u2019s clearly the $40 million or something, $10 million a quarter, I mean is that roughly where it comes in, is that what you --?", "Mick Farrell", "Victor, we\u2019re not going to go into the details. You\u2019re right. That\u2019s what we side. At that time, we said it\u2019s \u2013 ASV is roughly 7% of the revenues and we thought a quarter of that might be at risk and roughly on the global numbers that\u2019s roughly in line. As Rob said, it was a bit ahead of that in Europe and Americas was not as badly affected as Europe.", "Rob Douglas ", "Thanks for your question, Victor.", "Victor Windeyer", "[Indiscernible] level we expected to grow with the applications, we are going expect that one to grow in the underlying business to come forward [indiscernible].", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, yeah, Victor, as I said earlier and Rob just said now, from May 13, we will hit the anniversary of the date of the announcement and from then the activity went pretty quickly as Rob said. So we should expect to ramp to strong positive ASV growth from that date. But really as I said in my prepared remarks, fiscal 2017 is where we are going to see the benefits of complex sleep apnea, payments medication, post traumatic stress disorder and also some other applications on CSA that are interesting in the sort of stroke patients and others. So, we\u2019ll see those going forward.", "Victor Windeyer", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Victor.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Chris Kallos from Morningstar is on the line with the question.", "Chris Kallos", "Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one on the gross margin side, the guidance of 57%, 60% does that include the margin equation from Brightree?", "Mick Farrell", "Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah, Chris. Hi, it\u2019s Brett. Yes, it does.", "Chris Kallos", "Okay. So does that suggest that without Brightree the gross margin would be sort of on the low side? So the guidance would actually be lower?", "Brett Sandercock", "I am not sure you can conclude that Chris. At the end of the day, we sort of 57% to 60% obviously Brightree will have a quite significant positive impact for us going into Q4 and then all the other factors play out as well that\u2019s come up with that guidance range. I don't think you can form a conclusion either way on what the guidance would have been in, but certainly Brightree will have a positive impact on that.", "Chris Kallos", "Great. And just a quick follow-up, on the reimbursements, you mentioned on the rebid, are there any other comments you could add to that on just reimbursement right now?", "Brett Sandercock", "No. there is nothing new in the reimbursement environment globally. So, I mean frankly everything that\u2019s been talked about in the U. S. has been projected, the government run process, so it is usually projected 12, 24, even 36 months in advance. So, there is really now news on the reimbursement plan.", "Chris Kallos", "Great. Thank you. ", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question. ", "Margaret Kaczor", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking a follow-up. Maybe the first question, just a follow-up on, we know that the ASV is obviously had an impact on the international dynamics, but do you guys have a same store growth number if you do take ASVs out of international? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. Margaret. Good follow-up, but we do not want to provide that level of detail. Rob if you can provide any color to help address Margaret's question that we want to share. ", "Rob Douglas", "No, we really do not want to break that out Margaret, but obviously with the ASV not helping some of the other underlying parts of the business, it would look better, if the ISC wasn\u2019t included in it, but it\u2019s just too commercially sensitive to break all that out.", "Brett Sandercock", "I mean the one bit of color we can provide is that ASV, and this is important as it starts to come back in 2017. It\u2019s a very margin accretive product. It's a very margin accretive product. So, as it starts to come back it will really benefit us and clearly, just hitting the 12 month mark of a headwind that\u2019s been a tough 11 months on the GM front as you guys have seen in the numbers with that as a headwind as it starts to turn mutual and become a tailwind in 2017. It can really help us, but clearly we are executing on ASV we got some really exciting applications for it, you will hear more from us on this front in the future.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Great. And then, just in terms of gross margin again, Brett maybe you can give us a little bit more perspective, you mentioned mix ASP and geographic mix, should we think of that about that third or third or third or overweight one of those categories and as ASV comes back, is that the primary driver to maybe reverse that trend on gross margins for the course sleep apnea business and over what timeframe should we expect that? Thank you. ", "Rob Douglas", "So that seven part multi-question, it\u2019s a perfect one for Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "I\u2019ll have a crack of that one. Thanks, Margaret. Look, the most significant one has definitely been product mix and that\u2019s been the biggest one and that\u2019s multiple really, obviously ASV is playing out there a little bit and playing out there as well and just a really strong outperformance in flow generators. So, it\u2019s a big thing of those - with ASV that sort of stuff dissipates certainly through Q4 and then into Q1. So that will certainly help. And then, obviously Brightree comes on boarding in Q4 as well. And then just as I mentioned earlier just depends on the trends for products mix and also geographic mix. So, even really strong outperformance in the Americas, which is positive, does have an impact on the growth margin. So, a number of factors playing out, but some of those moderate and some of kind of disappeared into FY17. So, I think that\u2019s good. I mean the important thing on that European and ASV headwind, is that that\u2019s go away and that\u2019s if you strip that out, the device number internationally would be better. So, I think that\u2019s something to look at that, I think that obviously headwind is really detracting from international and that is definitely something it\u2019s going to go away into FY17.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Thank you, guys very helpful. ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. Thanks, Margaret.", "Operator", "Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on the line with a question.", "Suraj Kalia", "Good afternoon everyone, Mick one question for you and one for Brett. Mick you give a pretty good insight into how you are going to be integrating Brightree and you're going to be helping your customers, I guess let me just belabor that point, specifically Phillips and the [well-wisher] customers. So what is the stickiness if I can use that word, for Phillips and developers staying with Brightree? In other words, do you all risk losing Phillips and Devilbiss some point in the future, how do all prevent that because that would be some portion of Brightree's revenues?", "Mick Farrell", "The revenues for Brightree come from the customers who are the HME providers and HME providers have a portfolio of products that they use. So they - our customers or the HME providers are buying from ResMed and some of the competitors that you named. So my presumption is our customers will continue to want to buy from them and would want them to use the software program that our customers are using. It is as simple as that. It is not our decision or our competitors decision it\u2019s the customers decision and the customer has to make a right decision and about the economic interests, the longer-term interest primarily with their patients and for growing business efficiently. So, we think that will play out, really we've had two or three months of this out there and playing out just fine as far as we see it. So, we're pretty excited frankly two months after the announcement and really only 22 days after the close and we're revving up to move forward.", "Suraj Kalia", "Fair enough. And Brett I know you mentioned 7% organic growth and 2% acquired on a constant currency basis and maybe I missed this, Brett since curative is primarily [U. S.] , Inova is primarily U. S. can you give us the as reported numbers for the quarter? Thank you for taking my questions. ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yeah. I think Mick talked about it earlier in terms of getting going too much into the detail on that. I think you guys - the overall number was 2% and either would be squid to devices obviously and then more spread. So, I think probably did not have some fair estimates on what kind of the impacts would be through the categories without going into too much detail on it.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour Mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell. ", "Mick Farrell", "Thank you, Andrew. And in closing, I want to welcome the Inova and Brightree teams to our global ResMed team and to thank the now almost 5000 strong team here at ResMed from around the world for their commitment to changing lives, of millions of patients with every breath. I'm very proud of what this team has accomplished not just here in Q3, but beyond in creating the world\u2019s leading tech driven medical device company. We remain laser focused our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020 by literally giving products and the gift of breath to those folks.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Laurel and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Laurel and thank you for attending ResMed\u2019s live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we summarize our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. We delivered solid global growth this quarter led by strong double-digit growth in the Americas region and high single-digit growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions. We closed the Brightree acquisition April 4. So, this is our first quarter that includes revenue and profit contribution from the Brightree suite of software-as-a-service offerings.", "For the call today, I will first review our high level financial results, I will then outline some regional highlights from our business, and then finally, I will discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. After that, I will hand the call over to Brett to walk you through our financial results in greater detail. Throughout fiscal year 2016, I have talked about ResMed\u2019s growing global leadership in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This leadership has been a catalyst for strong overall revenue growth and market beating organic revenue growth these last 12 months.", "We produced robust double-digit growth in the Americas region. These results were fueled by the ongoing success of organic masks and devices growth augmented by new software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We achieved above market growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with the highlight being double-digit growth of our flow generators in the combined EMEA and APAC group. At the bottom line, our diluted earnings per share, was $0.74 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 9% year-on-year growth. In terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew our bottom line at 20% in Q4 on a year-on-year basis. We continue to balance strong revenue growth with ongoing investments in R&D and our global focus on operating excellence. We achieved positive operating leverage in SG&A, keeping its growth well below our top line revenue growth. We are investing for the long-term future, maintaining R&D spend at around 7% of top line revenue. These R&D investments will enhance our long-term pipeline of innovation across the portfolios of sleep apnea, COPD and connected care solutions.", "Now, let me drill into some regional highlights. First, in the Americas region, we had strong sales performance in Q4 with our commercial team driving 11% growth in masks and accessories and 6% growth in devices in the Americas. This latter number was up against a hefty 53% growth comparable from last year. These robust results from the Americas team have the foundation of stable market growth. However, it really shows the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 systems, powered and catalyzed by our cloud-based Air Solutions software platform, including the U-Sleep and myAir applications. These applications are liberating data and unlocking value in terms of actionable information for HME providers and for patients, respectively. The double-digit growth for the masks and accessories category was a great result for the Americas in Q4. We expect solid masks and accessories growth as we move forward with resupply initiatives and new product launches during fiscal year 2017.", "Turning to the combined EMEA and APAC group. We had strong sales performance in these regions, resulting in 8% growth on a constant currency basis in Q4. We produced solid growth in devices in the region, especially from our sleep apnea platforms. As we discussed last quarter, the ASV growth headwind started to subside mid-Q4, and we will pass the anniversary of the tail of this impact in this current quarter, Q1 fiscal \u201817. We are clearly turning the corner in ASV, and we continue to see exciting opportunities ahead for ASV therapy, particularly for patients with central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea, pain management medication and posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD. We are excited to get back to growth on a trajectory for this really innovative, beneficial and high-margin therapy.", "Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 strategy. We have made good progress in global leadership for connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have now incorporated into our P&L high-quality, recurring software-as-a-service revenue from Brightree. We will continue to invest in our portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions to help our HME customers become even more efficient and to help them free up cash flow for even better patient care.", "We recently announced a new CEO and a new COO for Brightree. Matt Mellott is the new CEO and Bobby Ghoshal is the new COO. Matt\u2019s experience in successfully building and running a multi-state HME that used Brightree as an integral part of that business sets him up as a strong and capable leader for Brightree. Bobby\u2019s experience in running ResMed\u2019s IT team for the Americas sets him up to be a great operating partner together with Matt. So Matt and Bobby, together with the Brightree leadership team, will guide the development and ongoing integration of the Brightree suite of software solutions within and as a part of the Air Solutions platform offerings.", "The goal is clear to provide enhanced value for HME partners, for physicians, for payers and for patients. With our HME channel partners, our current connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency. They are eliminating waste, increasing medical device adherence and improving patient outcomes. We intend to continue to grow our connected care solutions in COPD as well as other chronic care applications as we move forward. This strategic foundation of connected care is an integral part of our current and our future success.", "Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of our Three Horizons and then hand over to Brett, and then we\u2019ll head on to Q&A. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we have seen strong, sustained growth since the launch of the Air Solutions platform. While many companies are talking about connected care and digital health, we have executed in connected care, and we lead the market with well over 2 million, 100% cloud-connected medical devices, sending data to the cloud every day. This is more than double the nearest competitor. We also have over 900 patients each day signing up for our patient engagement application called myAir.", "Air Solutions not only has millions and millions of patients, it is also connected through APIs to hospital and physician managed electronic medical record systems that allow patients to share data with their caregivers. We are in mile 1 of a marathon of population health management and health care analytics. Through this ecosystem, we are liberating data that we turn into actionable information for patients, physicians, providers and for payers.", "At ResMed, we are a company that is clearly founded on scientific principles of research. During the quarter, Dr. Dennis Hwang of Kaiser Permanente presented results from a large prospective randomized controlled trial at the SLEEP meeting in Denver, Colorado. The Kaiser Permanente study randomized 1,455 patients, and its conclusion was that the use of ResMed\u2019s cloud based algorithm called U-Sleep produced a 21% relative increase in sleep habit adherence. Dr. Hwang was quoted as saying the following: anything that significantly increases CPAP use in the first 90 days is a big deal. That initial period is crucial for patients to embrace CPAP to treat their sleep apnea, which is linked to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes and other serious conditions. Tools like U-Sleep hold a lot of promise for patients on CPAP and the clinicians who treat them. We think that\u2019s a great quote.", "We believe that U-Sleep and the broader Air Solutions platform is a huge value to Kaiser Permanente as well as other payer provider models in the U.S. and around the world, including ACOs, IDNs and many government run payer provider models as they look for ways to take better care of patients and essentially to keep their patients out of high cost hospitals and to treat them with high quality and great care in the concerns of their own home.", "With the close of the Brightree acquisition in Q4, we have augmented Air Solutions to create an even stronger end-to-end value proposition for HME customers. We will continue to help our HME partners drive even more efficiencies in their businesses and also continue to invest in market development of new channels for the software-as-a-service offerings of Brightree in home health, home nursing as well as in the hospice channel. Watch this space. In the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, we have continued the integration process at Inova, which is the portable oxygen concentrator company we acquired in Q3. We have completed the integration of our commercial sales and marketing teams and we are now leveraging our global manufacturing, quality and product development expertise to take Inova to the next level.", "We clearly have opportunities to grow revenue by selling POCs through our global market channels and we will prioritize the 100 countries where we sell so as to maximize physician, provider and patient value throughout fiscal year 2017 and beyond. We will create next generation Inova products that provide not only a step up in quality, but also to leverage our global connected care leadership in this space. The strategy is to leverage connected care solutions for COPD across a broad portfolio of offerings, including life support ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, and now portable oxygen concentrators. This spectrum of respiratory care products will help patients with neuromuscular diseases like ALS as well as normocapnic COPD and hypercapnic COPD patients. With COPD being the number three cause of death in the Western world and the number two cause of re-hospitalization in the West, we know connected care will play a big role in the future.", "This quarter, we announced that we are adding a ResMed communication module, essentially a wireless communication module, to our life support ventilator, Astral. There will be more to come on this front. Along with our product strategies in this space, we are driving market channel strategies. In Q4, we announced a group purchasing organization, or GPO contract, to enable 3,600 member hospitals and 120,000 other providers to purchase and use ResMed\u2019s best-in-class respiratory care products and services as patients move from the hospital to in-home care. As I noted just a moment ago, there will be more to come on this front as we continue to execute against this part of our strategy. Our third horizon of growth, includes a robust portfolio of long-term opportunities in new markets, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, asthma, chronic disease management as well as sleep health and sleep wellness.", "During the quarter, clinical trial results from the CAT-HF trial were presented at the annual Heart Failure Congress at the European Society of Cardiology or ESC. The overall CAT-HF study results were neutral. However, a pre-specified subgroup of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients showed a clinically and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint for this study was a combined measure of mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of the patient. This study, CAT-HF, is the first study globally to show that addressing sleep disordered breathing with Adaptive Servo-Ventilation may improve cardiovascular outcomes, heart outcomes for people with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. We expect full publication of the CAT-HF study shortly and we are very excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization and re-hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally.", "Returning to our financial results, we have been able to put our balance sheet to work this fiscal year. We have invested $1 billion into high quality acquisitions that clearly drive us towards our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. You will see us laser focused on ensuring we get return on capital for these investments. Our Board has increased the dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our long-term strategy and our ability to drive ongoing cash flow from the business. Given our significant capital deployment this year, we believe it is prudent to continue to temporarily suspend our share repurchase program. It is important to note that we reserve the right to resume the share buyback program at any time in the future as conditions warrant.", "Let me close with this. In fiscal year 2016, we established ourselves as the global leader in digital health and connected care for respiratory medicine. This is only strengthened by our acquisition of Brightree. We have added essential building blocks for our global cardio respiratory care strategy, particularly in connected care for COPD. We remain excited as we build the road ahead for our industry, for our partners and most importantly, for millions and millions of patients around the world.", "With that, I will hand the call over to Brett, who is in Sydney for his comments, over to you, Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Great. Thanks Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our acquisition this fiscal year. As Mick noted, we had a solid finish to the year. Group revenue for the June quarter was $518.6 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 15%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 8% over the prior year quarter and excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior year quarter.", "Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $295.6 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pac totaled $194.1 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific also increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $161 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $134.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pac, device sales were $133.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%. Masks and other sales were $60.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, also an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior year quarter.", "I would now like to provide some additional information about the Brightree revenue contribution. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $28.9 million. On a pro forma full quarter basis, Brightree\u2019s revenue would have been $32.2 million. This represents the most relevant measure of Brightree\u2019s fourth quarter revenue run rate. The difference in our reported revenue and pro forma revenue is related to two items. First, a one-time $2.3 million fair value adjustment to Brightree\u2019s deferred revenue balances required under U.S. GAAP purchase accounting rules and second, the pro forma revenue of $32.2 million for the quarter includes a few days revenue that was not included in reported revenue due to the close of the Brightree acquisition on April 4. As it relates to acquisitions, during the quarter we also incurred $1.9 million in acquisition and integration related expenses associated with the Inova and Brightree acquisition.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjusted for the impact of acquisition and integration expenses associated with our acquisitions of Brightree and Inova, the amortization of acquired intangibles, the Brightree acquisition of one-time deferred revenue fair value adjustment, the SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of accounting standard ASU 2016-09. In the prior year comparable, that excludes the SERVE-HF accrual, amortization of acquired intangibles and the donation for UCSD and the ResMed Foundation. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.", "Our non-GAAP gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margins declined by 20 basis points, reflecting typical declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix, essentially offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, largely attributable to the Brightree acquisition and a more consistent product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margins to continue to be in a range of 57% to 60% for fiscal year 2017.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $133.9 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.8% compared to 27.2% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 26% to 27% for fiscal year 2017.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 24%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6% compared to the year ago figure of 6.3%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for fiscal year 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $12.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $10.5 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.6 million.", "Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $135.1 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $104.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $83.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.74, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.59. Overall, foreign exchange movements positively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 per share, reflecting the favorable impact from the weaker Australian dollar.", "During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard that was issued in the U.S. called ASU 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. As a result of adopting this standard, we have recognized the full year tax benefit of $11.2 million and this provided us with an opportunity to increase our foreign cash repatriation to the U.S. with the additional tax expense largely offsetting the tax benefit. With this adoption and the increase in cash repatriation, our full year effective tax rate remained relatively consistent at 19.8% compared to the prior year tax rate of 19%. On a non-GAAP basis, we have reflected full year tax benefit from the adoption of this standard within our tax expense for the fourth quarter, resulting in non-GAAP effective tax rate of 22%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%.", "Cash flow from operations was $143 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings and an improvement in net working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $27 million. For fiscal year 2016, we generated record operating cash flow of $547.9 million, an increase of 43% over the prior fiscal year. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. Consequently, we did not repurchase any shares during the June quarter, however we may at any time elect to reinitiate the share repurchase program. At the end of June, we had approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $444 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains modestly geared and very strong. At June 30, total assets were $3.3 billion, and net equity was $1.7 billion.", "And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Laurel, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Thanks very much for taking my question. I was just wondering if you are willing to tell us something about your new mask range, we have seen the 510(k) there and perhaps if you are not willing go into too much detail whether you are willing to talk about the opportunity to evolve the business model with the AirSense 10 and the connectivity piece?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Andrew. You are right in your caveat around the question, but we \u2013 for competitive reasons, we don\u2019t think it benefits shareholder value to go into the details of product timing and product launches. But as you noted, there is some activity there in 510(k)s and we do plan to launch at least one new mask before the end of the calendar year and that\u2019s all the information I will give on that. But in terms of your second part of your question, which was about connectivity and how we can use the fantastic ecosystem of connectivity that we have and the installed base of 2 million cloud-connected medical devices to interact with patients and the myAir application, where patients are connected directly to the cloud, we think it\u2019s great to liberate these data and then to provide actionable information to patients. We think patients should know how long they have had their mask and when it\u2019s time to replace their mask and we are seeing patients really engage in that. So we do think there is a strong link to that. And I think if you look at this quarter, where we saw 11% growth in masks and accessories in the Americas, clearly we have patients engaging on that front, more to come on new products and more to come on engaging patients over fiscal year \u201817.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Thanks very much.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Andrew.", "Operator", "Next online, we have Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you very much for taking the questions. A couple of things, Australian dollar has been up and down a little bit, but mostly down, how do we think about that impact for next year\u2019s gross margins?", "Mick Farrell", "I will hand that question over to Brett Sandercock, our CFO.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Thanks Joanne. Yes. If you looked at it sort of year-on-year sort of Q4, we did see some, a little bit of benefit from FX in particular the Aussie. Going forward into FY \u201817, we have seen more recently, I guess that\u2019s sort of bit of an up-tick in Australian dollar, it strengthened a little bit against the U.S. dollar. So in that context if you look at it sequentially into Q1, that\u2019s probably around a 50 basis point headwind for us on the gross margin there, at least in this kind of the near-term. Longer term I guess, it depends where the Aussie dollar goes, but short-term, probably a little bit of a headwind, but you would have to think longer term, it should be still be beneficial for us with the Aussie, but it has strengthened recently and we really don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to go.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay. And can you just take a bigger step back and talk about the sleep apnea landscape, how it may be changing competitively, one of your comments talked about some pressure on average selling prices, so anything as it relates to pricing or products would be appreciated? Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. Thanks Joanne. Well, the whole sleep industry landscape has changed fundamentally, I would say in these last 18 months since we launched, 18-plus months since we launched, approaching 24 months since we launched Air Solutions. And the basis of competition in the space is now changed to be not only do the devices have to be quieter, smaller, more comfortable, but they also have to be more connected. And we think that connectivity has really changed the space. It\u2019s meant that we are able to take waste out to increase adherence of patients and to remove some of the inefficient steps in the value chain and therefore extract some value for our partners our HME partners, our patient partners, our physician partners and also ourselves out of that. And so there is some mitigation of some of the historic price impacts. We don\u2019t go into details on that, but at a high level, I think that shift to value from price discussions has been a really beneficial one for us and our partners and the whole industry in general.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great. My first one will be for Brett, just some of the moving parts on the tax line and maybe can you walk us through the benefit of the ASU, but also the additional tax expense that you incurred from the repatriation of foreign cash and just how much foreign cash was repatriated in the quarter?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I will give you a sense. So we did adopt that standard and what we did, I guess is we took that opportunity to increase cash repatriation and the tax expense associated with that largely offset that benefit. So you saw in our full year tax rate, it was pretty consistent with what we saw last year. To give you an idea on the repatriation, if you look at \u2013 we basically repatriated an additional $60 million this year compared to what we did last year, so quite significant for us. So we felt that, that was the best thing to do and just take the opportunity, I guess that would be implementation of the standard. So overall, if you kind of looked at our overall full year tax rate and tax rates going forward, I think it will continue to be pretty consistent.", "Anthony Petrone", "Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe my follow-up would just be back on pricing a bit and maybe just a little bit more details on underlying pricing in sleep, specifically it relates to the competitive landscape, we did some checks earlier in the quarter and our understanding is Respironics came in with more of a price discount since the beginning of the year and additionally, we are hearing 3B Medical is sort of out there with more aggressive pricing, so any comments there would be helpful? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Anthony. We don\u2019t go into particular details about competitor A or competitor B. I will reiterate what I said before a little bit and I will maybe give to Jim Hollingshead, our President, Americas, to give a little more color and detail around the U.S. environment. But at a high level, I think the shift to value and the shift to talk about how much data you are extracting from devices, how you are getting that data into my customer, who for our customer, their customer is either the hospital or the physician or even the payer. And by providing those data, we are extracting value for their customer and their customers\u2019 customer. So you are sort of changing the conversation from a pure price one to a value one. And if your box is X dollars cheaper, but the value provided is X plus, then the discussion goes back to the value side of it. But with that as a prelude, Jim any further comments on pricing?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Sure. I think everybody is aware that the big driver of pricing in the U.S. market has been ongoing Medicare changes to reimbursement and that\u2019s pressure that the market has been under for several months through the competitive bidding process. I think our results in Q4 show that our Air Solutions offers or our AirSense and AirCurve devices coupled with our software platforms create a lot of value. So we \u2013 our revenue grew against a huge Q4 comp last year precisely because we have really shifted, as Mick said just earlier, we have really shifted the nature of what we are doing with our HME customers to allow them to create more value out of their business. So our offerings allow them to increase their revenue and cut their operating costs and that\u2019s why our offerings have held up so well over the course of the year and continue to maintain share and volume growth.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Anthony.", "Operator", "Next, we have Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Sean Laaman", "Thank you, operator. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just a question on Brightree, you have owned it for one quarter now, I don\u2019t know Mick, if you could give us a sense on the retention of existing customers and the uptake of new ones, just some commentary around there to give us something to work with would be fantastic?", "Mick Farrell", "Sure Sean. Thanks for the question. Yes. So we are 90-days plus into the close of Brightree and beyond that from the announcement. And I can tell you these first three months or four months have been a really smooth transition. We have seen great contributions from Dave Cormack, the CEO, in this transition and the new appointment of Matt Mellott as the CEO. And apart of the \u2013 directly after the announcement, which was four months or five months ago that we announced the acquisition, there was a series of phone calls and I might hand it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the details. But Jim Hollingshead, who runs our Americas, and Raj Sodhi, who runs our global \u2013 is the President of our global business unit for healthcare informatics, along with Dave Cormack called all the top customers and individually spoke to them both in our core HME space and in the Brightree space and had really good discussions with them about what we were trying to do with this acquisition, which is help them and reinvest with them to take costs and waste out and to improve patient adherence and have better flow of data through the industry and extract value for all the partners. The conversations I had, which were with a small subset of those customers were very positive and we have seen very good customer retention. In fact no significant change in customer retention pre or post the announcement or the close of the acquisition on both the core business and on Brightree. But Jim, you were involved in a lot more of those calls, do you want to provide some more color for Sean?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Sure. Thanks Mick. Sean, we have had by and large, very favorable responses from customers, whether they were individual customers on both sides, whether ResMed customer or Brightree customer or whether they were shared customers and there are several hundred shared customers out in the world. Initially, we had terrific conversations with customers and I think that the response has held up over time. We have maintained virtually all of our customer relationships with both businesses and any concerns that customers had about how the two units work together have been, I think have been effectively addressed both by the fact that we have kept Brightree operating as a separate commercial unit, separate sales force, etcetera and just in conversations that we have had. If I just go back quickly to one of the rationales for the acquisition was we were already working together out in the world making our customers business process is more streamlined. So we had data connections that were allowing an HME \u2013 so for example, in sleep, if you set up a patient on a ResMed flow gen, you could import all of the same data into the Brightree application and will go straight into our compliance applications with the click of a button. That kind of labor savings made a big difference. And I think customers see what we are trying to do, which is to extend our health informatics offering from the therapy into their back-office operations and just continue to add value by taking out costs and streamlining their business. And I think the customer response has by and large been very, very favorable.", "Sean Laaman", "Great. Thank you, Jim. And just one quick follow-up, is there any reason for perhaps seasonality in the revenue for Brightree?", "Mick Farrell", "Why don\u2019t I hand that over to Brett?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Thanks Mick. Yes. Sean, that \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s very much a subscription model. So you would certainly, from that perspective, you certainly get much less seasonality. So it\u2019s less of an impact than it would be, for example, for our kind of core existing business, so less seasonality due to the subscription model.", "Sean Laaman", "As I hope, Brett. Thank you. And thank you Mick. And that\u2019s all the questions I have.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks a lot Sean.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ben Andrew", "Good afternoon. I guess maybe a question for Brett to try to be direct, can you give us a sense of what the tax hit was for the $60 million of extra repatriation and because you keep saying largely offset, but can you be more precise?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. I mean well, to that extent it did largely offset that side, so a slightly smaller number, but not \u2013 it\u2019s around that number.", "Ben Andrew", "So very close to the actual incremental...", "Brett Sandercock", "It\u2019s around that sort of $9 million, $10 million mark on the repatriation.", "Ben Andrew", "Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s very helpful, Brett. And I guess the second question for me, as we look at the Brightree revenues, the $32.2 million, is \u2013 what growth rate does that represent year-over-year and how do you think about the sustainability of that growth rate or what should we be looking for, for the business in the next balance of the fiscal year?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. Thanks Ben. It\u2019s Mick here. One of the beauties of recurring software-as-a-service business model that Brightree has established over these last 7 years, 8 years, 9 years since they have been in business is that it\u2019s 80, 90-plus percent recurring revenue. And so you see a really steady flow, to Sean\u2019s question, proves a really steady flow, not much seasonality and sort of building up of per customer, per user, per member, per month, if you like, per user per month type of revenue models and they build up over time. We have seen really solid double-digit growth in Brightree year-on-year to get to where they are now and we expect to continue to do that. We really like the Brightree model. We really like what value it provides in the core business, which is its HME channel and partnership business. One of the upsides I alluded to in the prepared remarks, but I think related to your question there about growth and future growth is home nursing, home health and hospice channels, these two \u2013 as our population ages in the West and it\u2019s particularly focused on the U.S. market for this, there are some really exciting software-as-a-service revenue models, including iPad applications for home nurses directly entering data in the home that goes directly to the cloud, efficiency savings that are well ahead of the competition and really value that we can help extract for us and from new channel partners. And there is an upside for us and that there may be a large chunk of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD and untreated sleep apnea and COPD amongst those two channels. So there is sort two levels of upside. One is the core business is software-as-a-service and Brightree revenue in those two new channels, but secondly identifying patients for our core business in sleep apnea and our growing business in COPD.", "Ben Andrew", "Great. And just to be again direct Mick, is that mid-teens growth for Brightree or is it lower than that, higher than that? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. It\u2019s going to be around that mid-teens number. Brett, you want to go into any further detail on that or are we good with that?", "Brett Sandercock", "No, that\u2019s right, Mick. It\u2019s definitely tracking along mid-teens.", "Ben Andrew", "Thanks guys.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks a lot Ben.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Saul Hadassin with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Saul Hadassin", "Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Mick, maybe just one question, I wonder if you could talk to what you see as an industry growth rate, you have mentioned this in the past on previous quarters, where you think the industry is growing maybe in the U.S. and then rest of the world, just in a sense are you going ahead of markets, what do you \u2013 where do you see industry growth rates across the two key regions that you participate in? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. Look \u2013 thanks for the question, Saul. We think the market growth rate for the markets that we play in is in that mid to high single-digits revenue range globally. And so we think hitting that 8% constant currency growth in EMEA and APAC we are slightly ahead of market growth there. We think we took some share in that sort of combined sleep and respiratory care space. And if you look at excluding Brightree, the core Americas business, excluding Brightree grew at 8% as well. And so again, I would say we are taking some share there, not a huge amount of share, but taking some share and against a very tough comparable from Q4 last year. We think that\u2019s a pretty good performance. And as we look forward, that\u2019s our goal, right. We don\u2019t accept market growth. We like to drive market growth. We like to have innovations that create opportunities for us to grow ahead of the curve and so we don\u2019t give guidance as you know, but we see the market growing in that mid to high single-digits and we like to meet or beat on a regular basis.", "Saul Hadassin", "Alright. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Saul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Abbott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ian Abbott", "Hi guys. Good morning. One thing, when you speak to DMEs, one of their focuses is on re-supply and they are focusing on trying to ship more accessories with masks and I am just wondering, from your perspective, how far do you think there is to go on this. And secondly, with your solutions with connectivity, how is that helping them?", "Mick Farrell", "So good question Ian, I will do the first part and then hand over to Jim for some further details on the Americas and what we are doing in re-supply. As a personal user of an AirSense 10 device and an AirFit P10 mask, I like to change my mask on a regular sort of three monthly basis. Any patient who puts a piece of plastic on their face every day and wears it for six hour, seven hours I think would find that a hygienic and an appropriate thing to do. The numbers out there in the industry are far below that, well below that sort of 4x replacement per year. In fact I think there was some data from some governments showing around 1.8, 1.9 masks per year, which would mean lasting 6.5 months. Personally, I think there is a lot of runway as patients get more engaged with high deductible health plans and health savings accounts in the U.S. and take more control of their own healthcare, but they will invest the co-pay dollars or even full cash pay to receive that dot com type payments to get themselves involved in this as the deductibles go up and so on. But I am just talking from a personal patient experience. Jim, why don\u2019t you give sort of the broader U.S. market thought on that?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Thanks Mick and thanks for the question, Ian. The first thing I would say is, just as Mick is relating his own experience, it\u2019s really important to remember that we have a very firm belief that re-supply is very good for patients. The experience of therapy for patients is always made better by fresh equipment. Equipment does wear out, it gets old, etcetera. And so when the experience with therapy is better it leads to better adherence and just better long-term health for the patient. So \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the reasons I think both ResMed and our customers seek to drive re-supply. It also happens to be good obviously for our customers business. We have been working with customers for years to help them to understand how to efficiently re-supply patients. And with the advent of our Air Solutions offering, we have been able to provide some software platforms that help to automate that process. And as a reminder, we actually have two platforms now with the acquisition of Brightree. We have a platform called ResMed ReSupply, which is a platform we built out of the acquisitions of CareTouch and Jaysec previously. And that\u2019s an automated re-supply platform that has both a software component and a call center live call and automated call component. And then Brightree has a platform called Connect, which is also an automated re-supply platform. Both of them create a lot of value for our HME customers because it allows them to re-supply in a very cost efficient, cost effective way. And we have seen very good growth, both in terms of number of customers joining these platforms and grow the re-supply through them over the course of the year and that\u2019s an ongoing phenomenon for us. So our customers are enjoying the benefits of it. It has helped our re-supply numbers obviously, so our accessory sales. And it helps patients. Patients love getting fresh equipment on an appropriate basis because it improves their quality of therapy, their quality of life.", "Ian Abbott", "Alright. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Ian.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Matt Taylor", "Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me, okay.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes.", "Matt Taylor", "So I just wanted to cover one thing with the gross margin, previously you had said that Brightree was going to add about 70 bps to 100 bps, is that about what you saw in the quarter and is that what we should think about as kind of the contribution for the next year?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. Hi Matt. The Q4, it came pretty much in middle levels \u2013 it was 80 basis points that it contributed. And then look going forward I think I would stick with that range around that sort of 70 basis points to 100 basis points.", "Matt Taylor", "Okay. And I guess with the moving parts that you alluded to before the Aussie dollars you talked about but also euro is going down, how does that factor into your guidance for GMs for next year, so what are you assuming?", "Mick Farrell", "Alright. Matt, I apologize. I missed the first half of that question.", "Matt Taylor", "Yes. I am just asking with the euro as well, euro is a little bit weaker in recent weeks, how are you thinking about those two major currencies for gross margin next year?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. I mean that plays into I think \u2013 we talked about that a little earlier on. Just for \u2013 it does, I mean obviously, a weaker euro, a weaker pound or whatever it might be doesn\u2019t impact us there. If I looked at it just at least in this sort of near-term into Q1 with that sort of strengthening of Aussie and probably some weakening in some of the European currencies, we \u2013 I think all up probably at the moment, estimates probably a 50 basis point headwind for us going into Q1 and now it\u2019s just a question of, I guess then if currencies stay where they are from thereon in that you wouldn\u2019t see any further impact on a sequential basis. We might see a little bit on a year-on-year basis, but pretty volatile at the moment. So it\u2019s hard to say on that, but near-term, I would say it\u2019s about 50 basis points and of course that can change depending on what currencies do. But at the moment, I will put it around that kind of number.", "Matt Taylor", "Great. And then can you just give us a sense of how to model the interest and other expense for next year, since you have the debt from Brightree, I think due to modeling some income, you had some expense this quarter, any parameters you can give us around the interest rate or the \u2013 your cadence of the debt pay-down to help with that number?", "Mick Farrell", "Matt, the interest rate for us would be around \u2013 is rough number around that 2% mark in terms of funding costs on the interest \u2013 if you use that. Had Brightree basically the acquisition from close to the beginning of the quarter and I think we finished with kind of this net interest expense for the quarter around $2.4 million. So it\u2019s probably kind of a reasonable go forward number going into FY \u201817.", "Matt Taylor", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wheen with Evans & Partners. Please go ahead.", "Steve Wheen", "Yes. Hi guys. Just a quick question on that GPO announcement that you made, are there any milestones in terms of volumes that are required and is there any sort of color you can give around how that will contribute going forward. And then just if we could Brett, go sort of talk on the gross margin outlook for FY \u201817 you have mentioned FX and you have mentioned Brightree, but just any other sort of moving parts that we should be mindful of? Thanks very much.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the questions. Steve I will answer the first one and as you indicated, I will hand it to Brett for the second. The GPO announcement was really as an example of us executing on that channel strategy and you may or may not see further press releases from us about other GPO and government contracts that we have over time, but we don\u2019t give details of any particular customer and milestones associated with them on a sort of milestone basis. Essentially these GPO contracts are hunting licenses and then you are allowed to go in hospital-by-hospital and move forward on it, but it\u2019s an upfront negotiated air cover for the sales folks to go in there and work with those 3,600 hospitals and 120,000 other providers and push forward on our respiratory care growth within the channel. So I said in my prepared remarks, more to come on that front. There will be a lot more to come. We might not put press releases out on all of them. It was really just an indicator of where we are moving on that front. Brett, do you wanted to take the second question about gross margin?", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure. Yes. Steve, on the outlook there on gross margin, I guess as you know, there is a lot of moving parts on that. We have mentioned on FX if I look at certainly from a product mix perspective, it\u2019s definitely that sort of unfavorable mix is certainly moderated for us. It\u2019s far more consistent to the extent and Mick mentioned earlier in terms of new mask introduction and so on, you could probably expect that would be supportive on a product mix front as we get through FY \u201817. We have done \u2013 the team has been doing some really good work around the manufacturing procurement and so on. We have seen some of that come through. So I am quite positive on that. And then you have got, obviously the Brightree is now kind of built into that Q4 margin, but that will continue to be supportive as well. I mean you have the usual ASP declines and things like that coming through. But overall, in the mix I think some of the big unfavorable items are certainly moderating and potentially could have \u2013 as masks are introduced and so on, that should be beneficial. So overall, we have got \u2013 it\u2019s probably a near-term currency headwind that\u2019s a bit unhelpful. But overall, pretty comfortable with that 57% to 60% range and we are kind of more or less just about right in the midpoint of that range at the moment. So that\u2019s kind of how I would characterize the moving pieces.", "Steve Wheen", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the questions Steve.", "Operator", "Next we have a question from the line of Chris Kallos with Morningstar. Your line is open.", "Chris Kallos", "Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the cardiology trial Mick, from the sound of your \u2013 of the CAT-HF numbers, they are neutral to positive, does that now maybe reboot your efforts in cardiology and are you planning any more sponsoring of clinical trials in that space?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Chris. That allows us to talk to our sort of third horizon portfolio if you like. And we are absolutely dedicated to cardio-respiratory care since it\u2019s almost \u2013 I am not sure it\u2019s a medical term out there in the formal literature, it\u2019s something that we are really leading the market on and I would define it as sleep disordered breathing amongst atrial fibrillation, sleep disordered breathing amongst heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. And I would also include some play in hypertension and some other cardiovascular diseases. But clearly, the data from CAT-HF were incredibly exciting. I don\u2019t know if you had a look at the detail that was presented there at ESC or the Heart Failure Congress at ESC. But as you start to look at those clinical data and the level of clinical and statistical significance from a relatively small group of patients, it certainly indicates to us and if you talk to Chris O\u2019Connor, who is the primary investigator who was formerly at Duke and is still the PI on the trial, clearly our investigators in all the hospitals and all the clinicians involved want to do some follow-on work in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction space. So it certainly gives me more excitement in the space. The clinicians are very excited about it, the nurses, the doctors and we would like to continue to invest in the space. And so we won\u2019t go into details about what an investment will look like large multi-year clinical trials or a lot of market development work or some combination of the above. But you will hear a lot more from us regarding that Horizon 3 growth opportunity, including the CAT-HF trial and follow-up in the coming quarters.", "Chris Kallos", "Mick, just on that, is the data strong enough to incorporate into marketing to cardiologists and also these initiatives, are they in the next 2 years in terms of next steps, is that the sort of timeframe we are talking about?", "Mick Farrell", "So the data are not strong enough for an indication for use or IFU to start marketing to cardiologists. So no, it would require a lot further work on that front. What you might see is some work with \u2013 we talked about that trial with Kaiser Permanente, where we did some work on U-Sleep. We might work with payer providers, who are looking at these clinical data saying that\u2019s exciting, we would like to work on that in some sort of IRB or other controlled environment. But yes, I don\u2019t want to go into sort of real details here on the final question of our Q&A about what that part of Horizon 3 will look like at this point, but what I will say Chris is you will hear more from us over the coming quarters as to what we are doing in the cardio-respiratory care space, but it\u2019s pretty exciting data from CAT-HF. I am glad you noticed that.", "Chris Kallos", "Great. Thanks Mick.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Chris. May be one last question?", "Operator", "Yes, of course. Your next question comes from the line of Will Dunlop with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Will Dunlop", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could please give more detail on your rest of the world flow gens growth and what countries perhaps and what products are driving good 11% growth there? Please.", "Mick Farrell", "So I will hand over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO to talk about EMEA and APAC.", "Rob Douglas", "Yes. Will, thanks for that question. We \u2013 as you saw, we reported pretty good results through there. We are not going to break it up by country, but we saw good continued take-up of the AirSense platform. We had previously talked about the value proposition really came on very strong, but it\u2019s been a little more work to get that value proposition going in some of the other countries. And we are very pleased with the progress going through there. And so we are really seeing good take-up across the board with that. So it\u2019s really been a good result.", "Will Dunlop", "Okay. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks a lot for your question, Will.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour mark, so I will now turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "So in closing, I would like to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. I am really proud of what the team accomplished, not just here in Q4, but throughout the whole fiscal 2016 to establish ResMed really as the world\u2019s leading tech-driven medical device company. Through clinical research, new features that expand our products and solutions and our acquisitions, we are transforming how healthcare is delivered and shaping a new frontier in connected care in respiratory medicine. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. Thanks for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days. I will hand back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, everyone, again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marianna, and I will be your operator for today's call.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thank you, Marianna, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release it can be found on our website at investors.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance.", "We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Ferrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders who are joining us today, as we summarize our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales from Brightree and strong growth in our device platform categories.", "For the call today, I'll review high level financial results, outline regional highlights and then discuss progress towards our ResMed 2020 strategic goals. Then, I'll hand it over to Brett who will walk you through financial results in more detail.", "We continued to see the benefits of our leadership in connected care. The ongoing value proposition of the AirSolutions software resulted in strong growth for device platforms in both sleep and ventilation. Brightree's value to providers also led to recurring Software as a Service revenue from that part of our business.", "At the bottom line, in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 11% on a year-on-year basis in Q1. Including financing costs, our diluted earnings per share was $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis, which represents 5% year-on-year growth.", "We continue to balance revenue growth, gross margin improvements as well as ongoing investments in both R&D as well as SG&A, as we prepare for upcoming product launches across our global markets.", "Now for some regional highlights: The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by Software as a Service revenue from Brightree and 10% growth in that region in devices. Device growth was up against a robust 40% year-over-year comparable. The mask and accessories category in the Americas was flat in the quarter. We are very confident that we will drive strong growth with mask technology that we are launching this quarter. Just yesterday we started selling our brand new AirFit F20 product into our European market and we will launch another mask technology imminently in Europe.", "We tested both of these technologies with customers during the quarter and they were very well received in market trials with physicians, providers, and with patients. We plan to launch these new technologies into the Americas market during the current quarter. We are incredibly excited about these new products.", "In the Americas region, growth in devices was driven by the ongoing strength of the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 systems, powered by the cloud-based AirSolutions Software platform including AirView, U-Sleep and myAir offerings. In addition, we also saw solid performance in our respiratory care device platforms with the launch of cloud connected Astral ventilation systems.", "We achieved good growth in our combined EMEA and APAC regions with balanced contributions from both devices and mask categories. We are now on a solid positive growth trajectory in ASV therapy in the region. We're seeing good growth in patient groups including central sleep apnea, complex sleep apnea and pain management. We will see mask and accessories growth accelerate as we move forward with current and very near future product launches in the category as well as ongoing resupply partnerships throughout fiscal year 2017.", "We will show some of our new mask technologies to physicians and providers in the U.S. next week at Medtrade. Patient, physician and provider feedback from controlled product launches have been excellent and we know these masks will be very well received as they transition to full market launch.", "Let me now provide an update on our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. We continue to lead the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. We have high-quality Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree that continues to grow strongly. We are on track with our work to integrate Brightree software functionality with our core AirSolutions platform.", "We continue to invest in a portfolio of cloud-based computing solutions that help HME customers become even more efficient and help them free up cash flow that can be reinvested to drive even better patient care.", "Connected care solutions are improving operating efficiency, eliminating waste, increasing therapy adherence and improving patient outcomes. We are growing our connected care solutions in COPD as well as linking our technology to include other chronic care applications. This technology is a valuable asset that we will continue to leverage and provide insight to channel partners. This foundation of connected care is an integral part of our long-term strategic plan.", "Let me now take a few minutes to update you on the progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand over to Brett. In our first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep-apnea business, we have achieved sustained year on year growth since the launch of the AirSolutions platform more than eight quarters ago.", "We were a sponsor at the annual meeting of AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association that was held last week in Minneapolis. One of the main themes at AdvaMed 2016 was the importance of digital health, and the convergence of technology from data analytics to connectivity to patient engagement.", "This represents a significant shift from two to three years ago. I was on a panel titled Unlocking the Transformative Potential of the Internet of things, with colleagues from Deloitte and Medtronic, one of the other med-tech leaders in this area of connected care. While many companies are talking about digital health and connected care strategies, just a few of us are leading the way to value.", "We now have well over 2 million 100% cloud connected medical devices sitting on patient's bedside tables, liberating data every day. We turn Big Data into actionable information, which can unlock value for the patient, the provider, the physician and the payor. We are helping to reduce costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. With our expertise in sleep and respiratory medicine, we are also taking the lead with digital patient engagement tools that drive therapy adherence.", "Since we launched AirSolutions, we have been actively involved in clinical studies that show increased patient adherence and customer efficiencies, as well as demonstrate the value of our AirSolutions platform. Technologies like their AirView and U-Sleep improve patient adherence from baselines of 50% to 60% adherence all the way up to 80% adherence and above. These are game-changing capabilities.", "We just announced the results from the world's largest study on sleep apnea and connected care using our MyAir technology. This study included over 128,000 patients. These data will be presented at the Chest Medical Meeting tomorrow in Los Angeles and without stealing too much thunder from the investigators, at the highest level, these online self-monitoring tools engage patients and improve adherence to therapy.", "In the MyAir study, we showed an absolute increase in adherence of approximately 17 percentage points. This represents a relative increase in adherence of over 24%. This adherence study was executed in our core sleep apnea market, but we know that these technologies and capabilities can be applied to our ventilation and to our portable oxygen concentrator technologies for use in patients with COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases.", "During the quarter, we enhanced myAir with the launch of a new smartphone app, which has been very well received by patients. We now have well over 1,000 patients each day signing up for the myAir app. Patients love getting a daily myAir score for their sleep, learning about the quality of their sleep and learning about the quality of their breathing at night. Patients like to engage with their sleep health as much or more than their exercise health and the nutrition health. Our view is that these are three equal parts for good overall preventative healthcare.", "Moving on to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy. This quarter we announced positive results from a randomized controlled trial in the field of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation. The Acronym for this trial is HOT HMV. The data from this study were presented in September at the European Respiratory Society Congress in London.", "In HOT HMV, patients who received non-invasive ventilation in addition to home oxygen therapy had an astounding 51% decreased risk of re-hospitalization or death in the first year compared to patients who received oxygen therapy alone. Additionally, the patients who received at home NIV and oxygen experienced an average of 4.3 months without a hospital admission or death compared to 1.4 months for those on oxygen alone.", "The reduction in mortality speaks for itself for caregivers and loved ones. The extra almost 90 days without hospitalization also speaks to government payors and to private payors. In the U.S. market, hospitals face a Medicare payment penalty if COPD patients are readmitted to hospital within 30 days for any reason. A future where NIV and portable oxygen concentrators are standard of care to reduce mortality and reduce hospitalizations in COPD patients upon discharge is well within our second-horizon view.", "Turning to progress in our respiratory care product portfolio, more broadly, we launched cloud-connected conductivity for the Astral platform. We continue to enhance AirSolutions to provide more value for Astral so that it can provide value for COPD and neuromuscular disease patients and beyond. We are on track with the Inova acquisition integration process and we're leveraging our quality systems and product development expertise to further improve the Activox portable oxygen concentrator or POC platform. We expect to make good progress in the global rollout of Activox over the following 90 days and beyond. We have significant opportunities to grow POC revenue by selling through our global market channels throughout fiscal year 2017.", "COPD, as a reminder, is the number three cause of death in the Western world and it is the number two cause of re-hospitalization. We know that our spectrum of cloud connected respiratory care products across our portfolio will play a big role in reducing costs for providers and improving outcomes to millions of patients with this debilitating disease.", "Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of long-term opportunities including sleep health and wellness, atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the broader field of chronic disease management. In the area of sleep health and wellness, we announced a sleep awareness partnership with The Dr. Oz Show through the use of the S+ by ResMed device. The S+ is the world's first non-wearable sleep device and smartphone app designed to help people track, better understand and improve their sleep. Dr. Oz dedicated an entire show to the field of sleep wellness with guests including Dr. Michael Bruce, a board certified sleep specialist and Arianna Huffington, the Co-founder of the Huffington Post who has written broadly about the importance of sleep health.", "The sleep awareness campaign involves selling thousands of S+ devices and tracking anonymous sleep data to create a database with over one 1 million nights of sleep. Dr. Oz plans to calculate what he calls America's overall Sleep Score and to announce the results at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas early in 2017.", "For ResMed, this is about driving the importance of sleep health and helping consumers realize that they need to go see their doctor if they have any risky breathing or shortness of breath. These and other signs and symptoms of sleep apnea and COPD impact overall sleep health and overall health. This will be a critical part of the overall sleep awareness work.", "Moving from sleep awareness to hard clinical data, we presented positive results from the CAT-HF trial this quarter. The randomized clinical trial results were presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Annual Conference in Florida last month by the cardiologist and electrophysiologist Dr. Jonathan Piccini. Dr. Piccini's analysis showed a reduction in atrial fibrillation burden for heart failure patients who used ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV therapy to treat their sleep disorder breathing. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep disorder breathing with ASV may improve cardiovascular outcomes for patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This is a large population of heart failure patients for which there is no Class 1A guideline therapy.", "Researchers are finalizing the manuscript for full publication of the CAT-HF study. We are excited about the patient outcome data and the potential opportunities to save hospitalization costs for the healthcare system globally.", "Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new mask technologies globally. We continue to lead in connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients. Customers are voting for this technology by signing up for our patient engagement apps and by voting with their wallets. We are also leading the industry driving consumer awareness of sleep so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and healthcare providers for diagnosis and for treatment.", "We look forward to executing on our strategies to benefit physicians, providers, payors, and most importantly to improve the lives of tens of millions of undiagnosed sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world as we move forward.", "With that, I'll hand the call over to Brett for more comments. Over to you, Brett.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "All right. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 with more detailed commentary around revenue, given our recent acquisitions last fiscal year.", "As Mick noted, we had a solid start to the year. Group revenue for the September quarter was $465.4 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue also increased by 13%. Excluding the acquisition of Brightree, revenue increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.", "Excluding all acquisitions, organic revenue increased by 3% over the prior year quarter. Taking a closer look at the geographic level and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $267.9 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $164.5 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 5% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas' device sales were $145.6 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $122.3 million consistent with the prior-year quarter. For revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $113.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter and in constant currency terms also an increase of 6%.", "Masks and other sales were $50.9 million, an increase of 2% over the prior-year quarter and in constant currency terms an increase of 4%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 1% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $33.1 million.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers \u2013 the non-GAAP measures adjusted the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and one-time expense associated with the field safety notification. In the prior year comparable, I've excluded the amortization of acquired intangibles. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the September quarter was 58.9%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 90 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by an unfavorable but moderating product mix and typical declines in average selling prices. On a sequential basis, our gross margin increased by 70 basis points, largely attributable to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we are narrowing our guidance range and expect gross margins to be in the range of 58% to 60% for fiscal year 2017.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $128.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 15%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our SG&A expenses increased by 6% in constant currency terms. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.7% compared to 27% that we reported last year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 27% to 28% for fiscal year 2017.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $34.4 million, an increase of 27% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This increase largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses increased by 8% in constant currency terms. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 7.4% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.6%. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2017.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.7 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.4 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million.", "Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $111 million, an increase of 11% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $87.7 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $76.1 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, while diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54.", "Overall, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the weaker British pound and a stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.", "On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 will be in the range of 20% to 22%.", "During the quarter, we initiated a field safety notification regarding potential degraded battery performance in our Astral device. Under the notification, we will replace all the batteries in our Astral devices. In our Q1 GAAP results, we have recognized a charge of $5.1 million for the expected cost associated with this action.", "Cash flow from operations was $86.2 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increasing net working capital balances during the quarter. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $27.8 million.", "Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we expect to recommence the buyback in fiscal year 2018.", "At September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion in gross debt and $391 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.3 billion and net equity was $1.8 billion.", "And, with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have any additional question after that, please get back into the queue. Mariana, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners, your line is open.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the Brightree revenue growth. Just wondering, in the quarter whether or not you've seen any pushback from DMEs with regards to ResMed owning that particular software.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Steve. No, we haven't seen customers moving out of the Brightree system since ResMed acquired or announced the acquisition in February or closed the acquisition in April or has formally moved forward from then. So, we've had a good eight months of customers being aware of this, and what we've seen is customer love the value that's been provided. And they actually \u2013 I think the customers I've spoken to love the fact that there's a multibillion-dollar public company that's going to make sure they invest cash in this business for the long run, which is investing in the infrastructure and extracting value for our HME provider customers and adding even more value, as we integrate some of the functionality from Brightree, as we said in some of the prepared remarks, between Brightree and our broader AirSolutions platform across sleep apnea and COPD.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Okay. And is the gross margin on that revenue similar to what was reported when you gave the historical figures for Brightree when it was acquired?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Brett, do you want to drill down into some of the GM implications pre and post acquisition for Steve?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Steve, it's Brett. I mean, yeah, that's pretty consistent with when we filed the 8-K, for example, on profitability ratios and, obviously, Brightree contributes to our gross margin there as well. Let's just say, we've got \u2013 I mean, it's consistent with our expectations. We're very pleased with how we're progressing and how Brightree is progressing. So I think that's good, probably, business there and it's definitely meeting our expectation.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Andrew with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC", "All right. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mick, can you \u2013 or maybe Brett, can you talk about kind of the flat M&A or mask and accessory growth in the quarter? Maybe what are the inputs to that? Was it, perhaps, some people holding out purchases typical at the end of the quarter in front of the new product launch because you've been pretty vocal about having stuff coming?", "And then my follow-up is, within the 10% device growth, can you give us some flavor about the product mix and what the bigger drivers were within that across the range?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. So, first, the EMEA and APAC masks and accessory growth was 4%. Americas was flat. Obviously, we showed these new technologies at the European Respiratory Society Congress in September and, as you noted, Ben, we've been pretty public about that and so it had been out in the public forum. There may have been some impact on Americas' customers knowing that new products will be coming to market soon in terms of their purchases during the September quarter. But look, the way that we look at it is, we've got some excellent first results here on our controlled product launches on this product, the F20. It's an excellent full face mask that we think is going to be incredibly successful as we've tested it out there. And certainly, there were some customers testing it in the Americas and some customers testing it in Europe, and we did show it at the conference there in European Respiratory Society, but we do expect very significant growth for this throughout fiscal 2017 and we will launch the product, as I said, we launched it yesterday in Europe. And we will launch it \u2013 another technology into Europe and both technologies we plan to launch into the U.S. this quarter. So, I do think the future looks pretty exciting on that front.", "To the devices, breaking out the 10% year-on-year growth in devices in the Americas, we don't typically break it out precisely between how much was ventilation and how much of the growth was sleep, but we talk about the sleep apnea market generally growing in that sort of mid to high single-digit number and devices growing in the mid single-digits and masks growing at the high single-digits. So you can sort of look at that 10% and say, well, if it's mid single-digits on the sleep flow generators then there's some incremental growth from the ventilation and the portable oxygen concentrators on top of that.", "Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. And, I guess, if you'll allow me, I'll just ask about Activox and how you might size the OUS opportunity as you launch that over fiscal 2017 because that's the first you talked about that rolling out more broadly? Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, absolutely. Well, Ben, we'll give an update next quarter as we really start to roll that out. The point I was making in this call is that we've now got the quality to a level that we like and that we are launching it now throughout not only U.S. but our global sales forces over the coming quarter. And as you know, the sale cycle on POCs is an S-curve and you start to ramp that up this quarter, but we'll give an update in 90 days as to the progress on that. Thanks for the questions, Ben.", "Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is on the line with a question.", "William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just firstly wanted to ask you about SG&A growth accelerated this quarter, and I'm wondering whether that's related to the upcoming product launches or if there's something else in there, if you could talk about that would be great. Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Will, there are two factors involved in SG&A. One is the absorption of some of the acquisitions we've made and that has contributed to the SG&A. And in addition to that, as you noted, we're launching two new masks in Europe and we plan to launch them in the Americas and these things that we prepare for. We've done them many times, but you do prepare for them in terms of the marketing, promotional capabilities and so on. So, those two factors of the acquisitions and the preparation to new product launches were both factors in the SG&A.", "William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. And then, on gross margin, despite what seems to be quite a negative product mix effect in the U.S., you still posted very strong non-GAAP gross margin relative to the last few quarters. Can you just talk to the pricing environment in the U.S. and whether you are seeing pressure to cut prices and whether you think you will, as a result of Medicare funding cuts that went live in July? Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Will, I'll take the second part of that and I will hand it to Brett for the first part of that on the broader GM review and what's going on there. But with regard to pricing, we haven't seen anything out of the ordinary in pricing. You know this. Obviously, we don't break it out in detail here, but what I'd say is we've seen sort of what we've seen traditionally in year-on-year price deltas in our U.S. and other markets, throughout the whole CB process, it's been very visual and open as to what the new prices will be, and we've been working with our customers as soon as prices were announced six months ago, not as they start to go into play during this sort of July, August, September quarter. So, pretty steady as she goes in terms of historic price deltas there.", "But, Brett, do you want to provide a little color for Will with regard to what's happening there with GM?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, even though the product mix continued to be unfavorable for us, it's certainly moderating. That headwind has definitely moderated in this quarter, which is good. And the other thing also on ASVs, which is a pretty big headwind, our ASVs returned to a growth trajectory, and that's helping us on the product mix piece of this. It's not a headwind now.", "The biggest component there, I think, that has been driving through on the margins being manufacturing and procurement and sort of really getting some traction on those cost-out programs that we've been running all the time, but it's becoming more evident because of that product mix moderating. So, that's sort of working through.", "As you know, the first 12 months we couldn't really work on it. We were really concentrating or focusing on just meeting demand. But as we've worked through the last 12 months, we've been really able to ratchet up that program and the team's done a great job just working through on the various cost-out programs, particularly for the platforms. And that's definitely now flowing through on the gross margin. And, I guess, the other one, obviously, the Brightree acquisition is a meaningful contributor as well.", "So, I mean, I guess, you're saying some of these headwinds are perhaps turning into tailwinds. So we're seeing that come through on the gross margin.", "William Dunlop - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "David Low with JPMorgan is online with a question.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.", "Thanks very much. If we could now return to Brightree, I was just wondering if you could talk to the level of growth you've seen given we don't have much in the way of historics and perhaps some sense as to what integration benefits or what the opportunity feels like it could be now that you've owned it for, I think, you said, eight months?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Look, the Brightree growth is in that sort of low-to-mid teens, low teens sort of area, good solid double-digit growth. It's 80, 90%-plus recurring revenue there, David. So the Brightree business is a very solid and strong recurring revenue business. It's providing incredible value to providers automating process flows for inventory management, clinical informatics management, revenue cycle management in terms of ensuring payment and also even managing physician scripts.", "And so, when you think about the synergistic value, if you like, between a customer who is operating on ResMed's AirSolutions for patient engagement through myAir and physician engagement through AirView and now HME engagement through Brightree, there are many of those workflows that you can look to if you are removing costs from the front-end of patient engagement and the back-end of inventory management that there can be synergies in saving those costs for the HME provider.", "And so, we are working with all our customers who use both AirSolutions, Brightree and particularly those who use both to really help them garner those savings in their own operating costs to improve their own P&L and free up more of their own cash flow to then reinvest in better patient care and drive adherence rates up of the likes of what we've seen in the myAir study and the U-Sleep where we're able to achieve 80-plus percent adherence rates. That's a win for the patient obviously, but it's also a win for the physician getting the patient on therapy and the provider in terms of keeping that sleep apnea patient on good therapy and ongoing resupply.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.", "All right. Thanks. And if I could just change topics a little bit. You talked about the connected devices and I think more than 2 million connected with AirSolutions now. Just making sure that I understand, I mean, this is AirSense, AirCurve products, are the vast majority of those devices that you've sold effectively, connected devices now?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes. Since we launched the AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 lines, every single sleep apnea non-invasive ventilation device that we've sold has communications capabilities in it and so we have more than 2 million of them \u2013 well over 2 million of them sending data to the cloud every day, so that if it's sent at 6:30 in the morning, we call it the halo, hour after last off, by 7:30 in the morning those data are available for the patient that they can review on myAir, for the doctor if they go see them at an 8 o'clock appointment on AirView and even for the government of Finland or United Blue Cross Blue Shield in terms of their population health management into their systems that very day.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan Securities Australia Ltd.", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.", "Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our questions for \u2013 first for R&D and we're looking to see whether or not this increase in guidance is kind of the short-term related to acquisitions and integration or if this is kind of more of a longer-term strategy? And then my follow-up question is, with regards to the Curative acquisition, we're at the one-year mark. Is there any observations that you've made that were different from your initial expectations? Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the questions, Matt and I'll hand both of those, actually, over to Rob Douglas, our President and COO.", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes, thanks, Matt. Yes, the R&D increase largely has been around bringing the acquisitions in and the engineering work that we wanted to do make sure quality is right and really synchronizing the roadmaps and making sure everything is on track. We're committed to innovating in our industry and we see the R&D program sort of continuing apace. We've got a lot more things on our roadmaps than what we can actually do and a lot more plans and ideas and anything we can invest sensibly into the R&D program we will.", "On to your other question regarding Curative, you're asking about any differences from how the early integration program went? We're really encouraged with Curative and its position in the Chinese market. The whole Chinese economy has had some interesting developments and changes and things going on like anticorruption drives and stuff like that have made the market continue to be interesting. We still see a huge opportunity there just in terms of the number of untreated patients, both in obstructive sleep apnea and also in the number of untreated COPD patients in the standard of care there.", "We're making great progress on the integration program. We're very happy with the role of a few key players that we've got in China at the moment. We've got Justin Leong, who's sort of heading up our Asia Growth Markets Group and Jason Sun, who's remained as the CEO of the Curative subsidiary and together they are bringing together the team of Curative and ResMed and we're the major player in treating sleep disorder breathing and long-term ventilation in China and we've got lots of good plans to further develop that.", "Operator", "Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to know if you've got any early feedback on the launch of the new 20 series mask just from the market testing that you're doing? And then just a follow-up question is, to what extent does your outlook or your upgrade gross margin consider that new mask launch?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the questions, Andrew. Yeah, clearly, we've got some really good early data from the controlled product launches of F20 in Europe and in the U.S. markets in these sort of controlled product launches where we've had customers looking at the product, putting it on patients, seeing how the setup goes for a provider and working with physicians so that they can see the change of care. The F20 is a fabulous full face mask, one of the best I've seen that ResMed's produced and I think as you look forward over the next number of quarters, this thing is going to be a real winner for us.", "To your second part about upgrading our gross margin guidance, I'll let Brett go into that in more detail. But at a high level, yeah, there's a combination of ASV. As Brett said earlier, ASV has turned from a headwind now to tailwind. Mask growth is at its nadir here as we transition from two-year-old mask products to brand-new mask product and both of those tailwinds in terms of positive GM contributions. But Brett, any further color on that for GM?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Maybe we try to look at that and try to factor that in. As you know on gross margin, it's always hard to predict because you've got ASP movements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, what we do in manufacturing and procurement. What happens with how the acquisitions go on and so on, so sort of pool that in. But, I guess we're getting kind of more confidence in the range there on the margin and certainly we saw some really good improvements on the margin in Q1. And clearly we look to build on those.", "But in terms of the product mix, to the extent that the mask growth accelerates, then we think these masks will be successful and we do think we'll get shares back with these masks and clearly that's going to be supportive of the gross margin. And then it just depends on relative mix of devices versus masks and so on. But it certainly is \u2013 the expectation is those new masks will be supportive of the gross margin. I mean, you'd have to think that.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Yeah. Terrific. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Just to follow up a little bit on the mask commentary, given that you have rolled that out internationally and we're going to see it next week at MedTrade, could you just talk a little bit about what are some of the unique or differentiating points that you see in the mask versus what you've been selling and how should we think about things from the cannibalization and pricing perspective? Is this environment one where you can ask for some uplift in pricing versus what you are charging right now?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Matt. I'll take the second part, and then I'll hand the first part to Rob to talk about some of the features of the F20. Yeah. With regard to pricing, we work very carefully with our customers in each of the 100 countries we're selling to and each market we're launching to. This is some very innovative technology in these multiple mask technologies that we're bringing to market. And we are certainly working with customers to understand that value and ensure the price is appropriately in line with that value. And, so I see it rolling in as we traditionally have with our mask launches at appropriate pricing that takes account of the value but also takes account of the realistic nature of the markets in which we're selling in the healthcare world. Rob, do you want to take the second part?", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "The first part of the question, second.", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. These masks are really about comfort and feel and ease-of-use. Our early testing \u2013 all of our mask development programs are heavily involved with working with patients and trying ideas and working through, and it's sort of iterative, it keeps going. But we believe the F20 and the N20 have really superior seal and that they just don't leak, and that they're more comfortable and easy to use than earlier masks.", "To your question of cannibalization, the market will pull out as to what are the preferences, and people will have to develop their preferences over time for that, and so that will take some time to fallout. But we are extremely excited about the response that we've already had on these masks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. What I would add on there is, if there is any cannibalization, it's cannibalization of some of the competitors' positions in full face and nasal. So we will not only keep going in the market as we are with Dr. Oz and reaching out to new patients in, but I think we'll be taking some good share in these categories as we launch this amazing new mask technology.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. And then as a follow-up, just a little bit more color on the North American generator performance in the quarter. You had Astral, you said ASV is a tailwind, you are benefiting somewhat from the COPD purchase. Is it fair \u2013 and I know you have a really difficult comp here in fiscal Q1, but is it fair to say that that business is actually down when you exclude those other products or was it still positive?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "No, it was still up. We are not going to break it out in detail, but what I said earlier, I'll say again, which is the sleep market is growing mid-to-high single digits where the devices are growing mid-single digits, masks growing at high-single digits. We held share in our sleep devices.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Victor Windeyer from Citi is online with a question.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. Hi. Thanks very much. Look I just wanted to understand mask growth a little bit more, if I can on . The high-single digit mask rise, perhaps you could, like in the industry, if you like, but perhaps you could break out what is your number one volume growth and what the, I guess, the key factors are that are driving that. How long that can continue for?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks for the question, Vic. With regard to mask growth, revenues and volume, we don't break out pricing delta. What we acknowledged in the prep remarks and I'll say again, we lost some share in masks in the quarter. If masks are growing at high-single digits in the U.S. market and we're growing 01, then we're losing some share. We're very confident with the new masks we are launching. Well, we are launching today, yesterday in Europe and over this quarter. We plan to launch them again in the U.S. and beyond in global markets that we will get back to not only strong market growth, but above market growth as I alluded to earlier. These are great masks that will move us up there. So we're seeing good market growth of mid-to-high single digits in masks and there's always price declines to play in there, so you've got low-double digit growth in volumes of masks in the market that really hasn't changed from Q4 to Q1. It's more about the product lifecycle of our two-year old masks and the brand new ones that are just coming to market.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Okay. I guess, I was interested in understanding the importance of your informatics platforms to driving growth in the mask and supply side, and whether you can with your position there, you may get a better part of the share of that going forward?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Clearly we have a very large investment in the infrastructure with healthcare informatics and AirSolutions. There's a much more direct relationship between the informatics and the connected care and the value we provide to the device growth. We've seen that very strong for now, eight quarters since the launch of AirSolutions, AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10. There is a connection to masks. Clearly, it's often linked when you think about it all the way through to the ReSupply program. So we have ResMed ReSupply, we have Brightree Connect. We have a number of offerings in the U.S. market, a number of different offerings for customers in EMEA and APAC where the go-to-market models are different.", "We're engaging patients better than ever. Patients are signing up to understand things like myAir and as part of that we're absolutely contacting patients to let them know when it's time for a new mask and then to push them through the system. And, so I do think that \u2013 and different markets of the world there's different ways of doing that.", "You're going to see \u2013 as you look forward over FY 2017, 2018 and beyond, a lot more interplay not only between the informatics and device, informatics and masks but also informatics in chronic disease management, keeping these patients out of hospital and providing holistic value to the healthcare system by what we can do.", "Victor Windeyer - Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd.", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the questions.", "Operator", "Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.", "Thanks and good morning, guys. Mick, maybe the first question on the Astral and just if you could talk to what impact, if any, that field safety notice had? Also on sales and just what you see in terms of take-up of that device in the non-invasive ventilation category, please.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. So I'll take the second part and hand the first part of it to Rob. Sales of the Astral in terms of its use, it's pretty broad. It's different in every market in the world and in Germany, it's far more used as a life support ventilator and in the life support ventilation side. In the U.S., it's kind of split between Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular disease and COPD.", "With the changes in reimbursement that have been announced recently and have been ongoing for a year-plus in the COPD side, we've actually been focusing since we have no entrenched sales in this field saying to the customers, do you want non-invasive ventilation like an AirCurve 10 SST Bi-Level type product or do you want Astral and for which types of patients would you choose this? We are working with physicians and providers to do that.", "And so, we're really partnering with our HMEs and with the physicians to make sure and keeping the whole context of the healthcare economics that are involved to make sure that the right therapy goes on the right patient and that it's sustainable over time. So that's how we look at NIV as well as LSV for neuromuscular disease and COPD.", "But as for the field safety notice, Rob, do you want to?", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. So I'll just give a bit of background on it. We had a small number of reports of degraded battery performance. But there continue to be no adverse health effects from the degraded performance. And there are very clear mitigations for patients around it. But we felt it was the right thing to do to put out the field safety notice and alert ventilator-dependent patients and their carers about the issue, how they should mitigate the risks and where appropriate how to arrange for replacement batteries.", "It's a rolling replacement program. It is proceeding well, and we are communicating closely on an ongoing basis with the customers for this. We have to manage the patient population very, very carefully, of course, with this type of device. But the program is running along to plan at this stage.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Saul.", "Operator", "Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Good morning, everybody. Two quick questions. Mick, the first one is the \u2013 and I might have missed it, the time to full rollout of the new mask series. So when will it be available to all of your customers?", "And, secondly, I don't know if you could give us a sense of organic growth. I know you've split out Brightree nicely for us but broad organic growth for the rest of the business would be great.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "So I'll take the first part, and I'll give the second part of the question to Brett. So the time to the full rollout \u2013 one thing, we're obviously very open here on a public conference call, but we don't want to give full indication to our competitors as to the date, the time and the hour of the launch of the F20 in each of the specific country markets.", "I'll talk broadly to the fact that we've launched in Western Europe yesterday. So this is available across major countries in Western Europe already and that our plan is to launch into the Americas and the U.S. specifically this quarter. But I don't really want to go into any more granularity than that for competitive reasons on this call, Sean. But I can tell you this thing is going to take off and it's going to be a very valuable mask as it rolls to each of those countries as we launch it.", "Brett, do you want to have a breakdown of the acquisition versus organic growth question?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure. I mentioned that earlier Sean, so the organic growth in revenue for us was 3% this quarter.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Okay, great. Thank you. That's all I have, guys. Thank you very much.", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Great.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the breakdown of the acquisitions. Can you just talk about not just the top-line growth, how much did acquisitions contribute to the bottom line this quarter?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Brett?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes. Matt, we've sort of broken down and given more details in terms of revenue but we haven't gone down line by line or segmentation out in terms of the acquisition. So at this discussion, we would prefer to keep it that way.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Just curious...", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "I will say that, you know, I mean, you know that in the 8-K on Brightree, for example, which is the largest acquisition by far, the ratios are not inconsistent with historical, so that will give you at least a sense of it.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And then, I want to address, there has been a number of initiatives that have been talked about by the government in terms of being on kind of a watchlist with sleep testing with vents. I guess, is that a risk that you see for any of those parts of your business or do you think this is sort of just normal activity on the part of the government with regard to some of their investigations?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes, Matt, look, I think the government has regularly looked at their spending in all parts of healthcare whether it's in pharma, in different areas of med-tech and clearly, this is something that is important to make sure that the government's money is invested well.", "There are 40 million to 60 million Americans who suffer from sleep apnea and we've only got 6 million of them who are suffocating \u2013 6 million of them on therapy. We need to get to the other tens of millions and it needs to be done appropriately and economically. And we are partnering with every government where we do business to make sure that we can appropriately and economically diagnose and treat those patients and keep them out of the hospital care system because it's much less expensive to have a patient safely breathing at home than badly breathing and needing to visit the ICU or CCU.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for the thoughts.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Thank you for taking my question. Sorry to go back to gross margin, but just on the Brightree acquisition, I think previously you've mentioned that that would have added between 70 basis points and 100 basis points. And I'm just comparing that to the actual results this time around, and I know there are multiple factors here but can we \u2013 is it possible to sort of get a correlation between what you expected Brightree and what it actually has added this time around to gross margin?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Chris, this is Brett. It would be that the Brightree contributed at the top of that range for this quarter.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "So out of the 90 basis points, most of that is Brightree?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "No, there's basically positive and negative, right, so it's going to be \u2013 in absolute terms it's going to be, as I said, on top of that range we said I think 70 to 100 and that's towards the top of that range in terms of basis point contribution. But then in case you have any impacts from ASP declines, you have negative impacts from product mix still flowing through. But we had good contributions, very strong contribution from manufacturing procurement improvements and then also Brightree. They're probably the kind of the four big elements that are playing out on the gross margins. So you can't \u2013 you've got kind of -it's a mix situation that you end up with.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Sure. So, it's tracking as expected more or less?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. And Brett, can I just trouble you for the device sales non-U.S? Again, I just missed that number.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Device sales non-U.S. 6% was the EMEA and APAC constant currency growth.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "We are now at the one-hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks a lot, Marianna. And in closing, I want to thank the now more than 5,000 strong ResMed team from around the world for their commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients with every breath. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020 literally by giving a product that helps the patient who is suffocating or couldn't breathe before, breathe afterwards.

My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thank you, Mariama. And thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO, and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call.

Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Agnes. And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth again this quarter, led by sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses as well as our new mask products. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then outline regional highlights from the business and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.", "Let me start out with some timely news. Earlier this week, we announced the much anticipated launch of the world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. The AirMini is a CPAP solution that is literally small enough to fit inside your pocket. This innovation opens up new channels of cash payment for our homecare provider customers and delivers amazing, compact, quiet, therapeutic comfort to patients.", "As a CPAP user myself, I have been using a ResMed AirMini prototype in AutoSet mode for the last year or so and it has changed my quality of life as I travel throughout many of the hundred countries where we sell our products and services. I can't wait for this technology to become available to millions of sleep apnea sufferers around the world as we launch the world's smallest CPAP. I'll talk more about this amazing solution later in the call.", "On the connected care and digital health front, we launched a number of ongoing upgrades of our Brightree and AirView software solutions. Our Software-as-a-Service revenue continues to grow rapidly. Throughout Q3, we have had strong demand for our new range of AirFit masks, including the AirFit N20 in the nasal category and the AirFit F20 in the full face mask category. We have ramped up manufacturing for these products throughout the quarter. And despite continued strong demand, we remain on track to have supply ahead of demand during our current quarter, fiscal Q4.", "At the bottom line in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-on-year basis. Our diluted EPS was $0.71 on a non-GAAP basis. We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring appropriate investments in research and development as well as SG&A so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across global markets.", "Now let me drill down on some regional highlights. The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth. These results were fueled by SaaS revenue from Brightree as well as solid growth in masks. Device revenue growth this quarter was consistent with the market, and overall patient volume growth is steady. The mask and accessories category grew 8% in the quarter in the Americas. This is up sequentially from Q2, reflecting a strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products. The 97% to 99% fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal of the N20 and F20 are being well received. There's a long way to go on the ramp of these mask products in the quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018.", "Growth in devices in the Americas was in line with the market, at 3%. That was up against a large year-over-year comparable of 15%. We are maintaining the share we gained during the last 18 to 24 months due to our great devices as well as ongoing homecare provider adoption of AirView solutions and our fast-growing patient engagement app, called myAir. We now have over 3 million patients monitored with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also have more than 5 million patients in AirView and over 45 million patient accounts in Brightree.", "We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers, patients on a daily basis. We are proud to lead the digital health revolution in sleep apnea and COPD, but we are even more excited by the value that our customers see and how we are reducing costs for therapy setup and enhancing adherence rates for patients, leading to better outcomes.", "Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model. This quarter, we launched enhanced features integrating document management capabilities between Brightree and AirView. We have a robust pipeline of software-enhancement projects that will add even more features to help make our customers' workflows more automated and efficient, freeing up cash flow for even better patient care. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms, led by the cloud-connected life-support ventilator called Astral.", "Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our EMEA and APAC regions. Mask and accessories sales for the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 12% this quarter, driven by the launch of our N20 and F20 products. We continued to received positive feedback in Europe and Asia from patients, physicians, home care providers regarding both the broad fit range as well as the enhanced comfort of the N20 and F20.", "This quarter, we also achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators and Adaptive-Servo Ventilation range in Europe and Asia. Adoption of AirView by home care providers and myAir by patients is increasing in Europe as well. We achieved solid growth of our dental mandibular repositioning device called Narval. Our philosophy is however you seek treatment for your sleep apnea, ResMed should be there for you.", "Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 Growth Strategy, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care solutions. We launched our new F20 and N20 in the U.S., Europe and many other major markets around the world in the second quarter. We continue to see exceptionally strong demand for these products that led to demand continuing to outpace supply for some of the SKUs in Q3. Consistent with what we predicted 90 days ago on this call, we expect our supply to catch up with and get ahead of demand during the current quarter, fiscal Q4 2017.", "As I briefly discussed earlier, we announced the launch of the ResMed AirMini this week. The ResMed AirMini, once again, is the world's smallest CPAP. And, yes, it's also an APAP, with availability of our proprietary AutoSet algorithm. And, yes, it also has built-in humidification with no water that needs to be added each night.", "In addition, there is an AirMini app that can be used with your iOS or Android smartphone so that patients can continue to stay engaged with their therapy even when they are on the road. You can check out details in our newsroom, at newsroom.resmed.com. The key summary statement is we have created the world's smallest and most portable CPAP that literally fits in your coat pocket.", "One of the biggest requests for portable CPAP devices is the need for humidification. We have created humidification technology that's integrated into the mask tubing that we call HumidX. This amazing innovation requires no water to be added and provides patients with the humidification and comfort they have learned to expect from ResMed. Our well-established AirSense 10 device range is still the best device for at-home use. Our brand new AirMini just adds to that as the best device for use on the road.", "We have been conducting controlled product launches in select countries and the feedback from patients and providers on the AirMini has been excellent. We also showed the ResMed AirMini to physicians at the Sleep and Breathing Conference in Marseille, France. The doctors that saw the product there are very excited to add this to their portfolio of sleep apnea solutions for their patients. We will provide more details as we launch the ResMed AirMini over the coming quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018.", "We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our Growth Strategy. In February, the European research firm, Berg Insight, released their annual Mobile Health, or mHealth and Home Monitoring Report. This report named ResMed as a key global leader in remote patient monitoring, with over 2 million devices connected. We just announced that we are actually well beyond 3 million devices that are 100% cloud connected. As the world's leading tech-driven medical device company, we now have more than 1 billion nights of sleep data.", "Our digital health apps have been clinically proven to improve patient adherence and our software has demonstrated that it lowers the cost of therapy setup. We are developing and enhancing advanced cloud-based algorithms literally every day to convert big data into actionable information. The goal is clear; we want to lower costs of the health care system and provide better care and better outcome for patients. We are looking at partnerships with other players in digital health to enhance value across disease states, from sleep apnea and COPD to other important chronic diseases. Watch this space.", "On the clinical front, ResMed sponsored a research study that was presented at the Sleep and Breathing Conference that I mentioned in Marseille. This new study showed that switching patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea from CPAP to ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV technology, significantly improves adherence. This is the largest analysis of patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. The de-identified aggregated data included over 200,000 patients and leveraged our connected care and digital health platforms to run the analyses.", "In short, the study showed that adherence rates were increased, with a relative improvement in adherence of 22%. These patients also used their ASV therapy longer and had significantly fewer apneas during sleep compared to the control group. This study highlights the need to continuously monitor central sleep apnea and to consider therapeutic options, like ASV, based on each patient's disease severity.", "Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 Growth Strategy. We are in the early stages of driving our connected care strategy in COPD, and we are making good progress. We have a spectrum of cloud-connected respiratory care products across our portfolio, including cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators in the AirCurve range, cloud-connected life support ventilators, such as Astral. We also have projects on the books for cloud-connected portable oxygen concentrators.", "With over 200 million patients suffering from COPD and with the disease state being the number-three cause of death and the number-two cause for re-hospitalization in the Western world, we are intently focused on testing and driving models that both lower cost and improve outcomes for COPD, neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and beyond.", "Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as clinical adjacencies, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This quarter, the CAT-HF Study was published in the Journal of American (sic) [Journal of the American] (15:15) College of Cardiology. This is the first study to show that addressing sleep apnea with ResMed's ASV therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes for people with preserved ejection fraction heart failure. The overall CAT-HF Study results were neutral, with a pre-specified subgroup analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure who also have sleep apnea.", "Currently, there are no level of evidence 1A guideline recommended therapies specific for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure, which accounts for half of all people living with chronic heart failure. We believe that having the CAT-HF Study published in a major cardiovascular clinical journal is the start of a journey that may prove that ASV therapy can help patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure.", "Another key area of Horizon 3 growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice. This is an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our SaaS portfolio offerings.", "Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017, including, of course, the new ResMed AirMini. We continue to pioneer connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients.", "We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep apnea and COPD so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and health care providers. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today I'll provide an overview of our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the March quarter was $514.2 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 14%. Excluding acquisitions and in constant currency terms, organic revenue increased by 6% over the prior-year quarter.", "Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree acquisition, our sales in the Americas were $297.1 million, an increase of 5% of the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific totaled $182.1 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific increased 9% over the prior-year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $158.4 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Revenue in combined EMEA and Asia-Pacific device sales were $122.7 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 8%.", "Masks and other sales were $59.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter, or again in constant currency terms, an increase of 12%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 5% while masks and other increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $35 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low-double digits.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring expenses. It the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses. We've provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our third quarter earnings press release.", "Our gross margin for the March quarter was 58.3%. On a year-over-year basis, our gross margin increased by 100 basis points, reflecting manufacturing and procurement efficiencies and the favorable impact from our Brightree acquisition, partially offset by typical declines in average selling prices and unfavorable currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in Q4 to be broadly consistent with our Q3 gross margin,", "Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $137.9 million, an increase of 16% over the prior-year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses also increased by 16%. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and in constant currency terms, our SG&A expenses increased by 9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.8% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we've updated our guidance on SG&A as a percentage of revenue and expect it to be in the range of 26% to 27% for Q4 FY 2017. R&D expenses for the quarter was $35.1 million, an increase of 25% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 21%. This largely reflects the impact of our recent acquisitions and incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, our R&D expenses in constant currency terms increased by 5% over the prior year. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.8% compared to the year-ago figure of 6.2%.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for Q4 FY 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $6.8 million over the prior year, reflecting the additional amortization associated with our recent acquisitions. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.5 million.", "Non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter was $126.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $100.7 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.62. Note that our prior-year earnings per share comparable was restated as a result of our adoption of Accounting Standard (23:04) whereby we recorded a tax benefit of $2.3 million in Q3 FY 2016. In the current quarter under the standard, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.4 million.", "Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted third quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting an unfavorable impact from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%. And, looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for Q4 FY 2017 will be in the range of 21% to 22%.", "During the quarter, we recognized restructuring expenses of $7.9 million associated with the closure of our Paris manufacturing facility. Cash flow from operations was $67.6 million for the quarter. This reflects strong underlying earnings offset to some extent by an increase in net working capital balances during the quarter, in particular an increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable associated with the timing of creditor payments this quarter. It also included the payment of contingent consideration associated with our Curative acquisition and the payment of the BMC/3B litigation settlement. Note these items were accrued in our previous Q2 results.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $14.6 million while depreciation and amortization for the March quarter totaled $28.5 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of 10% over our prior-year quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. At present, we're still expecting to recommence the buyback sometime in fiscal year 2018.", "At March 31, we had $1.17 billion in gross debt and $341 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At March 31, total assets were $3.4 billion and net equity was $1.85 billion.", "And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A. And we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question.", "Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Yes. Hi. This is Matt Henriksson in for Joanne. Our first question is with regards to the current environment for the CPAP treatment adherence, is there any commentary that you could give on the overall market, both at a patient level and just general trends?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Matt. With regards to adherence of patients on therapy, there's been many changes over the years. Traditionally in the peer-reviewed published press in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, adherence rates in the 50% to 60% were published in the literature. Particularly with our connected care and digital health solutions, particularly AirView and, most recently, myAir patient engagement apps, we have now peer-reviewed and published clinical data showing up to 87% adherence when patients are using some of our digitally-enhanced cloud-connected devices and engagement apps, such as myAir.", "So, there's really a revolution in patient adherence happening through connected care and digital health to get to those 80%, close to 90%, adherence rates. And it changes the game. It's better for patients, it's better for their doctors, it's better for the health care system because the patients who use therapy are less frequent fliers into hospitals. So we think it's good for the overall system.", "Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. That's great. And then just kind of general trends in the market. How are you seeing the market growth rates?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "So, Matt, we see the global respiratory medical industry growing in the mid to high-single digits with masks growing at the high end of that and devices growing at the low end of that. And that's where we see it broadly globally. And maybe slightly ahead of that in the U.S. or slightly behind that in Europe, depending on some seasonal and economic factors, but those are the general growth rates, in the sort of mid to high-single digits.", "Matthew Henriksson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the questions, Matt.", "Operator", "Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment, Brett, just on the gross margin and the various components that are contributing to that. I guess I'm a little surprised with the guidance for fourth quarter that it is going to be stable on third just because you are getting the benefit of that mix shift. So, what you were anticipating might be coming through to dilute some of that.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, Steve. As Mick said, we expect it to be back orders or (29:10) basically supply running ahead of demand and we've got pack (29:15) capacity there. So that comes through in Q4. But then I think there'll be some ramp up by then (29:20) within the market.", "The other thing I think in the Q4 we'll still be facing some headwinds in things like air freight and so on where we've sort of scrambled to catch up and fill the chain a bit. But that trend moderated a bit into Q4 as well. So just some of those factors are I think that we said looking at short term, we're kind of comfortable where we are.", "Clearly, we look at mask trajectory. To the extent you get outperformance in mask growth in a relative sense, then certainly that would support improvement in gross margins. So, taking more of a short-term view on the current guidance on that, given a couple of the headwinds around things such as air freight that we'll have to deal with I think through the quarter. But then expect that \u2013 we see that mask growth in there certainly that'll be supportive of the gross margin going forward.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Yes. So the air freight cost is going to be enough to offset even in today's quarter result, the mix shift should've been more favorable, I guess. So, are there any other costs other than air freight?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, just think through it a little bit. Certainly, we've seen a big stabilization in product mix compared to what we've seen. But some of the big mix shifts before previously, don't forget, we had device growth which was huge, so we might have had spreads in those growth rates of 20% or 30%. So that really did exaggerate the impact on product mix. So you'll certainly see some benefits with product mix. But you'd need to see quite differentiated growth rates to see sort of massive movements I guess in that product mix.", "So it will certainly be positive. But you just \u2013 we have to look at the relative growth rates that we get through FY 2018 as we kind of ramp through the new product range and then form a better view after we see true trajectory I think on the new masks.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Andrew Goodsall with UBS is on the line with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to clarify that you are in fact backorder into the fourth quarter. And just another question on the masks. Just when we might expect to see a 20 Series Nasal Pillow?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, we were on backorder in a number of the SKUs throughout Q3. As we predicted 90 days ago, we said we would be throughout Q3 and would getting supply ahead of demand in Q4. And we're reiterating that model. We still were on backorder on some of the SKUs at the end of Q3, but we are well on track with the factories ramping up their manufacturing to get supply ahead of demand in this current quarter we are in, Q4.", "As Brett said, that comes with a cost of some air freight. But we think getting patients this technology needs to happen and we're willing to invest in the temporary air freight to make sure that happens and we can get off the backorder this quarter and get ahead, get our supply ahead and get the supply chain catching up and look for the benefits from that throughout 2018.", "To your second question with regards to future products. We don't talk about products that are not yet released nor the timing of those. I'm very happy to talk about the product we released or talked about launching this week, the ResMed AirMini. But we won't talk about product pipeline, products that are not yet released.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Sure. And just to my quick follow-up, just on the U.S. tax reform announcements, just any thoughts around repatriation capital?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Well, I might have a first answer to that and hand over to Brett. We think it's good for business if we design a product in Sydney, Australia and manufacture it in Singapore and sell it in France, we don't think we should have extra tax on that money if we want to reinvest it in the United States. And so, we think some of the opportunities to allow companies to invest some of their cash in the U.S. is a good policy potentially.", "And, obviously, you've got to see that it can get through Congress and actually become law. But if there are some areas of tax relief for us to reinvest funds into, say, our Atlanta manufacturing facility or our Los Angeles, California motor design and manufacturing facilities, and beyond that, our software engineering capabilities in San Diego and Atlanta, Halifax, we would absolutely consider bringing more funds into the U.S. and North America.", "Brett, anything to add on that?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "No. I think that's a good summary, Mick. I'd just say that I think, that in principle we'd be pretty happy with a repatriation tax. But I think the key would be what sort of rate they attach to that repatriation tax, which would probably be a lot of negotiations, seeing what they come up with. But I think, in principle, we think it's good. It could be an opportunity for us. But, of course, we just have to wait for the detail before I get too excited I think at this stage.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "No problem. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is online with a question.", "Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Maybe the first one for Mick, please. Can you talk through the drivers of overall domestic device market growth or demand, how that might vary from quarter to quarter based on product launches? And maybe as you look out, what can ResMed do to bring that domestic device market growth into the mid or high-single digits and over what timeframe that can happen?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Americas device growth was 3%. Masks was stronger at 8%-plus. And overall growth excluding Brightree was at 5%. So well in that sort of mid to high-single digits in the overall category.", "Look, one of the catalysts for moving those numbers up, there's many. We're doing a lot of sleep wellness and sleep awareness work with Pegasus Capital and Dr. Oz. You're going to see a number of sleep awareness promotions through our SleepScore Labs' investment with those folks. And a lot of getting out to the 40 million people who are suffering every night and snoring and not getting diagnosed as opposed to the much smaller than that, 5 million, 6 million, 7 million, 8 million who are already on therapy in the U.S. And we'll not just be doing that in this country; we'll be doing it globally on sleep awareness and sleep wellness.", "The other way that we're looking to drive device growth is obviously by moving our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators. The whole connected care revolution that happened in sleep apnea will happen in COPD, a much more severe disease state. And that will allow us to bring some high-margin device growth in life support vents and non-invasive vents. So, there's some upside in both of those areas.", "And the third and final area I'd say is taking this idea of this travel CPAP niche and making it a little more mainstream. I think bringing ResMed's technology to something that's the size of the water bottle in front of me. And you can have a look at the videos. We've now released the size of this product. It's about five inches by three inches by two inches. I think having the world's smallest travel CPAP with ResMed's technology and no water added for humidification and ResMed's AutoSet capability will grow that relatively small niche now to be significantly larger and allow ResMed to really drive that category.", "So those three things are potential catalysts for us to drive up that device number. And I've got to tell you, we plan to do it.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "And in terms of the timeframe I think was the tail end of the question.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes. So, look, all those things are going on in parallel and have different time frames. The sleep awareness is an ongoing one that we're planning over a long-term period. The connected care into COPD, again, is a long-term, you know we call it Horizon 2, Horizon 3 Strategy, but it's incredibly strong on benefits. Reasonably quickly we'll start to see how well the travel CPAP niche grows. And we're starting from a very low base of what's out there already, but we're really excited to play in all three of those.", "Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC", "And just as a follow-up maybe to the overall company growth. Can you give us an idea of what the organic Brightree growth was in this quarter? And maybe provide some context about what maybe you've been surprised by about Brightree in the last few months in terms of leverage points, owning the business and really its ability to drive stronger overall company revenue growth into that high-single digit range? Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yes. Sure. Brett, do you want to break out the numbers for the U.S. with and without Brightree and what Brightree's growth was? And then I'll go into some of the more strategic elements of how we're leveraging that.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure. Yes, as we mentioned on, I think it was really on the Brightree revenue on the third quarter revenue for Brightree was $35 million, tracking quite nicely. And that's tracking low-double digit growth for the Brightree business this quarter.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "In that took, in essence, our Americas growth without Brightree at 5% to Americas growth with Brightree in the double digits really strong 18% top-line growth there in the Americas with Brightree.", "How are we looking at that strategically? I mean, obviously, we have full separation of the commercial teams on go-to-market on the sales teams on Brightree versus ResMed. But as we look at the broader market, having a SaaS capability to map workflows, reduce the costs of document management, inventory management, physician and prescription management and helping even with revenue cycle management for our customers, has really been an advantage for ResMed, an advantage for the customers, the homecare customers that have partnered with us in allowing efficiencies and freeing up cash flow so they can invest in better patient care.", "And then tying it to the digital side on the back end where we run AirView and myAir and are able to drive adherence rates from 50%, 60% to 80%, 90%, there's just huge upside in terms of the quality that that homecare provider provides to their customer, the doctor and their customer, insurance company in terms of keeping those patients out of hospital and happy for the doctors and the payers. And also for the patients themselves. And so it's kind of like altruism is linked to the profit motive when you're able to drive adherence up. And we're really excited to be able to do that with our connected care solutions.", "Margaret M. Kaczor - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Margaret.", "Operator", "Chris Kallos from Morningstar is online with a question.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question about cardiology. You mentioned the CAT-HF Study and some promising results in the subgroup analysis. What are the next steps in this area? And what can we expect on the clinical trial fronts?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, so we're really excited about the CAT-HF analysis on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Obviously, that study was across both HFrEF and HFpEF. But on the HFpEF side, the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction side, having a statistically significant improvement was very strong. And getting published in JACC we think is a major accomplishment. But it's the start of a longer-term journey, as you know, in this space.", "We have a number of follow-on clinical analyses that we are going to work on there. Professor Chris O'Connor who was working with Duke and now with Inova Heart Institute in the Washington D.C., Delaware area is absolutely \u2013 and all the \u2013 not just the primary investigators, but all the investigators that are working on CAT-HF are really excited about follow-on work. We're looking at other studies in Western Europe where there's some very similar results, where ASV can have a very good impact on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients.", "But these are long-term investments. They're not this quarter, next quarter. But over the next year, two, three, we think that that group, which is about half of all heart failure patients, that there's some really good upside in terms of keeping these patients out of hospital with no other pharmacological or device Class 1A guideline therapies. We think that's just an opportunity that we have to pursue, so we're going to be pursuing that over time. And we'll give updates on a periodic basis.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Great. And perhaps could you give it breakdown of where ASV now stands in the mix?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure. Well, ASV, we don't break out the category specifically, but I will say, as a general trend, it has absolutely turned around from the nadir, if you like, from SERVE-HF a quarter or two or three ago to strong growth and in line with and ahead of some of the growth of the other categories, particularly in Europe. We've seen the European team really double down on ASV for treatment-emergent central sleep apnea.", "That study that we did on over 200,000 patients \u2013 think of that, 200,000 patients in a clinical study using the digital health and connected care. That brings two things to bear; not only the use of digital health and connected care for clinical studies that can get published, but also a much larger population base that can show ASV can be better than CPAP for treatment of those types of patients in terms of adherence. So watch this space. There's more to come on combining digital health and clinical studies and looking at therapies like ASV, life support vent and non-invasive vents.", "Chris Kallos - Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.", "Great. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Will Dunlop from Merrill Lynch is online with a question.", "William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on cash flow. Your data (44:17) and inventory days both jumped up this quarter sequentially. I'm just wondering if that's a bit of a blip and you expect that to normalize at the end of 4Q?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi, Will. It's Brett. Yeah, if I look, December was probably compared to our normal quarters, we were in a pretty good position on receivables. If I go back year-on-year and look at it last year, it was pretty consistent on DSOs, for example, on receivables. So I think it's more of December being particularly good rather than March being particularly bad. So I think it's okay there. I think that'll normalize into Q4.", "And there's just a few other one-time payments were being made through the quarters which pushed our cash flow down a bit lower in March than what you'd typically see. But I do expect that to normalize into Q4.", "William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.", "Okay. Thanks. And just on the U.S. flow gen growth rate of 3%, do you think you lost market share in the quarter? And, if so, were there any one-offs or any reasons, any contracts perhaps as a result that led to that?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Will. Actually, we think we held share. In fact, the incredible growth of share that we've achieved over the last 18 to 24 months since the launch of AirSense 10 and also Air Solutions and the AirView platform. We took very strong share with strong double-digit growth. But we think the market growth is mid to high-single digits for the whole industry. But flow generator growth is below that mid to high-singles and mask growth is at the high end of it.", "So we think we held the really strong share that we gained these last four to six quarters. But I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of the Americas. Any further detail with regard to share and holding and growing that?", "James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Mick. No, I think Mick summed it up really well. Our market data shows that we held our very strong share position in the market in flow gen, which means that in the quarter we grew about in line with market.", "William Dunlop - Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.", "Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Will.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on that flow gen thought. You called out a tougher comp, but you had a much tougher comp last quarter, still grew over that with the flow gen. Was there something new in the market that would have taken that growth rate down? I think you still have the best solution, but just curious why we saw that change in the growth rate.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, it's really a return to market growth rate there. Which, again, ResMed we don't accept market growth rates; we like to drive ahead of that. Having six to eight quarters of outpacing the market to have a quarter where you're at pace with the market I think is acceptable for a 90-day run. But we don't want to have the adjusted market growth rate forever.", "And I answered a little earlier with Margaret's question of three areas that we're looking to through getting more patients into the funnel through driving device growth in COPD, neuromuscular disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy for our non-invasive vents and life support vents and POCs. But then also launching the world's smallest CPAP to drive really a cash business through our homecare providers, where we have a retail business from our homecare providers to patients to grow a really exciting niche.", "65% of sleep apnea sufferers travel more than four to five times a year in the U.S. And right at the moment, half of them don't take their device because it's too big. I think that whole area is a really exciting one for us to grow. So, look, we don't want to sit back and just accept market growth rates of 3% to 5% or 5% to 7% or 7% to 9% on the various categories. We want to drive well ahead of that. And we have a lot of strategies to do that.", "We've had a great six to eight quarter run of incredible growth based upon our price strategy of changing the basis of competition from smaller, quieter and more comfortable to smaller, quieter, more comfortable and more connected. And we're not done with that. And that growth and that share we gained as you saw in the quarter is very sustainable because we're able to have customers get very involved in the workflows of AirView and really want to keep it as part of their business. So we think there's a lot of opportunities to come. And as I said earlier, watch this space as we continue to grow this market.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you for that. And then just one follow up on the P&L. I was just hoping maybe Brett could clarify what is in the other income there? You have $3.5 million. Can you just parse that out?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, that predominantly FX, Matt, or FX gains there basically our hedging contracts and so on. So that rolled through other income.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray is online with a question.", "J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "J. P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig into a comment that Brett made earlier about on the pricing side of it. It seems like maybe the pressure there has picked up a bit and I just wanted to dig into it. Is it more the mask or the generator side? And is this from competition picking up on pricing, or is it just the DME customers maybe feeling a little more of the competitive bidding squeeze rolling out through this year? Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, J. P. I know I got to tell you, competitive bidding has been in play for seven years now, 28 quarters. And there was no new news in the last 90 days. So we've seen relatively stable pricing within the U.S. geography, and frankly. Also in the other 99 countries we do business in. We haven't seen any major changes to pricing.", "I'll hand to Jim. Any further color within the U.S. market with regard to pricing effects of CB?", "James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.", "Well, competitive bidding and the reimbursement environment has been an ongoing challenge for our customers now for several quarters, as I think everybody knows. But there was nothing unusual in the quarter related to pricing. We see about the same annual downward pressure on pricing as we've seen in the category for a long time.", "J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Sure. Thank you. And one more for Brett, if I could. Just on operating cash flows, if you look at it year-to-date, I guess for you guys for the last nine months, it's down probably 32% from where you were last year. It looks like you got more eaten up in inventory and AR. I'm just trying to figure out why that is, especially now that you have Brightree involved.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure, yeah. Last year's cash flow was, if you compare that to the year before, it was very strong cash flows. And we're working through getting some good improvements in working capital balances.", "So this year I think on the receivable side, we've seen good revenue growth. So that's been driving on the receivables. And working capital \u2013 working balances around inventories and so on just looking to really rebuild through with a lot of new product launches and so on has been happening. So, yeah, I think it's sort of a little bit of a building in working capital level what was a pretty low base I guess the year before.", "So not too much there. The underlying earnings are pretty strong. It's just a matter of keeping on top of working capital balances really. If we do that, we'll draw some good cash flow. So good cash flow, but acknowledge it's a little bit lower than where we were last year where we had very strong cash flows.", "J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, J. P.", "Operator", "Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just two quick ones. I'm wondering if you could give us some granularity on your oxygen business in the U.S. and how you're progressing towards the capture of the COPD opportunity. Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Sean. I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead to walk through the market development for our POCs in the U.S. market. And maybe we can talk a little later about where we're going in Europe with that. But I think for this quarter let's focus on the U.S.", "James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.", "We think the POC business is off to a solid start in our hands. We've made some solid improvements to that product line. There's an ongoing shift away from canister oxygen to other delivery methods, including especially portable methods, like POCs. So the demand in the market remains strong. And we think that there's tremendous upside in that market as we continue to develop the product, make it a resonant product and bring connectivity to it. So we're very bullish on the outlook for that business.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the COPD and vents, any commentary there, Mick?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, look, clearly, COPD is a huge market development opportunity for us globally. 200 million patients worldwide, many of them in some of our high-growth markets. As we start to grow particularly our China and India business, COPD will be a major play for that. I think in those fast-growing markets to avoid some of the sick care system where COPD patients get really sick and then appear at the hospital on a regular basis within many Western European countries that we're working on keeping them out of hospital with our cloud-connected devices. We can reestablish models of out-of-hospital care for those patients.", "So in developing markets or fast-growing markets, like China and India, about setting up systems that avoid the current sick care hospital care system in some of the Western world. But then within the Western world, it's about looking at things differently, trying to find ways to use connected care to predict when patients may have exacerbations and have through chronic disease management physician or nurse practitioner contact with a patient to prevent a hospitalization. We think that's a huge opportunity in the long term and something that we're absolutely focused on.", "And in the short to medium term, we have home health, hospice and home nursing capabilities within Brightree and beyond in the ecosystem which we think can be leveraged to help keep those patients out of the hospital, too. So almost three phases of COPD growth. One in the fast-growing areas of China, India, Eastern Europe developing new models. Two, doubling down on our chronic disease management and connected care play for COPD. And three, some longer-term models to leverage our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service capabilities.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Great. Thank you, Mick. That's all I have.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Sean.", "Operator", "David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much. Mick, if I could start with the travel CPAP. Clearly, it's just being launched in the coming quarter. But could you talk about how big you think that opportunity could be?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, David. I'll start with this and I'll maybe hand off to Jim because the primary first marketed launch will be in the United States, where there's strong demand for this. ResMed's been in business for 28 years next month. And I've worked at the company for 17 years. And almost every time I've talked to a patient, they've asked me, when is ResMed coming up with a travel CPAP solution? I've seen the stuff out there, but it's not what I want. I want ResMed quality. And we spent a long time making sure we could miniaturize this right and that we could get humidification technology miniaturized and able to be used on the go and we could link it to the world's best masks and housings (56:32). And we got there.", "And I've been personally using this ResMed AirMini for 12 months and it's totally changed my travel life, whether I'm on a plane, in a hotel. Wherever I am, I get AutoSet, I get humidification and I get my Nasal Pillows, my P10 with me. And so right at the moment, to your question around sizing, it's a small niche. It's sub-1% of the device market niche. We think we can grow it very significant multiples of where it is now. And we think ResMed can have a very strong share in that with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, best connected, best humidified product in the category.", "Having said all that, we're in controlled product launch. I'm obviously very excited about the opportunity as a patient and a user. But I'm also excited as a business manager for where this could go.", "Jim, any further thoughts about AirMini and how it can grow the category?", "James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Mick. I think it's actually difficult to predict how big the market can be based upon the current market. We think that the market is underserved. We know there's pent-up demand. And Mick referred to this earlier; there are millions of patients who are on CPAP therapy. The average CPAP patient, according to our research, takes four trips a year. So there's millions of people who are traveling. Half of them tell us they don't take their CPAP with them because it's too inconvenient. And so that's millions of potential patients who are looking for a solution. But what they're waiting for is a solution that's a ResMed quality solution.", "And we feel very confident in the AirMini offering. It's not only a terrific, small, in-your-pocket AutoSet, it comes with our best and latest masks with inline waterless humidification, so when you're traveling you don't have to mess around with water. You don't have to worry about finding distilled water and those things that patients have to do. And it's managed. It has a simple on/off button, so it can be managed without anything but an on/off for the patient. But it's also managed and reports out data to an app that is based on our very successful myAir app. And so the patient can look at their own data, can manage their own therapy, et cetera, in that app.", "So it is a completely next-generation offer from a travel PAP point of view. And as Mick said, one of the most frequent questions I'm asked is, when are you guys coming out with a travel PAP? So we think there's big demand. It's hard to predict, but we're excited about it.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks very much. And just my other question just on the masks. The 9% growth was a good outcome, given some of the feedback we had about them and the commentary from yourselves that the products were in backorder. Do you have any sense as to what those numbers could have been if you hadn't been on backorder? How big of a drag was the back order on the growth rate?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "It's really difficult to predict exactly what that 9% number could have been if we had had no backorder. I know it would have been above 9%. So it's 10%-plus. Hard to predict exactly what it was because we weren't able to ship those products. I do think it's a huge opportunity for us as we go into Q4 to get supply ahead of demand. You never want to be behind. But of all of the problems to have, it's probably one of the better ones.", "But we don't even want to have that problem, so we're going to eliminate that here in Q4. And then as we go throughout 2018, we'll be completely supply unconstrained and be able to meet every piece of demand for the N20 and F20. And as I said earlier, we're really excited about the technology InfinitySeal and broad fit range and its capability to get to patients there.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "I think we are now at the 60-minute mark, so I'll probably hand back to Agnes. Oh, okay. I'll just close up. All right. Thanks. So, in closing, I want to thank the more than 5,000 strong ResMed team as they've been diligently driving execution of the N20 and F20 launches and the exciting launch of the ResMed AirMini, as well as our future pipeline of innovative products. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients. We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020.", "I want to thank the global ResMed team. And we're really excited about the future innovations and strategies for what we can do with connected care and digital health for 2025 and beyond. Thank you and we'll talk to you in 90 days.", "I'm going to hand over to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thank you again for joining us today.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mariama, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thank you, Mariama, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the SEC.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. For the call today, I will review top level financial results. I will then review some geographic highlights and discuss a few key announcements this quarter. Finally, I will hand over to Brett who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.", "We achieved solid high single-digit global revenue growth this quarter, led by sales of our sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems and software solutions. At the bottom line, on a non-GAAP basis, our diluted earnings per share was $0.77.", "We have passed the one-year mark since the closing of our Brightree acquisition. That acquisition has been a significant success for homecare customers, for patients and for shareholders. This quarter, we acquired new capabilities and technologies to add to our Brightree offering with two tuck-in acquisitions that I will go into further detail on later on in the call.", "We're making great progress with Brightree as we expand our connected care offering for all of our customers, lowering costs and freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested for even better patient care. I'll discuss more details of our digital health and connected care strategy later in my remarks.", "We have refined our operating model at ResMed to ensure a direct line from customer insights through upstream marketing through our product and solution development teams and also a direct line back down to the sales interface within each of our vertical businesses.", "You can think of this as a merging of what were regional sales structures into global business units. We now have a global sleep business vertical, a global respiratory care business vertical and a global Software-as-a-Service business vertical. We have also maintained a direct line from Rob and me to our Asia growth markets business and our Germany healthcare business due to the unique go-to-market models of these two businesses.", "With this refined operating model, we will not only improve our innovation generation capability, we will also be able to scale more efficiently and provide better SG&A leverage, as we grow towards our 2020 financial and strategic goals.", "Now, for some geographic highlights of the business. The Americas sales teams achieved solid revenue growth at 8% year-on-year, or 6% excluding Brightree. These results were fueled by solid growth in devices as well as low double-digit software sales growth.", "Sleep apnea patient volume is growing steadily. We launched the world's smallest CPAP, which is now my favorite business travel companion, called the AirMini. Since its launch around mid-May, the AirMini is achieving good early adoption in its product category of small, second-use, travel-friendly, cash-pay CPAP and APAP devices. I'll talk about AirMini in more detail a little later.", "Growth in devices in the Americas geography was a solid 8% for the quarter. We continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find value from AirView software and our fast-growing patient engagement app called myAir. We now have over 5 million patients in AirView and over 3 million patients monitored daily with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes. We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms in the U.S., led by the Astral cloud-connected life-support ventilator.", "The masks and accessories category grew 4% in the Americas geography this quarter. As we noted on our call 90 days ago, we expected to have mask supply constraints throughout the first half of the quarter and to get our manufacturing sufficiently ramped up so that we would be ahead of demand and have supply ahead of demand by June. We did just that. However, we clearly missed out on some perishable mask sales of product in April and May, while the N20 and F20 were in limited availability.", "Now, we have supply solidified and we can instill importantly full confidence in our sales force that when they make a sale, we can deliver the N20 and F20 products to fulfill that commitment.", "We are now set to increase sales growth in masks for FY 2018, as we unleash our sales force with these excellent products and full supply. In terms of customer feedback on the N20 and F20, it remains very positive. The 97% plus fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal technology provide a very long runway of growth throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond.", "Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our European and Asia geographies. Device sales in the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 11% this quarter on a constant currency basis. Growth was particularly strong in France, the UK, Japan as well as Australia, New Zealand. It is worth noting that reimbursement for telemonitoring has been approved now in France. This has provided and will provide on an ongoing basis increased adoption of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms.", "Digital health and connected care are going global, and ResMed is a catalyst for that. We have had excellent success with connected care value creation for our U.S. customers these last three-plus years, and we expect to continue that. But now we also expect to provide similar value creation from connected care for our customers in Europe and across Asia Pacific as we expand this offering. We also achieved solid growth in our dental business in Europe with the Narval mandibular repositioning device.", "Masks and accessories grew at 4% this quarter in combined Europe and Asia geographies. Similar to the U.S. commentary, we expect this growth to expand in FY 2018 based on the positive feedback from patients, physicians and homecare providers. Customers in Europe and Asia are also excited by the broad fit range and enhanced comfort of the AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20.", "Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 growth strategy and then I'll hand the call over to Brett.", "In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we're making significant advances with the smallest, the quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care. We launched our new AirTouch full face mask in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The AirTouch UltraSoft memory foam cushion is a breakthrough in the treatment of sleep apnea.", "AirTouch is the softest CPAP mask in ResMed's history. It is a significant innovation that is truly novel and very patient-friendly. This mask addresses the number one reason that patients quit CPAP therapy, which is comfort. The UltraSoft memory foam is permeable, allowing heat and moisture to escape without compromising therapy pressure. The AirTouch foam mask cushion also fits into the AirFit F20 frame, giving our homecare customers interchange and switch options as they fit patients and help patients better adhere to CPAP therapy.", "As we discussed earlier, we started shipping the world's smallest CPAP midway through May. It is still very early days, but we have had excellent initial demand for the AirMini and we are expanding and leading in this new niche product category. There is solid demand for a category of small travel-friendly, second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. You will hear more from us as we build this category and drive growth with AirMini.", "We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our growth strategy. This quarter, we announced two tuck-in acquisitions within the Brightree product portfolio that enhance existing Brightree modules and address customer pain points for order intake and opportunities in resupply.", "The first acquisition of a technology called Conduit Office is the technology behind a Brightree module called MyForms. This technology will allow us to enhance MyForms as a leading documentation and workflow management solution. MyForms provides automation to help improve the order intake process of our homecare customers. The net result is reduced claim denials and improved audit outcomes for our homecare customers.", "The second tuck-in acquisition is a company called AllCall Connect. This acquisition provides a full-featured live call center for homecare customers who subscribed to Brightree Connect, one of our resupply offerings. It can be expensive and sometimes inefficient for homecare customers to develop their own in-house live calling resupply capability. However, we know from our research that regular CPAP mask and accessory replacement are critical to ensure ongoing patient comfort, fit and adherence to CPAP therapy. AllCall Connect allows us to provide this service to our customers.", "On the big data to actionable information fronts, a new study was presented at the American Thoracic Society Conference in May. This ResMed-sponsored study of over 130,000 patients on PAP therapy showed that patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, or CSA, are two times more likely to terminate therapy. This study highlights the importance of monitoring patients to support adherence.", "Also, it shows that early diagnosis of CSA and use of therapy such as ResMed's ASV technology may minimize risk of therapy non-adherence. The de-identified aggregated propensity matched data in the study leverage the more than 1 billion nights of sleep data in our connected care digital health ecosystem.", "With our new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Carlos Nunez, partnering with global teams of researchers in digital health, we predict that the insights gained from studies like this and beyond will provide the opportunity for ResMed and our partners to advance the field of sleep medicine faster than ever before.", "Moving to the second horizon of our ResMed 2020 growth strategy, our cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators and life-support ventilators continue to grow globally, and we continue to develop our connected care strategy within COPD. The Journal of Global Health estimates that there are over 380 million patients worldwide suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", "With COPD being the number three cause of death and the number two cause for re-hospitalization, we are focused on testing and driving models that lower costs and improve outcomes for COPD patients. This is an urgent need to address a growing public health crisis.", "On the clinical front, a study using a combination of home oxygen therapy and home mechanical ventilation, a study known as HOT-HMV was published in the Journal of American Medical Association, or JAMA. This ResMed-sponsored study was presented at the American Thoracic Society in May was previously presented at ERS. The conclusion of the study is that patients who receive non-invasive ventilation at home, in addition to oxygen therapy at home, had a 51% decrease in the risk of re-hospitalization or death.", "This major finding is now published in a peer-reviewed press and a top tier journal. This is an important milestone. HOT-HMV contributes to a growing body of evidence, supporting the broader use of non-invasive ventilation, such as ResMed's AirCurve 10 platform as an important treatment for patients with COPD.", "We are excited that we now have our global respiratory care business vertical, including direct line of sight from management down to the sales interface. This augers well for better leverage of studies like HOT-HMV to drive the changes in standard of care and drive further growth of non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator and life support ventilation businesses.", "Our third horizon of growth includes a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service business models. We are working with payers and providers to develop and enhance chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination models as well as to acquire and grow Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice verticals.", "We made progress during the quarter in this area with Brightree's new offering for the home health and hospice market. Our solution called OASIS, which stands for Outcome and Assessment Information Set. This is an integrated software and service solution with Brightree's coding and billing service that helps home health and hospice agencies reduce errors, improve patient care and optimize reimbursement, saving time so that they can focus on patients. This continues to be an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our software offerings.", "Let me close with this. We are incredibly excited about our new product launches this last fiscal year and during the quarter with the N20, the F20, AirTouch full face masks, and world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini. We are well positioned for fiscal year 2018 and we continue to work on a pipeline of new products and connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD, neuromuscular disease and other clinical adjacencies. We are positioning the company for long-term growth for 2020 and well beyond, as we refine our operating model, better enabling customer insights to power our product and service solutions teams developments and then drive even better sales execution. We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefits of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks, and we will go to Q&A after that. Over to you, Brett.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. As Mick noted, we had a solid quarter. Group revenue for the June quarter was $556.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 8%.", "Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $314 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $206.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 9% over the prior-year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments, Americas device sales were $174.4 million, an increase of 8% over the prior-year quarter. Masks and other sales were $139.6 million, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific device sales were $145.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 11%.", "Masks and other sales were $61.1 million, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, an increase of 4%. Globally in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9% while masks and other increased by 4% over the prior-year quarter. Brightree revenue for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million, with growth on a prior-year comparable basis continuing to track in the low double-digits.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP numbers in the current quarter adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. In the prior-year comparables, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, Brightree onetime deferred revenue fair value adjustment, SERVE-HF accrual release and the cumulative tax benefit associated with the adoption of Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. We have provided a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our fourth quarter earnings press release.", "Our gross margin for the June quarter was 58.2%, consistent on a year-over-year basis. This reflects manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, offset by declines in average selling prices and changes in product mix. Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin in fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q4 FY 2017 gross margin.", "Moving on to operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $147.9 million, an increase of 10% over the prior-year quarter, or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 11%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% compared to the 25.8% that we reported last year.", "Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect the SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to improve from around 27% at the beginning of the fiscal year to around 26% by the end of the fiscal year.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $36.7 million, an increase of 7% over the prior-year quarter, or on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.6%, consistent with the prior year. Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% to 8% for fiscal year 2018. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, a decrease of $900,000 over the prior year. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.7 million.", "Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $139.1 million, an increase of 3% over the prior-year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $109.6 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.77, an increase of 4% over the prior-year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.71.", "Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted fourth quarter earnings by $0.03 per share, reflecting the unfavorable impacts from the weaker euro and stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.", "On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.8% and for the fiscal year 2017, it was 20%.The current quarter effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of $2.2 million (23:03) share-based payment transactions recorded in accordance with Accounting Standard ASU 2016-09. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the vicinity of 22%.", "Cash flow from operations was $140.3 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and only a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $18.4 million while depreciation and amortization for the June quarter totaled $28.2 million.", "Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, an increase of 6% over the previous quarterly dividend. As previously announced, we have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to recent acquisitions. However, we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually.", "At June 30, we have $1.1 billion in gross debt and $257 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At June 30, total assets were $3.5 billion and net equity was $2 billion.", "And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.", "Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. This is actually Scott on for Margaret. I wanted to start on the U.S. market growth for both devices and masks. Mick, should we look at device growth on a six-month basis or is underlying device growth accelerating in the U.S.? And then on masks, how do that underlying market growth compare to last quarter and Q4?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Scott. In terms of market growth, look, I think it's always good to look at a 6-month or even 12-month trailing period because there's lots of sort of fluctuations that could happen on a quarterly basis, seasonally adjusted and aspects of how the market might turn. In general, we look at the market as mid to high single-digits growth for the market and devices are at the low end of that range and masks are at the high end of that range. At ResMed, we like to not just meet, but beat market growth rates and I'd say if you look at this quarter completely we beat market growth rates with our device growth, and we're a little behind it on our mask growth rate given some of the supply constraints in the first half of the quarter. But the market growth rate I think it is good to look at a 6 or 12-month trailing period to sort of get a better picture of what the market growth is.", "Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. And then, Brett, I wanted to ask on gross margin in the quarter and then the puts and takes for that number in terms of currency and mix and pricing and you guys guided to a gross margin for the next fiscal year to be consistent with this quarter. The same kind of question in terms of headwinds and tailwinds concerning you guys have probably had a pretty strong mask growth rate throughout the year.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, as you said, Scott, lots of puts and takes on that. But, I guess, the margins if you look at our last few quarters is relatively stable in that sense and we're seeing certainly sort of moderation and that product mix impact is still there, a little bit negative. We had really strong device growth. So, obviously, if device is growing more strongly than mask, then you have a slightly negative impact on margins. But to the extent we see some improvement in that mask growth for FY 2018 then that would certainly be supportive of product mix and supportive of the gross margin.", "Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then lastly for Mick, kind of a bigger picture question on AirMini. Could this potentially be something you push as more of a mainstream product or something you would consider investing DTC advertising dollars towards or are you guys just going to rely on kind of your traditional customers to promote the product themselves? Thanks.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks for the question, Scott. Look, the AirMini is a really exciting product and it's the world's smallest CPAP, but it is designed to be a second-use, cash-pay, travel-friendly device, and that's sort of the niche segment, category, if you like, that it's creating and growing and leading. We've seen great initial demand in the U.S. through our home care channel, as they get the opportunity to enhance their cash sales and in markets around the world where there are other go-to-market models, patients are willing to pay out of pocket. And I think there was some good pent-up demand for a travel-friendly CPAP like this and we look forward to expanding that niche category to a larger niche and continuing to lead it and the AirMini technology is doing a great job now.", "Scott R. Schaper - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my question. Just to re-ask the question, Brett, on gross margin. If the masks are as good as what the feedback suggests, I'm not really sure why we don't really see a meaningful tick up in mask growth and, therefore, why wouldn't we see some upward pressure on gross margin?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Well, really, in that sense, we (29:30) and, I guess, what I'm saying at the moment, it's broadly consistent. We're still seeing some pretty good device growth. Again, we expect to see better growth in masks than what we saw this quarter. And to the extent we see that coming through then I'll update gross margin guidance in a dynamic way. So we'll still continue to update as we go and it's the same story. If we get, say, acceleration in mask then you will see some improvement in gross margin. But we're still doing pretty well in devices also. And year-on-year, we had a few \u2013 if you look at that with the FX and things like that year-on-year, it was a little bit of headwind for us as well. So, there's few things playing out on that but the thesis still hold. If we get good mask growth then you'll see an improvement in product mix and improvement in gross margin.", "Sean Laaman - Morgan Stanley Australia Ltd.", "Sure. Great, Brett, and thanks for taking my question. That's all I have. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, feel free to re-enter the queue. David Low from JPMorgan is on line with a question.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much. If we could just touch on the device growth. As you say, there is a good strong results there. Just wondering if you could give us some sense as the what sort of contribution you saw from the non-invasive ventilation line, if it was that growing strongly and was the AirMini device much of a contributor to that line, please?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Hi, David. It's Mick here. As you know, we don't split out respiratory care device growth versus sleep device growth at this point. But, look, what I can say qualitatively is that the vast majority of that growth was the sleep apnea device growth powered by the AirView software solution and uptake of the great value for physicians and providers from AirView. But that is as we move connected care to our respiratory care platform, that is starting to get some momentum there.", "I will say that AirMini coming out the gates was relatively minimal on its impact on the aggregate device growth because that niche is really just starting up, but there was some balance between sleep apnea and respiratory care growth, but heavily weighted towards sleep apnea device growth, particularly in the U.S. region in terms of the year-on-year growth rate.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks. And sorry, just a related question. The French change, the telemonitoring, was that meaningful in this quarter or is that something that's likely to become more of a contributor going forward?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, it's more of an ongoing contributor. It will have some influence on product selection by customers as they are looking to make purchases during those 90 days, but that changes \u2013 something that is actually changing the fundamental basis of competition, if you like, in the industry in France and it's an ongoing opportunity for us to drive AirSense, AirCurve, and really the whole Air Solutions ecosystem, particularly the software side of AirView and we're seeing the French physicians really embracing the technology and we're seeing French customers really liking the efficiencies that they can get from the technology. And we're looking forward to patients getting the ability in France to get access to myAir data and at the same levels that the patients throughout the U.S. have these last three or four years and we think the value across that whole ecosystem of customers will be strong. So the short answer is, it's an ongoing thing and it did impact a little bit in the quarter, but it'll be ongoing for FY 2018 and beyond.", "David A. Low - JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is on line with a question.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I would check regarding just the Brightree commentary in terms of growth. If I go back to the 4Q 2016 period and just look at the revenues there, it looks like the implied growth was about 25% this quarter. Can you just clarify whether that was the case and was there any contribution from some of those tuck-in acquisitions you made? Thanks.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, Saul, that's rightly said. It was a little bit complicated last year with the fair value adjustments that we had from Brightree around the acquisition and on revenue side. And I see it like it was a slightly shorter quarter. So what I've done in \u2013 what I said for that is really an underlying prudent comparable growth rate. If you look at like-for-like just on the numbers that we've got in our filings, for example, you're exactly right, it's around that 25%. But if you look at it on a pure comparable basis so I would try to (34:20) strip out some of those sort of adjustments then we're looking at that pretty solid low double-digit growth.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.", "Thanks, Brett. And can I just ask one additional question about the impact of currency for fiscal 2018 on gross margin in terms of the way currency stands at the moment, is there a net benefit coming through this fiscal year based on what the euro has done versus the USD, or is that effectively offset by the rise in the Aussie dollar on the COGS side? Thanks.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, you're right. If I have a look \u2013 just to give you a sense for it, if I look at \u2013 currencies are moving around a lot lately as you'd be aware. But if I look at it going into \u2013 sequentially going into Q1, then I think we get a benefit of some currency for that at the moment, I think we're looking to get a benefit of maybe sort of that 20 to 30 basis points. But then if I take it into Q2 where we then start to pick up some of the impact from the appreciating Aussie dollar, it basically reverses that, so basically roughly 40 basis point reversal. That's a little bit of a tailwind sequentially going in Q1 that then turns into a small headwind into Q2. And then going forward, that should then just sort of flatten out. But if you look at it sequentially that impact is better in Q1, but then a worse impact in Q2 for us. And that's really driven off that pretty sharp increase in the Aussie dollar, which just happened quite recently. And then we'll see where that heads. But at the moment, that's the impacts that we're looking at.", "Saul Hadassin - Credit Suisse (Australia) Ltd.", "That's great. Thanks very much, Brett.", "Operator", "Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is on line with a question.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good evening. Can you hear me okay?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "We can hear you fine, Joanne.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Terrific. Two questions. The first one is it's great to hear that you're out of supply constraint on the masks and the accessories or the two new mask items. Can you give us an idea of where do you go from here with full supply? What kind of demand that you're seeing for those products?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Look, I think the demand is high and physicians like it because of its broad fit range. Technicians like it because \u2013 most importantly, patients like it. And it has a good first-time fit ratio and a very broad fit range of 97%, one of them 99% on the other. And the InfinitySeal comfort technology just having very light levels of plastic around the bridge of the nose is very comfortable for patients. So, yeah, we missed some perishable sales in the first half of the quarter due to supply constraints. That goes away in Q1, right. As we look forward to FY 2018, our sales force confidence will really be there and I think that's a product that you shouldn't underestimate that when salespeople are in short supply, they don't sell that product line. And when they aren't short-supplied, they can sell that product line. So, as we look forward to FY 2018, we think there will be some very good success of the N20 and F20 and really happy to let that sales team do what they do best, which is provide (37:38) customers in a way that they can help give it to their customers or (37:41) the patients.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Is there a way to quantify those lost perishable sales?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "There are probably 20 different models that we have internally. But it's not something we talk about externally. It's certainly something that \u2013 as we said 90 days ago, we never like to be under supply constraints. With innovation, new technologies, new plastics, new ways of designing single cushion masks that revolutionize the market, we had some challenges with the technology there last quarter. But the good news is we are through that. As we look forward, we're looking to continue growth and particularly growth in masks.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Excellent. And then my second question really is, is operating margins. They compressed year-over-year on higher SG&A. Do you see sort of this new annual run rate as a steady state or should we start moving up from here with the higher mask margins?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, on operating margins, Joanne, yeah, I mean, we've guided to be broadly consistent on the gross margin. We set (38:46) that around how do we get through FY 2018 improving that mask growth and so on, that's going to be supportive for gross margin.", "Then on the operating margin side, we expect that we'll get some moderation in those SG&A growth rates. Things such as legal costs and so on have been hurting us through FY 2017. As we work through FY 2018, we're focused on driving some operating leverage and we expect to improve that over the course of FY 2018. And to the extent we do that then that will drop through to the bottom line.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "What I'd add to that I think is, as we look to drive operating leverage on a longer-term basis and moderate SG&A as a percentage of revenue, I think we can get more aggressive in how we scale our business. And as I said in the prepared remarks, Joanne, we've refined our operating model with business verticals that include the sales force and downstream marketing teams in region and in countries. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to grow revenue significantly faster than we grow our SG&A as we look forward to 2020 and well beyond. So, short term, I agree with Brett, we got some refinements and great capability to drive operating leverage, but longer term it could be even better.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Terrific. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Will Dunlop from Bank of America is on line with a question.", "William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Well, thanks very much. Just again wanted to ask about the gross margin and perhaps why you didn't provide a range for the guidance, that guidance seems quite specific even that there is probably quite a bit of variability in the product mix that could occur \u2013 a geographic mix that could occur throughout fiscal 2018.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "You're right, Will. There's always going to be variabilities. There're a number of factors that play out. Obviously, we mentioned a few of them but you've got the interplay of ASP, procurement/manufacturing improvements, FX, product mix, geographic mix, there's a bunch of factors that play out on that, so that is difficult to predict, I guess. But I think broadly consistent. That easily you can see that is being not \u2013 don't think of that as being like purely consistent. But I think you could argue that's a bit of a range anyway around where we're at. So it certainly can be \u2013 and we've talked about it already on improvement in mask and so on conveying that we can get some expansion in gross margin. So I didn't mean that to be a really precise measure of guidance. I think it could range around that 58.2% as well.", "William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks. And secondly, just on the SG&A as a percentage of sales guided to be declining through fiscal 2018. Is that because you expect litigation costs to roll off? And if not, are they going to be a material component of SG&A for fiscal 2018?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Well, we still have litigation costs and that will still be coming through FY 2018, but we didn't ramp up through FY 2017, I guess, and that was hurting our growth rate on SG&A. We do think \u2013 in terms of litigations, hard to predict exactly where that will end up, but I think it will be not sort of accelerating in terms of our growth from where we were in FY 2017. But we'll continue to be spending money on legal expenses around litigation. But it'll be \u2013 I think it's more broader than that in terms of moderating the SG&A growth rate, so it's not just about legal cost leveling out or going down or whatever that might be. It will be more broad-based than that.", "And I should say that guidance as well is notwithstanding pretty sharp appreciation in the Australian dollar, which \u2013 we got a lot of operating costs in Australian dollars, so we're going to deal with that as well. So, obviously, that's going to be a little bit of a headwind through FY 2018, but we remain confident that we can moderate the SG&A growth through FY 2018 notwithstanding currency impacts.", "William Dunlop - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Andrew Goodsall from UBS is on line with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "Thanks very much for taking my call. I'm just coming back to (43:10) across the quarter particularly with masks, I know you've belabored this a little bit or were belabored a bit. Just trying to sort of understand when the back order came off and when we look at that mask number, we're sort of looking at really a sort of one-month effect of kind of full availability and, I guess, just trying to understand the exit rate to give us some confidence around 2018?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, Andrew. So, as I said, we were supply constrained through well beyond halfway through the quarter. So you can sort of look at it as, yes, (43:38) four to five weeks of the supply constrains starting to go away SKU by SKU and us getting supply ahead of demand. I think the fact that I talked a little bit to earlier, Joanne's question with regard to sales force having full confidence that they're going to have supply, that's not binary. You don't just go Monday morning and say we got full supply and the sales force say it's fantastic, I'm going to go and sell a truckload of F20s. I think what it takes is some time and they make some small orders and make sure it comes through and then ramp up because intelligent sales people with very good relationships with their customers and they want to fulfill those relationships with when they make a sale that we can deliver the order.", "I think what we've shown in the last four-plus weeks in the quarter is that we were able to deliver on all those sales. And so I think the exit rate from Q4 was very strong from our team in terms of what we're able to provide to customers for N20 and F20. And I expect that to continue very strongly in Q1 and throughout FY 2018, as we are completely supplying non-constrained and the sales force can be really out there driving the full bag of products that ResMed has for our customers, which is a really strong portfolio right now.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "All right. That's great to hear that exit rate. Then I guess maybe without answering my own question, I guess, just obviously the UltraSoft does have a pretty intense replenishment schedule or monthly (45:05) I guess it's fair to say no real effect of that in this quarter, I mean, that sounds like it's sort of a next quarter event?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, the AirTouch range with the foam masks does have a faster replacement cycle. It's incredibly comfortable. Heat and moisture can be removed, but air pressure stays high, but it does have a fast replacement cycle. Yeah, I mean, we've really started launching that mid-May and so you've got very little, if any, replacement cycles on the AirTouch. And that whole category of a foam mask with a different replacement cycle in terms of comfort is really a category that we're developing over time. I don't know, Jim, the Head of our Sleep business and running the Americas last quarter, you want to give any further insights to AirTouch?", "James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, I think we're confident on all three masks. The F20 and the N20 are both on great trajectories and now that we're off supply constraint, we're very confident in forward growth and in Q1 and throughout the year. AirTouch would start later, launch later. It's getting fantastic reviews from both physicians and patients. And, again, you're absolutely right. We're not yet really into it didn't launch early enough for us to see any real impact of resupply on the cushions in the quarter.", "Andrew Goodsall - UBS Securities Australia Ltd.", "That's great. Thank you very much.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is on line with a question.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. Hi. Just a question on Brightree. We haven't had an update in the gross margin of that business since you first acquired it and I just wonder how that might look today particularly in light of some of the acquisitions that you've made.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Sure, Steve. It's Brett. Yeah, I mean, look, it's pretty consistent with those that we disclosed at the time we made the acquisition. So there's really no material difference on those margins. We got a couple \u2013 these are kind of like small tuck-in acquisitions, I guess. They're sort of not enough to move in any significant way the operating margins of Brightree so they've been pretty consistent through that period since acquisition.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. Okay. And then just with the R&D guidance, that looks like it's stepping up a bit in 2018. Is there anything you can talk to on the R&D front that might be driving that other than currency?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Well, currency is pretty big one. So, I mean, the two things is we'll continue to invest in R&D, so we're going to continue to do that. So we'll continue to grow our investment base. And the second one that's probably hurting us a bit on that, on the guidance or \u2013 basically I'm looking at 7% to 8% is really the uptick, I'm looking at this Aussie dollar, a lot of our R&D is still (48:06) in the Australian dollars. So that's (48:10) if I look at the forecast, that's hurt us a bit on the R&D \u2013 just in R&D in terms of the U.S. dollars. So those two factors have led us to guide around that 7% to 8% mark for FY 2018.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Yeah. Okay. And then just one other. Could you just give a bit more color around the effective tax rate? It's just even without the change around the Accounting Standard, it looks a lot lower than what I was expecting. Yeah, if you could just address that, that will be great.", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Overall for the year, Steve \u2013 the quarter's a bit hard because anything you do in terms of the year-end calculation of tax, everything gets sort of trued up (48:55) gets concentrated into the last quarter. But if you look at full year, we're around 20%, and that was probably helped a little bit by the ASU 2016-09 Accounting Standard. So that sort of contributed a little bit there. Perhaps underlying it's more like 21% or something like that. So that's sort of where we landed at an underlying rate. If we look at it going forward, it's just I'd up-tick (49:18) that a little bit but just looking forward around the geographic distribution of taxable income is the fact our (49:26) stronger Australian dollar is going to be a factor on that, at least also contributing a little bit. And there're a few other things, such as the R&D tax concession in Australia, which is capped at $100 million, has reduced from 40% to 38.5%. So, a number of those factors that's sort of playing out on the tax rate and has led us to increase that just a little bit from where we were in FY 2017.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "Great. Well, can I just ask one more? Just the other income line that reverses from a profit to a loss. Was that just hedging, or was there anything else in there?", "Brett A. Sandercock - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, that's predominantly FX losses through hedging.", "Steve Wheen - Evans & Partners Pty Ltd.", "All right. Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.", "Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research", "Yeah. Thanks very much. Look, I just wanted to ask about the portable oxygen concentrator business. (50:28) is that hasn't sort of grown, been a little disappointing. But what's your take on where that business is going and how you can really drive growth there, little pockets of opportunity?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, Vic, I'll hand that to Rob Douglas to talk about POCs.", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Victor. Victor, we've continued to work hard on the Activox product and we've actually made a number of improvements under the hood, so to say, of the device. And we've seen a lot of improved performance. And we think our teams have done a great job on that improved performance, and now we're just getting that through to the customer base.", "But we're not re-branding yet. We're still waiting for further improvements that we think and we're happy with the device as \u2013 when ResMed puts its brand on it. So today, we're still work in progress, we're making very good progress. The Activox unit remains a very good, very long battery life device, and our teams are promoting it appropriately to key customers. So we're in it for the long haul and we believe it's going to be a very good business.", "Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research", "Okay. And then do you think, in terms of a ResMed branded product, you're well down the path in terms of development of that, Rob, or is that something (51:54)?", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Victor, one of the things we've learned over the years is we really can't forecast our R&D program, it's just too good for competitors and everyone like that, so we're really reluctant to give you a timeline and details on that.", "Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research", "Yeah. Okay. And does this form part of this new \u2013 it sounds like you're sort of doing a slight reorganization in terms of the operations with the new business verticals. Is this presumably this falls into the respiratory care part of that business, is that right?", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. Victor, we've got a very strong respiratory care team that's able to focus on getting at and treating patients with respiratory insufficiency, the COPD is one of the main patient conditions that we're aiming to treat. We've got an improving and an emerging portfolio of treatment options there. We'll be building more of them. As Mick mentioned earlier, we've really generated lines of business where we've got much closer engagement between our sales organization and our customers back through to our R&D teams. We should, over time, see benefits on the R&D programs for that.", "Victor Windeyer - Citi Investment Research", "Yeah. Okay. All right. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. First one I wanted to ask was just about the acquisitions and other tuck-ins, but could you help us understand whether there was any contribution in the quarter and what you're expecting from those in terms of contribution in the next fiscal year?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Matt. No, there was de minimis contributions in Q4 from those tuck-in acquisitions. They were really about technologies that will enhance our ongoing future growth of the Brightree offering. So, to maintain and grow that double-digit growth of high-margin business in Software-as-a-Service, we're finding tuck-ins of some good technologies can really help enhance that growth and drive further value for our customers.", "So, AllCall Connect, I met the team, they're actually with me up in Halifax with our Healthcare Informatics team, straight after the acquisition already engaged with our software development teams and really starting to say, well, how do we link this tuck-in technology with all the great offerings we currently have on Brightree and continue to provide that value as we go forward. So, the short answer is no contribution Q4 2017. We'll expect great contributions as that capability of AllCall and Conduit Office roll into the offerings from Brightree, some particular modules that will expand over FY 2018, FY 2019 and beyond.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And just a question on leverage. If I look at the guidance quite literally, it would imply slight negative leverage in fiscal 2018. I know you have a headwind from foreign exchange, but what are the other headwinds that you have that maybe we're not thinking about and how can you get more leverage out of the business as you continue to grow the top line?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, Matt, look, it's a great question and clearly we are looking for operating leverage. And you can't control things like FX and those just have to be budgeted where they are now. Well, where they will be, who knows, but we will see as those move. But the things you can control, your SG&A growth, your R&D growth, your investments across your portfolio and how you go to market.", "As I said in the prepared remarks, establishing these new business verticals, rolling sales into global businesses, we think there is a lot of efficiency we can gain here in how we grow revenues significantly faster than growing SG&A while providing the same or even better value to customers. So it's something that we are laser-focused on in terms of operating leverage, getting SG&A leverage and driving that growth.", "We're not going to grind our R&D dollars and not invest in innovation, I mean, that's something we're going to continue to invest at a very strong rate. Brett put that sort of 7% plus guidance in there and FX might tick that up to 8%. But SG&A can come down from 27% to 26% and below, because there are great ways to scale marketing through social media and digital marketing. There are great ways to scale our sales force and how we go to market in different countries.", "And so we've got a lot of very exciting plans for the next fiscal year and beyond, in terms of driving our go-to-market strategy that I very strongly believe will drive better operating and SG&A particularly leverage as we grow forward.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is on line with a question.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Two quick ones for me. Maybe just on masks, generally just an update on the pricing environment overall and as you get up to speed with some of the new offerings out of the supply issues, do you expect, perhaps, a little bit of premium pricing on the newer offerings?", "And then maybe, just an update on inventory cycles, receivables, cash, it looks like inventories ticked up a bit as well and just trying to reconcile that with the supply constraints? Thanks, again.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, thanks for the questions, Anthony. I'll hand the first part of the question to Jim Hollingshead to talk about pricing and the second part to Brett.", "James Hollingshead - ResMed, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks, Mick. Hey, Anthony, thanks for the question. What we're seeing is a pretty normal pricing environment relative to historical. And so, we're not seeing any unusual declines in pricing. We're seeing the same steady, moderate annual ASP declines that we generally see historically in the industry.", "All of our mask offerings are priced at a premium. We're the market leader. We're the strongest provider in the industry and we have premium pricing. The new mask themselves also are at a premium to the, well, with the existing portfolio.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "That's helpful.", "Robert Andrew Douglas - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah. And then, Anthony, just on the inventory, some uptick there, but we definitely rebuilding through the supply chain to support the new product introductions and to get us into that good strong supply position. So an element of that is building for that and you see that reflected at June 30 in the inventory balances.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the questions, Anthony.", "Operator", "Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is on line with a question.", "Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.", "Good afternoon, everyone. So, Mick, two questions from my side, first on Brightree, can you quantify the OUS or ex-U.S. opportunity for us?", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Suraj. Yeah, Brightree has been laser-focused on the U.S. HME industry and has an emerging vertical that they're building in home health and hospice. And so, we think the value provided is incredible there. The skill sets, so none of the existing modules, if you like, from Brightree would be copied and pasted into our German business or to our French business. But the capabilities of running a Software-as-a-Service business, getting strong annually recurring revenue, monthly recurring revenue from customers, having them pay for the software per user per month is a very strong capability.", "So, we think that out of hospital Software-as-a-Service capability is an incredible strength that ResMed now has, and we are looking to, as I said in the prepared remarks, expanding home nursing and expanding home health and expanding hospice within the U.S. environment.", "We're also looking to expand our Software-as-a-Service offerings in France and Germany, and the UK, probably not with the direct copy and paste, it's more of a longer-term approach than that. Some things that we are looking to copy and paste and in fact have already started to do that are in the area of the Air Solutions ecosystem, including AirView and myAir.", "So the AirView software for physicians and for homecare providers has already been set up with service based in Europe, according to European law or with European security protocols and in line with the needs of our European customers, so AirView is going there.", "In addition, myAir, the patient app, that's universal, right. Humans are the same no matter where they are. And just translating it into French or into German or into Japanese is the pathway and making sure that we have all the right engagements around local law and security and so on. So, that's where the scale is in AirView and myAir and then the capability longer-term with regard to Brightree.", "Suraj Kalia - Northland Securities, Inc.", "Fair enough. And, Mick, one last question, this might be a na\u00efve question, Mick. So let's say I have to order a resupply or reorder a mask, whether a full face nasal or what may be and let's say that N20 and F20 is not available, what happens to that patient? I guess, I'm just trying to understand if there were supply issues, did those patients stick with their existing masks? Did they go to the N10 or F10 in the interim or if you can just help us reconcile because I'm looking at the 4% Americas mask number. Part of me is like, that the patients \u2013 are they waiting for these new masks to come online or did they switch to N10 and F10? Any color would be great. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Yeah, Suraj, that's a really good question and one thing that we talked about internally when we saw supply constraints was focusing to make sure that we had resupply for customers versus going after a new patient sale. And so, as I said, there were some perishable sales lost in the first half of the quarter of some new patients that we wouldn't have got on to a ResMed mask and the customer will make a choice whether they went to an N10 or F10 or to a competitor's mask, and losing six weeks or eight weeks of first (01:02:15) is a bad thing to do.", "But what's worse is, to your point, not being able to resupply an existing customer. And so we've really worked with our homecare customers to make sure that any resupply needs from \u2013 and the mask had only been out there six to nine months and so it wasn't a huge population resupply but that the supply was focused on resupply of patients who had already loved the N20 and F20, so that we continue to have those patients. Really our homecare customers continue to have those patient supply with ResMed masks for their life and so that was a nuance during the quarter.", "I'd see we're just past the bottom of the hour and so we should probably end the Q&A there, Mariama.", "Operator", "Okay. Thank you. We are now at the one-hour mark. So, I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Michael J. Farrell - ResMed, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. And I guess, I could handle this myself. But thanks Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the now more than 6,000 strong ResMed team, here at ResMed (01:03:14) diligently driving execution of N20, F20, AirTouch and many new launches as well as the future pipeline, and even more innovative products and software solutions that we will launch as we move ahead. Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of tens of millions of patients globally. And we remain laser-focused on our goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. We'll talk to you again in 90 days with our Q1, FY 2018 results. Thank you for your time.", "Agnes Lee - ResMed, Inc.", "Thank you, again, for joining us today.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Agnes Lee, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Agnes, you may begin.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Mariama, and thank you for attending ResMed's live webcast. Joining me on the call today are Mick Farrell, our CEO; and Brett Sandercock, our CFO. Other members of the management team will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website at investor.resmed.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy, integration of acquisitions and performance.", "We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by ResMed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "I will now hand the call over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Agnes and thank you to all of our shareholders that joining us today as we review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. For the call today, I will review top-level financial results. I will then cover some business highlights and discuss some key announcements this quarter. Then I will hand the call over to Brett Sandercock, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.", "We are very grateful to our global team for a very strong performance this quarter. We achieved double-digits global revenue growth led by sales of our software solutions, our mask systems and our sleep apnea devices. At the bottom line, we grew operating profit 12% and our diluted earnings per share was $0.66 on a non-GAAP basis. We are proud of this solid top and bottom line performance from our global ResMed team.", "Brightree\u2019s growth continues to be strong at 15% year-on-year inclusive of tuck-in acquisitions. We are making great progress as we expand our connected care offerings for all of our customers creating efficiencies and improving patient outcomes.", "Now let me cover some geographic business highlights. The U.S., Canada and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth at 11%. These results were fueled by strong growth in devices and masks as well continued double-digit software sales growth. Sleep apnea patient volume continues to grow steadily.", "Growth in devices in these countries was 8% for the quarter. It has been over three years since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions cloud-based software and we continue to grow our device market share as homecare providers and physicians find ongoing sustainable value from our connected care solutions. The masks and accessories category grew 13% in the U.S., Canada and Latin America countries this quarter. We've seen good demand across all mask categories.", "The AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20 masks are performing well and we are able to fully supply the fast growing demand for these products. Our brand new AirTouch F20 is in its very early days and has high patients comfort ratings right out of the gate. Device sales in the combined European and Asian countries were up a very strong 9% this quarter on a constant currency basis.", "ResMed France achieved very strong device growth catalyzed by the announcement of increased reimbursement for telemonitored sleep devices relative to non-cloud connected devices. We expect to continue our connected care value creation for our customers across Europe and Asia Pacific as we expand digital help and connected care globally.", "Across Europe and Asia, our teams achieved strong mask growth of 15% this quarter. We expect ongoing growth based on continued adoption of our recent mask technology and positive customer feedback across the spectrum: patients, physicians and homecare providers.", "I\u2019ll now take a few minutes to update you on our three horizons 2020 growth strategy and then I will hand the call over to Brett. In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products enhanced by digital health and connected care.", "We now have over six million patients monitored with AirView software and over four million patients monitored with 100% cloud connected medical devices on their bedside tables. In addition, we have seen over 1,300 new patients\u2019 signup for the myAir patient engagement app every single day. It turns out consumers love seeing their own data.", "We are expanding globally with our connected care solutions translating the value creation that we have brought to our customers in the U.S. over to France and across Europe and beyond. In September, we featured our recently launched travel CPAP solutions, the ResMed AirMini at the European Respiratory Society Conference in Milan.", "There continues to be the demand and interest for a category of small travel-friendly second-use CPAP devices that patients are willing to buy with their own cash. We are focused on growing this category all around the world with particular success in existing cash pay markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada and the UK.", "This quarter ResMed and Brightree launched another integration solution. Together, we provide a seamless solution for all homecare providers through automated resupply enrollment for patients managed by both Brightree Connect and AirView software. With this enhancement, AirView automatically alerts Brightree Connect once the patient has achieved compliance criteria.", "So that the patients can be automatically enrolled into the Brightree Connect resupply program. This feature helps our homecare customers to ensure that every sleep apnea patient is getting the supplies that they need in order to have the best possible therapy experience while saving the customer labor costs through software automation. This enhancement is the latest in a growing list of time saving features for our customers that maximize both the patient benefits as well as homecare provider benefits.", "Brightree also launched ConnectPRO at the Medtrade Industry Conference just earlier this week. ConnectPRO is a comprehensive solution that combines all technology services and data analytics that are necessary for our homecare customers to efficiently manage resupply workflows and to improve patients' resupply engagement.", "Our connected care strategy is also having a positive impact on the clinical front with ongoing publication of studies. The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine known more simply as The Blue Journal published a study run jointly by ResMed and Kaiser Permanente, which reported that remote monitoring improve the patient adherence to sleep apnea therapy.", "The key takeaway from the study was that telemonitoring of sleep apnea patients with ResMed's algorithms resulted in an increase of therapy adherence of 22% to 37%. This is statistically significant and also clinically significant data. We look forward to more publications using ResMed's database of the identified aggregated data. We are transforming big data of more than 1 billion nights of sleep metrics into actionable information that can improve clinical outcomes.", "Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 growth strategy. Our cloud connected non-invasive ventilators and light support ventilators continue to grow globally and we are building our connected care strategy for COPD. We relaunched our portable oxygen concentrator called Activox with improved quality and performance at our U.S., Canada and Latin America Sales Conference during the quarter.", "We expect steady growth of Activox throughout the year and beyond. Watch this space for future enhancements of our connected COPD offering. We are driving awareness of key clinical studies that have shown improvements in COPD mortality and reductions in COPD hospitalizations such as our home oxygen therapy, home mechanical ventilation study called HOT-HMV.", "Our market access teams are working to change the standard of care for COPD in key countries around the world to drive future growth in non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator usage and life support ventilation businesses to serve COPD patients.", "Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management models and out-of-hospital software businesses. This quarter Brightree announced the appointment of Robert Dean as General Manager of our home health and hospice business within Brightree. This continues to be a very exciting area for us with lots of long term growth potential.", "We are expanding out-of-hospital software offerings as we continue to grow and acquire software-as-a-service businesses for home health, home nursing and other alternative care settings. We\u2019ve had a tremendous start to the fiscal year and we are well positioned to grow revenue throughout fiscal year 2018 and beyond.", "We are encouraged by the success of our new product launches with the AirFit N20, the AirFit F20, the AirTouch F20 and the ResMed AirMini. We continue to work on a pipeline of new products and enhanced connected care solutions for sleep apnea, COPD and other critical chronic diseases.", "We have positioned the company for long-term top and bottom line growth for 2020 as we continue to execute our strategy and action, drive operating excellence and pioneer market leading connected care solutions. We have improved our 12 million lives over the last 12 months and we continue to pursue the holy grail of health care improving patients\u2019 quality of life, slowing chronic disease progression and reducing overall health care system costs.", "With that I will now turn the call over to Brett, our CFO, for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A. Over to you, Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the first quarter 2018. As Mick noted, we had a strong quarter. Group revenue for the September quarter was $523.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%.", "Taking a closer look at geographic distribution excluding revenue for Brightree, our sales in the Americas were $296.6 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. Sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific totaled $189 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, sales in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific increased by 11% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. Americas device sales were $157.9 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $138.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in combined EMEA and Asia Pacific, device sales were $128.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 9%.", "Masks and other sales were $60.7 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year quarter or, in constant currency terms, an increase of 15%. Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 8%, while masks and other increased by 14% over the prior year quarter.", "Brightree revenue for the first quarter was $38.1 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter. The Brightree results include two small acquisitions we made in our fourth quarter of FY 2017. On an organic basis, Brightree revenue for the quarter grew by 13%.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles. And in the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses. We have provided a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our first quarter earnings press release.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn to rest of the P&L. Our gross margin for the September quarter was 58.4%, lowering our prior year non-GAAP margin predominantly due to ASP declines. On a sequential basis, we saw an increase in gross margin reflecting favorable foreign currency movements and improved product mix from stronger masks sales.", "Assuming current exchange rates and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q1 FY 2018 gross margin. Moving on to operating expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $143.9 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. In constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 10%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.5% compared to the 27.7% that we reported last year.", "Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A growth rates to moderate over the course of fiscal year 2018. As a result, we continue to expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to progressively improve and to be approximately 26% of revenue by the end of the fiscal year.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $37.4 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or, on a constant currency basis, an increase of 6%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue was 7.1% compared to 7.4% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018.", "Moving further down the P&L. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.8 million for the quarter, consistent with the prior year quarter. Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $11.9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $124.3 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $94.1 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter.", "Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.66, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60. Additionally, foreign exchange movements positively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.01 per share, reflecting the favorable impacts from the stronger euro largely offset by the stronger Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.", "On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%. Looking forward, we estimate our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 22%. Cash flow from operations was $94 million for the quarter, reflecting strong underlying earnings and a modest increase in working capital balances. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the September quarter totaled $29.6 million.", "During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.7 million and repaid $60 million of our outstanding debt. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. And as previously announced we expect to recommence our share buyback in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.", "As a minimum, the aim of the buyback will be to offset the dilution impact from employee equity grants. This is estimated to be in the range of 1 million to 1.5 million shares annually. At September 30, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $208 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At September 30, total assets were $3.5 billion, and net equity was $2 billion.", "And with that, I will hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back into the queue. Mariama, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?", "Mick Farrell", "Got you loud and clear, Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Excellent, very nice quarter. I have two questions. The first one has to do with adoption of the ResMed AirMini. You are talking about adoption in certain geographies that are more comfortable paying out-of-pocket and I noticed the United States wasn't on the list. Can you discuss how \u2013 which regions are more willing to get into [indiscernible] with wonderful product and why not United States?", "Mick Farrell", "Sure, Joanne. I\u2019ll start and have a go then I might hand to Jim Hollingshead, the Present of our Sleep Business to talk about how we're expanding our AirMini business. Firstly, I'm a personal user of the ResMed AirMini and have been for many months. And I traveled all around the world with it and just in love with it as my new travel companion; literally anywhere I go around the planet it follows me. So that I get my great sleep apnea kit without having to get distilled water at Tokyo at 2\u2019o clock in the morning when I land from the direct flight from San Diego.", "The adoption of AirMini in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore and the U.K. where we have established cash pay channels has been very strong in fact far above our early expectations. Patients are really loving paying out-of-pocket for something that has provided such great care. But I\u2019d say in our business to business to consumer markets like the U.S. where we sell to our homecare providers and then they sell cash to patients.", "It's been a slower ramp up as those customers start to ramp up their cash businesses with all the changes of competitive bidding in the U.S. landscape change, our homecare providers in the U.S. are loving to build their cash businesses and it's something they've been working on strategically for a number of years. And we think the ResMed AirMini along with portable oxygen concentrators is a great opportunity for them and we\u2019re supporting them in both of that. But with that introduction to it, Jim anything further to add for the U.S. or beyond?", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yeah, thanks, Mick. I would just add that sales of the AirMini in the U.S. are actually going very well. I think that the comparison intended to Mick\u2019s comments is about on a sort of per patient basis you know where the relative volume of AirMini against the AirSense 10 platform. So the U.S. market, AirMini is performing as expected. We think it's launching well \u2013 really well. It will ramp. We\u2019re in a B2B2C model in the U.S. because we're selling it through our channel partners as Mick just spelled out and we see those volumes growing very nicely. It's in the markets where patients are having to pay cash for an AirSense 10 or they choose an AirMini where we're seeing on a proportional basis AirMini is being purchased more frequently.", "Joanne Wuensch", "And as my follow up question, you spoke about patient volumes for sleep apnea patients being somewhat strong, which is quite the opposite of what we're seeing in other pockets of med tech utilization. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in patient volumes and how you\u2019re measuring that? Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for your follow up, Joanne. We don\u2019t go into the details of patient volume growth within geographies. What I can say and the difference maybe between us and other parts of med tech is \u2013 this is a very personal experience of suffocation before therapy and then the experience of getting that gift the breath and the life change that can happen with sleep apnea. And taking the U.S. geography with somewhere between 40 million to 60 million Americans suffocating every night and maybe we have six or seven million so far diagnosed and on treatment.", "We still have 85, 80 plus \u2013 85% plus of the opportunity in front of us. So I think that a large pool of undiagnosed patients provides a regular flow into the sleep labs and into the homecare providers that allows for that sort of steady growth of patients into the channel. We've got a long way to go on that journey. And if you go to other geographies around the world, Western Europe, 85%, 90% of the opportunities still in front in terms of sufferers and getting them through the system.", "And in our Asia growth markets, the opportunity is above 95%, 98%, 99% in some of the geographies. So we think we\u2019re in mile one of a marathon here and we're really excited about that, patient volume growth continuing to grow steadily not just in this quarter, but throughout the fiscal year that we expect ahead and beyond.", "Operator", "Thank you. David Stanton from CLSA is online with a question.", "David Stanton", "Thanks very much and thank you for taking my question. I had a question about replenishment of mask. And I know that you\u2019ve rolled out a new replenishment systems through Brightree. Can you give us some kind of idea about what kind of replenishment growth rates particularly in the U.S. that would be greatly appreciated? Thank you. ", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, thanks, Dave. That's a good question. Clearly through ResMed Resupply which is part of the AirView software solutions package and part of Brightree Connect as we talked about linking on the backend with AirView. We are really working very closely with our homecare providers to make sure that every patient, who wants the mask and is qualified for a mask has the opportunity to get one. As I\u2019m saying earlier I am a personal user of this therapy and you need to change this mask. It's a piece of plastic that touches your face every day and stays on it hopefully for seven hours of sleep every night and even with regular washing and regular drawing the mask needs replacement.", "And we think there's a lot of opportunity. We know there's a lot of opportunity to work with patients and empower them with the information that they have to be able to access the supplies that they need. So without going specifically into numbers, we can tell you that qualitatively the pool of installed base of customers, patients who are using masks and want to resupply them is increasing quite strongly. And it's a large part of our mask and accessories category.", "David Stanton", "Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up would be, would it be fair to say that replenishment masks are growing as strong or less strong than new masks?", "Mick Farrell", "So, David, we probably don't want to go into the specifics of each category of masks, the installed base and new patient flow and how quickly they\u2019re growing. But if you think about it from sort of a mathematics point of view as the installed base grows larger and larger and we work on replenishment protocols with patients and expand them, there's some linear opportunities with new patient setup and some exponential opportunities with replenishment as you engage the patients throughout the world in all sorts of different models.", "David Stanton", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Steve Wheen from JPMorgan is online with a question. I apologize Steve Wheen is from Evans and Partners.", "Steve Wheen", "Yes, hello. Can you hear me?", "Mick Farrell", "Got you loud and clear, Steve. And I am glad we\u2019ve got your company right too.", "Steve Wheen", "No, no, that other one. Anyway I just had a question just on the revenue for mask. Obviously, a very nice step-up in mask growth and it follows the fourth quarter where there was a bit of hiatus just because of capacity. Is this an unusual growth rate that we\u2019re seeing in this quarter in terms of catch up and therefore it might moderate going forward? Or how do you see the appetite for these new masks, now that there is no restrictions oversupply.", "Mick Farrell", "Yeah, Steve, as we have talked about 90 days ago, we did 90 days ago still have some supply constraints that we were just leaving at the end of Q4 throughout Q1 we were supply unconstrained. And we were able to meet and beat the very fast demand as you saw for masks throughout the world. And if you look at the masks and accessories category, it grew at 13% on a constant currency basis in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and it grew at 15% on a constant currency basis in Europe and Asian countries.", "Look, we think that that we can continue to grow masks all the way throughout the fiscal year. There were all sorts of different changes that happen in terms of comparables from quarter X and quarter Y as you go through out of fiscal year. But as you think about the next twelve months and twenty four months, we think the runway of the F20, the AirFit F20, the AirFit N20, so the full phase and the nasal components are very strong.", "And we're just out of the gate with the AirTouch F20, which is our brand new technology which incorporates both the LSR, or liquid silicon rubber, but also foam technology. And it's early days, but patients are really loving that opportunity. And so we're working with our channel partners on the business side of it. But in terms of patient acceptance, we\u2019re seeing some really good patient acceptance.", "So having said all that, I think we've got a really good runway ahead for growth throughout fiscal 2018 for our masks. I don't think it's a catch up. I think it's the start of a steady growth pattern that we should see throughout fiscal 2018, 2019 and beyond.", "Steve Wheen", "Great. And then just on life follow up question. On the SG&A side, I wonder if Brett you might be able to give us some color as to the major drivers of that tailing off as a percentage of revenue by the end of the year. What's driving that? Is it legal costs related? Yes, if you could just give us some color as to what the major \u2013 what\u2019s underpinning that?", "Brett Sandercock", "Okay, sure, Steve. You will have a head spin if you look at the last several quarters. We have \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve been \u2013 if you like, we are being elevated in terms of things such as litigation costs. But also we launched a lot of new products in terms of marketing promotion and so on, that\u2019s probably running a little more elevated as well. And we probably \u2013 you still see some of that manifest in Q1, but as we work through the quarters, and then obviously we\u2019ll work with a team on this as well. We expect those growth rates to moderate \u2013 sort of more normalized I guess in what we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 months and bringing us confidence that we can trend that down.", "Steve Wheen", "So there would be specifically a reduction in legal costs within that number.", "Brett Sandercock", "I not let that, I mean, you can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s a difficult one to predict. I wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019d say you kind of \u2013 it builds more, let\u2019s say builds more into the run rate so to speak.", "Steve Wheen", "Yeah, sure. Thank you.", "Operator", "David Low from JPMorgan is online with a question.", "David Low", "Thanks very much. Could I just start with Brett your comment with when you talk on gross margins about some ASP pressure, let\u2019s see if you could talk a little bit anything in particular that showing up in this quarter that [indiscernible] different from what we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "Brett Sandercock", "I mean not particularly, David, we \u2013 you see every year in and year out. You see ASP the content impacting your gross margin. So I guess it\u2019s just to call out of the main impact on gross margin year-on-year. If I look at it sequentially, it looked actually pretty good and we\u2019re quite pleased with that uptick there on the margin. So, no, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s adjusting unusually met and it\u2019s kind of more typical with what we experienced in terms of SSP declines.", "David Low", "Okay, great, thanks. And if I could just touch on the oxygen concentrator, the Activox, could you talk a little bit about where you think that product is positioned versus the competition? It\u2019s been a fast growing space. You see something that now becomes a material contributor quite quickly or is that something that\u2019s slightly to grow gradually over time?", "Mick Farrell", "Look, yeah, David, as I said in the prepared remarks, we just relaunched with the quality and new capability in systems around our Activox system as we\u2019ve now incorporated that acquisition of Inova into our business and relaunched it really with our sales team this quarter. I will hand to Rob Douglas, our COO, to maybe provide some further detail on our POC business.", "Rob Douglas", "Sure, David. We described some of the quality improvements that\u2019s really under the hood quality improvement. So, we\u2019re very happy with those quality improvements and how they\u2019re going and our customers let\u2019s say use the product will start to experience those improvements. The product positioned us very portable. It's got the longest battery life. It\u2019s very light weight. It\u2019s a good performer. And we see steady take up of it. And we\u2019re patient with this product and we're going to make sure it has really the ResMed quality, and provides really good treatment to patients and we\u2019ll build on that.", "David Low", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Good morning Brett. Good afternoon everyone else. First question for me is on the generator growth this quarter, which remained quite strong in the Americas. So maybe you guys can give us a little bit more detail around what's driving the strength. You've been keeping in this high single-digit range. Is it existing accounts increasing their mix of the resonate platform, given all of the new software offerings, just underlying patient volume? Any additional color would be great. Thanks.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks for the question Margaret. And yes, we did see strong growth in Q1. If you take the U.S., Canada Latin America countries combined we saw 8% constant currency growth in Q1, and across the Europe and Asia countries, we saw 9% constant currency growth. Look, we think the total market is growing in that mid-to-high single digits across the sleep market with devices sort of more towards the mid-single digits and masks toward the high-single digits. Implying in Q1 that we did take share within the device and mask categories, and we believe that to be true. Of course, we don't go into detail around that. But some of the reasons behind that are certainly all boats are floating on the strong patient growth that we talked about earlier, but we are taking share.", "And I think the share is as you've seen now, it's 36 months since we launched AirSense 10 and Air Solutions platform. And it's really a solution when you combine it together. We've published data now in the peer-reviewed press that shows that we can reduce labor costs for our home care provider customers by up to 59%. So when you have a system that can lower labor cost for your customers by 59%, it can really help them to start to say not only will I try this device and try this software, but I'll double down on it, and I\u2019ll continue to invest in it. And we're seeing a lot of customers garner a lot of profit growth for themselves that they didn't take that cash and reinvest in the business for better patient care.", "So we think this is really a win for ResMed. Obviously, as you see in these numbers. It's a win for our home care customers that use ResMed, and it's a win for the patients because they get better care. They engage daily sometimes with their myAir app and check out their myAir score and their adherence rates move from 50%, 60% historically in this industry up to 87% in one of our published studies and beyond that in some of our unpublished work.", "So we think it is sustainable, strong value proposition with our customers that's driving it, Margaret.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Great. And then on the breakthrough side as a follow-up. That one is chugging along as well, you\u2019ve got this low to mid-teens, and I know some of that is the acquisitions, but how should we think about acquisitions being off for the rest of the Brightree installed base? Can those be material to your growth? And then just as you think about that underlying growth, is it new accounts? Or again those existing accounts just choosing and selecting more new offerings that you have? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. So another good question, Margaret. Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Brightree growth was 13% constant currency if you didn't include any of the tuck-in acquisitions, and it's 15% constant currency, including the modest tuck-in acquisitions that we did throughout the year AllCall and so on into Brightree.", "Look, yes, solid, low to mid-teen growth in our software-as-a-service business. We think that some of that is new accounts. Our sales team at Brightree is excellent. [Audio Gap] and I and a bunch of the team, Raj went out there to Atlanta to spend time with the team and in a leadership program and looking at those top not just sales but development leaders and how they're teaming up and really adapting the ResMed culture but keeping a strong Brightree software-as-a-service culture and driving a really strong commercial performance.", "And so we think that's sustainable, taking into account share but also growing users within existing accounts. We find that the HME providers who partnered with Brightree grow, and as they grow, they get more users. And software-as-a-service system users is paid on a per basis. So you can grow by getting new accounts. You can also grow by helping new customers grow.", "So we're doing both.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Great thanks.", "Operator", "Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question. ", "Sean Laaman", "Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just back on Activox, Mick. I'm just wondering if you can give us a bit more granularity on sort of specifically the relaunch and what you might have changed from what you're doing before to what you're doing with the relaunch, that would be really good.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes I\u2019ll hand it over to Rob.", "Rob Douglas", "Yes, Sean. As I said before, we \u2013 ResMed's position in the markets are very high-tech, high-quality value and innovation. As we got our early experience with the Activox, we saw a number of improvements that we wanted to make, and we made those improvements. I described them earlier as improvements under the hood. So they're really \u2013 they're not features, but they're improving the delivery of the existing features. And as I say we progressively incremented them in a sequential basis, and then we really looking to the absolute measure, which is our customers' response to those to see how we go \u2013 to see to really put the metrics around the quality improvements and what extra value that adds.", "And I can't really get granular on the exact next steps of improvements that we're coming up simply because we don't forecast our R&D programs for competitive reasons, but I would say we've got a very strong team working on it. We've got some great ideas. We still got the feature that we have talked about, about adding some of our connected care capability into the system, which we believe will further improve the quality of delivery of oxygen treatment of patients but also improve the ability of our HME customers to manage those patients and those fleets of devices that they need to. And that's all work in progress.", "Sean Laaman", "Thanks Rob, thanks Mick. And may be just a quick follow-up for Bret. Are you able to give us a sense of what currency you might be thinking going forward for the euro and the Aussie?", "Brett Sandercock", "[Indiscernible] this morning they changed for me already, but when I was looking at that we're sort of \u2013 we were being forecasting around that sort of $0.78 to $0.79 of the U.S. and around $1.18 on the euro, euro U.S. they're moving around quite a bit of volatility. So yes, on that one, Sean, but that's sort of what we're using as being current rates at the time we looked at it a few days ago.", "Sean Laaman", "Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you everybody.", "Operator", "Saul Hadassin from Credit Suisse is online with a question.", "Saul Hadassin", "Thanks. Good morning guys. Brett, can I start with a quick question on gross margin just to clarify or confirm your comments regarding the outlook for gross margin of the remainder of fiscal 2018. Did you say it should be consistent with 1Q 2018 as a result? ", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I said broadly consistent.", "Saul Hadassin", "And I just wonder if you can give us some of the contributing points to that considering the mix seems to be improving on the mask side and just cognitive of what currency is doing. But is there anything else presumably, you've got some efficiencies coming through manufacturing so what's maybe offsetting the incremental improvement in gross margin over the fiscal year?", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure. We saw \u2013 well, and I'll just we did see some incremental improvement from Q4 and Q1. And we did see certainly you can see some improvement in product mix, and that's been a turnaround for us. And the expectation is that will be more a tailwind for us as opposed to a headwind over the last few years that\u2019s positive on that. And there's number of factors playing out on ASP decline, FX, manufacturing procurement efficiencies, and so on, which we do expect to get over the course of the year. But the product mix and how we're looking, I guess, the portfolio a little more diversified now as well.", "So that plays into looking at predict on gross margin as well. So I think all in the mix. I guess the other thing I would say is that stronger Aussie on a sequential basis kind of hurt us going into Q2 and essentially a factor that in as well. So that would be headwind for us going sequentially selects inclusive of that. So some of the other underlying trends I think are there in a positive but there could be few going against us, particularly on the FX next quarter. But broadly consistent, I guess, what we're saying is we're comfortable with that margin around where it's at, and we're seeing good growth across both devices and mask, which I think is really showing the strength of the business and a good diversified portfolio.", "So I think it's going to \u2013 with that sales growth and good gross profit dollars, and I think that's in good shape for us going forward.", "Saul Hadassin", "Thanks Brett. That\u2019s all I had.", "Operator", "Andrew Goodsall from UBS is online with a question.", "Andrew Goodsall", "Thanks for taking my questions. Just in the U.S. instant card consolidation with DMEs over the last few years. Just try and give us a sense of what you seem pressure on prices, I guess, the business under the hands of larger buyers.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question Andrew. Clearly, over the last three, to five years, there has been some consolidation in our U.S. home care provider base, still around 5000-plus home medical equipment providers in the U.S. So quite a large and diverse group of local mom-and-pop, regionals as well as national players, and we partner with people across that spectrum. As I look at the market, I think we see a relative sampling of changes in reimbursement, some of those big step changes that happen in the early phases of the U.S. government CMS program to get in line with our private payers and now we have a sort of steady program going forward.", "And I think a pretty broad view at CMS that actually investing in sleep apnea care reduces long-term costs for the government, and we're certainly as I said on the AdvaMed Board of Directors, we definitely spend time in Washington letting Washington know that medical devices as an industry is able to lower long-term costs by keeping patients, particularly in sleep apnea and in COPD, out of hospital and under better care.", "So we're seeing a pretty steady reimbursement environment. It does have reductions, but they're reasonably steady. So I think we're able to weather that and work with our home care providers to make sure that they use Brightree and they use AirView, and they can lower their labor cost by 50%, 60%, and that's the way to free up cash to reinvest in marketing to primary care doctors and going after the 40 million, 50 million, 60 million people who are suffocating. And as yet haven't had a chance to get diagnosed, get treated and get a better quality of life.", "Andrew Goodsall", "And Rob may be just to you as my follow-up question. I guess just in terms of your proposition, which is, I guess, potentially higher price mask relative to some of the competition, but I guess a bit of a longer-term recurring revenue line. I\u2019m just trying to understand how that's going with the better sales propositions going with the DMEs in terms of them taking through the benefits of that program versus perhaps just going for margin or sorry, low pricing to increase margin initially.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes thanks Andrew. I\u2019ll handle that follow-up to Jim Hollingshead, our President of Global Sleep business.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Andrew I think on your first question we still see consolidation in the market, but it's nothing of out trend right. I mean, there's been no unusual change in consolidation in the U.S. market as Mick said remains very fragments where you get right down to it, right? 5,500 roughly providers of sleep. What we're seeing is that HME customers more and more are realizing how important it is to them and their business to resupply patients. And so we have seen the scheme up a little bit earlier the call. We have an on ongoing increase in adoption of resupply platforms. And our offerings, especially through Brightree, have made that a lot easier for our customers. And so as they adopt those more automated approaches to resupply, they're able to grow that side of their business.", "Andrew Goodsall", "That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor from Barclays is on line with a question.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi thanks for taking the question. Can you hear that?", "Brett Sandercock", "Got you loud and clear Matt.", "Matt Taylor", "Great. So Brett, I did have one follow-up on the gross margin. You had talked in the past about mix being the biggest factor. So I was still a little bit surprised that we didn't see more of a lift this quarter. Can you just talk about the rest of the year, what you're expecting from effect on gross margin? And is it mainly the Aussie dollar that's holding it back from being better with this better mix?", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure, Matt. I mean, I guess, you should have asked that back a little while, I guess you've got to put a little bit of context a few years ago when we're seeing what you are experiencing like huge growth rates in devices. So we're talking 30%, 40%, almost 50%. So the differential between the device growth and mask growth was very substantial back then. So that did have a bit of impact on product mix. So we're still seeing that impact, but obviously, can be more modest when differential is perhaps more like 5%.", "So I mean, part of it is, if you like, the resilience and the strength of the device that we're seeing, which is a very good thing. So therefore, the thing. So therefore, the product mix, I guess, is more modest than what you might have seen two years ago, which makes sense. And the other thing I'd add to that is if you looked at you go back to FY\u201914, masks were probably something like, matching other categories something like 46% of our revenue. You fast-forward to today is about 38%.", "So there has kind of been that kind of overall change in our mix as well. So that plays into it as well. But \u2013 so it's still there the trends there the improved product mix is there, but it's on a more modest scale than what you might have seen when devices were growing really strongly back in FY\u201915.", "Matt Taylor", "Thanks. And your continued device growth a couple of years after the AirSense launch has been impressive. And I guess, I was wondering if you thought you continue to grow at kind of above-market rates with just the base AirSense. And if you could comment on how material you think of oxygen concentrators and the Mini can be.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes that\u2019s a great question Matt. I\u2019ll turn try with that. Look, if you think about it, the portfolio of devices we have is a lot broader now. Brett's talking about the change of connected care and our sort of leadership in connected care, not only within our vertical, sleep apnea, COPD, but across the med tech sector has launched us to the No. 1 position in devices in flow generators, and that's a large ballast in the boat to Brett's point much higher percentage of our portfolio. So GM percentage lines move less strongly although gross profit dollars and net operating profit as you saw this quarter growing at 12% year-on-year in OP is really solid growth and that's free cash flow. And we invest free cash flow cash back into our business. We don't invest percentages back into our business, and so we manage on the growth of that.", "But our continued device growth will expand, and I think you can add on sort of strong, steady maintenance and growth of share. But more importantly growth of patients into the funnel to keep device growth strong and steady. And as you said, there's upside as you add on to ResMed AirMini, which is brand-new category. It's cash pay. It's a second use, it's travel path, and it's sold direct in some markets. It's sold through our great home care provider customers in the U.S. and many European countries, and we think that's good addition. As you said, there's portable oxygen concentrators, and there's also our growing COPD play in noninvasive ventilation and life-support ventilation, and we have now cloud connected both of those, the NIV.", "So our AirCurve 10 range and our Astral devices both now have cloud connectivity. We're in the early days of driving our connected COPD strategy, but that's a very high-cost disease state. It\u2019s The number three killer in the world, COPD. And it's the number two cause for rehospitalization. So we think as we look forward to 2020 and beyond, there's a lot of opportunity to have steady and growing device growth as we look forward to the longer term", "Matt Taylor", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Victor Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes hi, it\u2019s [indiscernible]. I just wanted to ask a bit more about the COPD and also as it relates to the device growth overall. So just as we look forward, do you think RSA itself can continue to grow mid-single digits? And then the COPD part of them, if you like, is on top of device growth given we're relatively early in the journey there? Or how does that sort of play out long term? And then all also perhaps you could talk to where do you think we are in terms of capturing the value out of the noninvasive vent side, you talked about Europe side.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes. Thanks, Victor [ph]. The answer is yes. I mean, I think the sleep apnea market as we said earlier is growing in mid-to-high single digits with the devices more in that mid-single-digit range. I think we can continue to hold and grow share in the device side that will allow us to grow the sleep apnea business and that mid-single digits in the device category. And in addition to the ResMed AirMini, which is on top of that as a cash pay and the POCs, which is on top of that, there are the noninvasive ventilator devices. Where we're at on that is the early stages.", "There are 400 million, 500 million patients worldwide who suffer from chronic obstructive preliminary disease or lung disease. Many of them remain undiagnosed or undertreated. Many of them need to get first initial drug therapy, and they need oxygen therapy and then they need non-invasive ventilation therapy. And then as their disease progresses towards more chronic care, they need life-support ventilation therapy. And so ResMed plans to be walking with those COPD patients along that channel.", "So this is a longer-term development. It's sort of part of our 2020 and even our 2020 strategies. We're starting to put that together and developing our connected COPD strategy, and we'll be doing that with partners across med tech and pharma and beyond. And so watch this space for longer-term growth there, but we're really excited about the growth in our core business of sleep apnea and our second Horizon of growth in COPD and our third Horizon of growth in out-of-hospital software. And if you put them all together, I think you've got a very strong and dynamic portfolio.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the cash pay at kind of CPAP side that it seems that\u2019s going better in the market ofAustralia in stage? Is that cannibalizing mainly in cash pay market with us cannibalizing sales? Or how much is there [indiscernible]?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes I\u2019ll hand that to Rob.", "Rob Douglas", "So our view of the market whole new segment, and so it's contributing to growth. And when a person buys an AirMini to travel in addition to their home sleep app, that's really good for them and to sell that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had. So we see a very strongly contributing to growth. As Jim said earlier in some of the cash pay markets, there are some people will say actually I will not use that, it\u2019s my premium one. We\u2019re okay with that either way. But really on as a whole in most of the markets AirMini is really a strong contributor.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Anthony Petrone from Jefferies is online with a question.", "Anthony Petrone", "Good afternoon good morning thank you for taking the question. Maybe make a little bit on rising tide carrying all boats here Philips put up a pretty good print as well high single digit growth. So many a little bit more on is it a reimbursement thing that that benefiting everyone in the marketplace? Is it another dynamic that whether it's in a DME channel or again you also mentioned reimbursement coverage in France. Just trying to get maybe why this quarter's a little bit different from an underlying funnel/volume perspective.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Anthony. Yes, look, I think there is some rising tide there, and that's a global mid-single digits to high-single digits market growth. And so other players are going in that mid- to high single digit range as well. As I said earlier, I do think we're taking share with connected care. You mentioned France. There is four levels of reimbursement for sleep apnea therapy that starts from January 1 in France. And the highest is telemonitored patients with adherence over 4 hours and telemonitored patients with two to four hours and then below that non-telemonitored patients, and so on. And ResMed's been leading in connected care not just in the U.S. but globally, and we've been preparing for this type of a change, and we're really excited that the government of France has recognized that they get a return on investment by telemonitoring patients, increasing adherence and taking those patients out of hospital.", "So we think this market is great and growing and good for all players, but we think it's particularly good for people who are looking at ways to take cost out of that channel and partner with their customers, which include the home care providers but also the patients like giving them their own data every day patients use their devices more. I mean, adherence rates of 87% is unheard of in our industry, and we're publishing that and getting it in the peer-reviewed press in the Blue Journal, Jama, Lancet and you're going to see more from us on that. We have one billion nights of sleep data in the identified aggregated data, and we're going to be putting clinical studies out there to show this therapy, sleep apnea therapy is very beneficial, and we'll be doing the same in COPD as we move forward.", "Anthony Petrone", "Great and then just a follow-up would be just a bit on working capital once again, just on year-over-year basis. AARs ticked up quite a bit as inventory. I'm just wondering is there reason to hold more inventory? Is there an elongated sales cycle in the same on the credit sales? And is there an elongated cycle there as well? Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "So I\u2019ll handle the question to Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Thanks Mick. Thanks Anthony Petrone. On the data side, [indiscernible] I think is still within kind of our range that we would expect and fairly typically historically, and it's probably still may be allow us maybe 12 months ago but still comfortable with where we are on that. On the inventory front, you're right. We're up a little on the inventory, but it's been pretty well documented. We're a little bit supply constrained on masks and so on. So some of that is kind of a rebuild into getting that right. So you see that's kind of manifested in the inventory a little bit as well. That's all the way through the supply chain.", "So we're now in much better shape, but I guess that's reflected in some inventory build. And then going forward, I'd expect not necessarily come down, but I'd expect sort of the growth with moderate as we kind of balance a bit better now.", "Anthony Petrone", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks, Mariama. In closing, I want to thank the more than 6,000-strong ResMed team for their execution on our new product launches. This quarter, that hard work has translated into market share gains, revenue growth and double-digit 12% net operating profit growth. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit all of our customers, including patients, physicians, payers and providers. We will talk to you again in 90 days. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

The U.S., Canada, and Latin America teams achieved solid revenue growth of 12% on a constant currency basis.

Over to you, Brett.", "Brett Sandercock", "Great, thanks, Mick. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.", "As Mick noted, we had a very strong quarter. Group revenue for the December quarter was $601.3 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, revenue increased by 11%.", "Taking a closer look at our geographic distribution and excluding revenue from our Brightree software-as-a-service business, our sales in the U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries were $329.2 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets totaled $233.4 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, sales in Europe, Asia, and other markets increased by 8% over the prior year quarter.", "Breaking out revenue between product segments. U.S., Canada, and Latin Americas device sales were $173.7 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. Masks and other sales were $155.5 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year quarter. The revenue in Europe, Asia, and other markets device sales were $163.3 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, an increase of 5%. Masks and other sales were $70.1 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, a 16% increase.", "Globally, in constant currency terms, device sales increased by 9%, while masks and other increased by 13% over the prior year quarter.", "Brightree revenue for the second quarter was $38.7 million, an increase of 14% on the prior year quarter.", "During the rest of my commentary today, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers. The non-GAAP measures adjust for the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles and tax-related charges associated with the recently enacted U.S. Tax reforms. In the prior year comparable, they exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses associated with additional contingent consideration, restructuring expenses, and litigation settlement expenses. We will provide a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP numbers in our second quarter earnings press release.", "Our gross margin for the December quarter was 58.2% compared with 58.3% during the same quarter in the prior year. Our margin was essentially consistent with the prior year and reflects typical declines in average selling prices, largely offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies. Consistent with our comments last quarter, on a sequential basis our gross margin in Q2 was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency movements. Assuming current exchange rates, and likely trends in product and geographic mix, we expect gross margin for the balance of fiscal year 2018 to be broadly consistent with our Q2 FY18 gross margin.", "Moving onto operating expenses, our SG&A expenses for the quarter were $151.8 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year quarter or in constant currency terms, SG&A expenses increased by 6%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 25.2% compared to the 26.3% that we reported last year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 25% to 26% for the balance of fiscal year 2018.", "R&D expenses for the quarter were $40.6 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year quarter or in a constant currency basis an increase of 4%. This increase reflects incremental investments across our R&D portfolio. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were 6.8% compared to 7.2% in the prior year. Looking forward, and subject to currency movements, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue to be in the vicinity of 7% for the balance of fiscal year 2018.", "Amortization of acquired intangibles was $11.3 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3% over the prior year quarter.", "Stock-based compensation expense for the quarter was $12 million.", "Non-GAAP operating profit for the quarter was $157.3 million, an increase of 20% over the prior year quarter, while non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $143.8 million, an increase of 39% over the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1, an increase of 37% over the prior quarter, while GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.07. The growth in non-GAAP earnings per share was partly due to a lower tax rate this quarter. Achieving a normalized tax rated 22%, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.83, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter.", "Now I'd like to spend some time discussing tax-related matters. On a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the December quarter was 93.3% reflecting one-time charges associated with a recent change in U.S. tax laws. U.S. accounting rules require us to recognize the effect of any tax law changes during the period in which they are enacted. Accordingly we have recorded an additional income tax expense of $126.6 million in our December quarter.", "Specifically this amount includes two items. First, the transition tax imposed on our accumulated foreign earnings resulting in additional income tax expense of $119.9 million; and second, the write-down of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets means a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, which resulted in additional income tax expense of $6.7 million.", "On a non-GAAP basis which excludes the one-time charges I've just discussed, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 6%.", "Adjusting for the impact from ASU 2016-09 which governs accounting for the tax deductions for employee stock-based payments, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11%.", "Our non-GAAP effective tax was lower this quarter because our tax rate in previous quarters have forecasted the repatriation of cash to the U.S. this fiscal year. The taxes attributable to repatriation will no longer be due in the U.S. because of the recent U.S. tax reforms. For the same reason, we now estimate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of 15% to 16%.", "Now I'll turn to guidance on our expected fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate. There are two important factors to consider. First, Australian draft legislation designed to implement certain base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS, initiatives related to hybrid mismatches likely to be enacted in calendar year 2018 and be effective for our 2019 fiscal year. This will impact the taxation of our transactions between Australia and the rest of our global businesses and likely result in additional accessible income attributable to the Australian tax jurisdiction resulting in a higher effective tax rate.", "Secondly, the recent U.S. tax changes will reduce our effective tax rate predominately associated with a new territorial tax system which will allow for little or no tax on future earnings repatriated to the U.S. from our foreign subsidiaries. Taking into account, the impacts from both the Australian perspective legislative changes, and the U.S. tax legislative changes, and their estimates of the geographic attribution of our income, we estimate our fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate will be in the range of 21% to 23%.", "To round out the implications of the U.S. tax reform it's important to note that the U.S. legislative changes will be positive for ResMed from a financial and treasury management perspective. We will now have far more flexibility to repatriate cash back to the U.S. at little or no tax cost. We will be able to more effectively utilize our strong global cash flows to invest in growth opportunities and undertake capital management activities.", "Moving on from tax-related matters, during the second quarter cash flow from operations was $132.6 million reflecting strong underlying earnings.", "Capital expenditure for the quarter was $16 million. Depreciation and amortization for the December quarter totaled $29.4 million.", "During the quarter we paid dividends of $49.9 million. Our Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share. Additionally, as we discussed during last quarter's call, we recommenced our share buyback during the second quarter and repurchased 100,000 shares consideration of $8.5 million.", "At December 31, we have $1 billion in gross debt and $160 million in net debt. Our balance sheet remains strong with modest debt levels. At December 31, total assets were $3.6 billion and net equity was $2 billion.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, Brett. We will now turn to Q&A and we ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question only. If you have additional questions after that please get back into the queue. Christine, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "Margaret Kaczor from William Blair is on the line with a question.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Everyone thanks for taking the question. First of all you guys had a really nice quarter in terms of showing operating leverage and SG&A leverage, even taking all the moving pieces out. But maybe walk us through what's been driving the recent results in SG&A leverage maybe what the long-term level for that SG&A or operating margin could be and really what it gets down to should we assume multiple years of leverage here?", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks for the question, Margaret. And as we talked about on previous calls, if you look back over five-plus-years ResMed had around 30%, 32% of our revenue in SG&A and in most recent quarters we've taken that down to 27% as a percentage of revenue because we're able to grow and leverage our world leading scale within the sleep apnea and respiratory care and now out-of-hospital software markets. We expect that to continue. And as Brett said in his prepared remarks we want to leave this fiscal year with a run rate of around 26% of our revenues at SG&A and even beyond that as we look to FY19.", "And so I think there's a lot of runway left for leverage around SG&A. We're a global leader, the global leader in sleep apnea and respiratory care, and we have a right to win in out-of-hospital software and I think we can leverage that scale to grow efficiently. So I'd summarize that there's a lot of runway ahead over multiple fiscal years here, Margaret.", "Margaret Kaczor", "Good. And then just as a follow-up on international seems likes it continues to remain focus for you guys in relation in telemonitoring. I know you had some weird comps with China from the year ago period, but what inning are you guys today in driving telemonitoring internationally and are there any advanced talks on a national, regional level outside of France to drive ongoing fleet upgrades. Thanks.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, that's a great question, Margaret; it allows us to talk about digital health and connected health beyond just the United States. We've had excellent progress the last three-and-a-half years in the U.S. millions literally north of $4 million, 100% cloud connected medical devices. 6 million patients in the AirView system, and that keeps growing every day.", "But as we highlighted in the prepared remarks it's fantastic to see a country like France where the government who paid most of the healthcare bill through Social Security healthcare looking at the sleep apnea space and saying there is an ROI here to invest in telemonitored sleep devices. If we have patients that have telemonitored devices they use them more and as the data showed that we published and the French government knows that if the patient uses their device more they stay out of hospital more. They have a better quality of life and in fact their survival rights go up.", "So the French government making that change, January 1, is fantastic, we think there's a lot of runway ahead across France and as we look across Western Europe and across Europe, Asia, and all the other markets that we do business in, we are in regular conversations through our market access team with the governments and major players in the United States and other for-profit payers and we will get the message through that having telemonitoring, having connected health and digital health, improves outcomes, lowest costs, and save lives. And we do think that other countries will follow suit after France and it's great to have them out there.", "Operator", "Sean Laaman from Morgan Stanley is online with a question.", "Sean Laaman", "Good morning and thanks for taking my call. My first question is to Brett. Brett, could you give us a guide on the FX impact on GM in the quarter.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes. As we mentioned Sean, it was pretty meaningful this quarter. If you looked at sequentially it was kind of in the order of 50 basis points negative. So it was quite a big impact on the gross margins. So, yes, if we know that we're kind of pretty pleased with where we end up with the gross margins because we have quite a big headwind on FX.", "Sean Laaman", "Okay, great, thanks Brett. And Mick, are you able to give us a bit of a guide on what features the Mobi has versus Activox?", "Mick Farrell", "Sean thanks for the question. Unfortunately for the call but fortunately for our sales team and our commercial teams has been long time designing again this product ready. We're not ready yet to publicly announce the specific features and capabilities.", "What I said at the conference earlier this month, and I'm happy to repeat here, is that this has got really good oxygen output; it's got excellent battery life and a really good blend of all the other parameters that are needed to make out-of-home portable oxygen concentrators, the best they can be. And by putting the ResMed brand on it running it and release it when we believe the quality is at the level that deserves that brand and that's what we're working towards.", "Operator", "David Low from J.P. Morgan is online with a question.", "David Low", "Thanks very much for taking my questions. Perhaps we could just touch on France again, Mick just you talked about the change happening from the 1st of January, just wondering what you're seeing there, I mean presumably from the results we're seeing, you saw good buying ahead of the change and sort of where do you think we are up to in terms of sleep replacement to take advantage of the new reimbursement structure?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, David, as you indicated the reimbursement change went into effect January 1, but our French colleagues and customers and partners in the ecosystem in France have known about this for a number of months or quarters. And so there has been some, if you like, upgrading of the fleet from non-cloud connected to cloud connected devices over the last three, six months. We see more runway ahead of that for France.", "And really importantly, we see patients getting better care, using their devices more therefore using more masks, but most importantly, staying at a hospital and being well taken care of. And we think there is a positive domino effect here where other countries will see this change based upon real data including the data that we published in the Peer Reviewed press this quarter and say this is the right direction to go. So we are in active discussions well beyond just one or two countries here or 120 countries we sell our products into, we are looking to get the message out there that telemonitoring and cloud connectivity and digital health and connected care can save costs and improved lives. But more runway left in France and a lot more across the other 119 countries we sell into over the coming fiscal years.", "David Low", "Great, thanks very much. And just one other, I mean you had very strong sales growth which is really impressive. But perhaps if you could talk to market conditions, I mean, I think let's perhaps start in the U.S. trying to get a sense as to how much is this ResMed gaining share and how much is this market conditions picking up in terms of patient setups mask replacement?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, that's a good question. I will hand that to Jim Hollingshead who runs our Global Sleep Business.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yes, thanks David. I think patient growth continues to be strong. Globally, as you know, sleep apnea is underdiagnosed and we are continuing to see increasing awareness in the markets and increasing patient setup. There is a little bit of cyclicality in the mask business especially in the U.S. because of the way deductibles, end of the calendar year and so we always get a little bit of pick up in masks, with some cyclicality, but the underlying growth in the market I think is driven by patient awareness, and obviously the economy has been a little bit stronger, so overall positive in both directions.", "Operator", "Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets is online with a question.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good afternoon, very nice quarter. Can you spend a moment talking about your Mobi portable oxygen concentrator? How is that going to be sold into the home? Will you combine that with your current home CPAP sales force? Are you going to build out something separate?", "Mick Farrell", "That's a great question, Joanne. I'm going to hand that to Rob Douglas, our Chief Operating Officer.", "Rob Douglas", "Yes, thanks, Mick. Joanne, we are currently selling the Activox throughout our existing sales force and doing that very successfully and the license ship and the discussion for customers around the world are very relevant and portal oxygen we think represents a really good business opportunity for many of our customers around the world.", "Mobi, as ResMed brand, will just be an extension of that and a stronger player and that will be part of our existing sales teams. Mobi and we are really looking forward to it coming out, we're really excited about it, it's going to have fairly strong performance.", "Joanne Wuensch", "As a follow-up, were there anything -- was there anything specific in the quarter extra selling days, stocking, anything particularly of note that we should be able to factor in to as we think about this quarter but also project on to next year?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, thanks Joanne. No nothing out of the ordinary in this Q2 in terms of the channel. I think what we're seeing is we've had three-and-a-half years of the Air Solutions and AirSense portfolio that's incredibly value for customers. They continue to buy those sleep devices and those respiratory care devices that fit on the AirView platform. And we're seeing really good traction of N20 nasal mask and the F20 full face mask. These are the smallest, quietest, and most comfortable in their category. The plastic that fits on the bridge of the nose on an F20 and N20 is the thinnest and most comfortable plastic that you can have of any mask on the market. So I think that's what's leading to the share gains that we got this quarter and I think there is some sustainability to those share gains as we look forward.", "Joanne Wuensch", "All right. Very helpful. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Thanks Joanne.", "Operator", "Steve Wheen from Evans & Partners is online with a question.", "Steve Wheen", "Yes, good morning. Just a question around gross margin for Brett. You've obviously got in this quarter a particularly large headwind from currency and therefore the offset through manufacturing efficiencies was obviously pretty compelling. What's the runway like on those manufacturing efficiencies for the back half of the year because I expected actually must improve, mainly because the currency now has probably gotten even bigger headwind to come given the strength of the Aussie dollar recently? Can you just sort of talk through how that might look and what are the moving parts going into the back half of the year?", "Brett Sandercock", "Sure, Steve. I mean we have a program around kind of initiatives in both manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and so on to really work on a number of initiatives and we're kind of keep track of that pipeline pretty full, then it's a matter of executing on those and in the time when they drop. So let's not get overly granular but we\u2019re working on that all time and we expect to kind of drop if you like initiatives that will take cost out over a period of time and there will be some of those will manifest in the second half. But it's only progressive and it's a long-term program and you just got to continue to execute on the initiatives you identify and keep that pipeline full and that's certainly what the team done.", "So I guess it's more progressive, Steve, rather than sort of sudden big jolt to it. So we just got to keep executing on those initiatives and that will continue to drive cost out of the all that COGS area.", "Steve Wheen", "And so even with the Aussie Dollar at $0.80, you still got the ability to maintain that gross margin at current levels with the procurement side and manufacturing efficiencies?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I mean guiding to be broadly consistent right. We will have some headwind with Aussie at $0.80. I mean clearly if that keeps tracking up that's a different ball game but at the moment, I mean, it's a quarter away, so into Q3 it won't be so bad, if you look into Q4 then clearly there is a bit of a headwind there but we've kind of managed currencies on the Aussie all the way from mine [ph] time $0.47 to $1.03. So I think we just got to -- we just have to live with currencies moving around and make sure that we've got initiatives in place I guess to counteract that. But also I mean we will get much more broader on our manufacturing nowadays compared to what we were a decade ago.", "So we have manufacturing in Singapore, for example, it's pretty big, we had some in the U.S. now that we are undertaking. So I guess that portfolio is a little more balanced and then clearly as you know over many years on the material side it was really looked as sort of space or even essentially U.S. dollars to try and mitigate some of that.", "So it certainly has an impact but I guess there is some things we do to try and mitigate that and we've just a got to live with the currency whichever way it goes.", "Steve Wheen", "Okay. And just with the tax changes one of the problems as you've identified is some of the repatriation in historically and now that that's some of those barriers have been somewhat removed. Is this the opportunity that you're talking to of actually capital management initiatives is that sort of the first, sort of cap off the rank with regards to what you'll be able to do now that you can shift that cash around a little bit more freely.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, I mean, we certainly have the flexibility now. I guess with the reviewing that's kind of I wouldn\u2019t want to sort of preempt anything just yet but it does give us that flexibility. The clear will be around being able to utilize that cash essentially anywhere in the world and that could mean growth opportunities, acquisitions, investments where we might want to undertake. We have far more flexibility to do that. And additionally and it's not necessarily either/or, but we would have, I think the ability to do some more capital management as well.", "I mean, there's a few things in the tax reform you've got some limits or caps on interest deductibility and things like that. So you have to navigate a few things but for us it will, it's a great benefit for us because the flexibility is much greater than we had before. And we've kicked off the buyback for example in Q2 we will continue with that at the moment I expect it to be relatively modest or just offset the equity share grants to employees for example just sort of their $1 million to $1.5 million annually. But we certainly have more flexibility around that but not -- we don't have everything completely planned at this stage I think we're just assessing through on our options and so on.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions].", "Your next question comes from the line of David Stanton from CLSA.", "David Stanton", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could explain how Brightree and ResMed are going about increasing mask replenishment and in particularly in the U.S. market. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, look I've been out to often and then maybe Jim can add into that. We have some excellent programs with Brightree Connect and ResMed ReSupply some platforms that we've enhanced and put together to provide an end-to-end service for our HME customers who want to get involved in ReSupply programs.", "We have automatic, email, text, interactive voice response that we can provide to our customers to go directly to their patients. We have dropship programs where we can dropship directly to the patients if the care companies require that or want that and so many offerings in that and every day we are looking at ways to upgrade our ReSupply programs including in guiding patients with their with their my applications.", "We think that there is an underutilization if you like of patients saying they want to get a clean mask when they need a clean mask because they don't know it's available in the options therefore. They don't know the co-pay, they don't know the timing. So we want to turn that ignorance into education and educate patients that when their mask does start to go up and/or their mask starts to get dirty they can get a new one. And this is a piece of plastic that touches your face for seven hours a night, every night, it needs to be replaced on a regular basis and we think there's an under met need to drive that. Any further detail Jim?", "Jim Hollingshead", "I think the only thing I would add to that is the reason there are two platforms is because Brightree Connect is really designed for our HME customers who are using Brightree as their billing platform and there's many thousands of those, there is also thousands of HMEs that's don't use Brightree as their billing platform and so the ResMed ReSupply platform is really designed to be agnostic of billing since it will be usable by HMEs who are on the Brightree billing platform. In that way the two offers effectively cover the entire market.", "David Stanton", "Thank you. And my follow-up is given your strong numbers in the U.S. in particular I wonder you should give us an updated -- your updated thoughts on U.S. market growth rates and indeed perhaps some European market growth rates as you see them going into 2018. Thank you.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, thanks for the question, David. We look at the global sleep apnea respiratory care market that we play in growing in that mid-to-high-single-digits with devices growing at the mid-single-digits and masks systems growing at the high-single-digits.", "Yes, clearly this quarter we took share in both of those categories. Air Solutions, AirView and the AirSense10 and AirCurve 10 systems themselves helped us gain share in the device side and these new masks not perfectly new now three or four quarters after launch but they're still growing well in the nasal and full face categories with the N20 and the F20.", "And I got you to tell you the AirTouch F20 that full mask has formed a nice little niche for those patients who are very sensitive to their -- to plastic on their face and now have a far more comfortable foam that they can have there. I think the market is in that mid-to-high-single-digits. I think we took share in this last quarter and then we have the capability of taking share over further quarters. But we're also putting 6%, 7% of our revenues into research and development to make sure we have a regular cadence of innovation to bring on the mask front as well as on the software front which we upgrade on a four to six weekly basis with the cloud upgrades.", "Operator", "David Bailey from Macquarie is on line with a question.", "David Bailey", "Yes, good morning. I just had a question on the average selling price decline just highlighted this quarter. It's been an impact over the past few years so I just wondered if you'd willing to characterize the decline you saw in second quarter relative to the industry?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, David we don't, haven't for four years given out ASPs.", "David Bailey", "That\u2019s fine. Thank you very much. And just in relation to currency, you've historically provided an impact on a per share basis in previous quarters just wondering if you're able to provide us with the overall impact of currency on a per share basis for the other second quarter.", "Mick Farrell", "Sure, Brett you want to take that question?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, for this quarter was $0.02 favorable for us, which is really the reflection of the stronger euro. So it was $0.02.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor from Barclays is online with a question.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. So the first question I wanted to ask was around your device growth. It was pretty strong this quarter on a tough comp and curious if you could give us any color on some of the components I know you mentioned that the Air Solutions and AirSense platform continues to grow well. And you talked about vents. Can you talk about the different kind of sub businesses within devices and how each of those are doing?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, thanks for the question, Matt. We don't break out the detail between the sleep devices and the respiratory care devices. But I can breakout by geography that the devices grew globally at 9% on a constant currency basis. In Europe, Asia, and our other markets around the world it was around 5% growth of the devices and in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America groups combined we grew at 12%.", "A way to think about why does that relative growth by geography is the penetration rate all their solutions in the digital health and connected health platforms. The more that we're able to show that data with our customers of managing a fleet of products or managing a fleet of patients within the digital health platform enables them to see the value, reduce their labor costs when they use a ResMed device through at ecosystem their labor costs for setting up sleep apnea therapy go down by up to 59%. So that's a big compelling value proposition that you want to buy ResMed.", "As I said during earlier in the Q&A and during the prepared remarks we have had some success in France of getting differential reimbursement for that and I'd say that's the first geography outside the U.S. that will have now sort of an S-curve of growth if you like of the digital side that allows to bring some of that faster device growth there. But look out our French team are doing an amazing job firstly in market access and talking to the government but also in execution of driving that and we would like to see that continue their in France but also across Western Europe and other markets we participate in.", "Matt Taylor", "Thanks for that. I just had one follow-up for Brett. I think there's a lot of things moving around on the tax line and I was wondering if you could give us some sense for when you're developing these ranges for the second half of fiscal 2018 and 2019? How much of that is still kind of moving around and what are the factors we should think about that could actually move those ranges up or down or moving within the ranges.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, sure. I mean, it is -- I mean all of this is very recent and there's been a lot of activity, so these are all if you like our best estimates going forward given what we know about the draft Australian legislation and also the U.S. tax reforms. So put that guidance out there, which I'm recently confident on but they are estimates. And -- looking forward the impacts it'll just be around geographic mix of income and operations.", "Okay, so as operations evolve in different geographies and that can impact your tax rates typically over time. So that would be kind of longer-term impacts that you might see but on shorter-term I think that's going to be our best estimates with what we know on the legislation which you know is very hot off the press. So clearly, we will generally refine that as we go through the quarters if we need to.", "Operator", "Vic Windeyer from Citi is on line with a question.", "Vic Windeyer", "Hi, just quickly firstly I just wanted to understand the tax. The lower tax that brought non-GAAP back from $1 to $0.83 can you just tell us what would just be?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes in terms of the non essentially I broke down to -- we were forecasting some repatriation which would typically have U.S. tax attributed to it under the new tax reforms which came into forth any repatriation we make is no longer taxed in U.S. So that does in fact impact is favorably FY '18 and that has lowered our tax rate on a non-GAAP basis not having to payback tax in the U.S.", "Vic Windeyer", "Okay, all right, great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just in the respiratory care business I guess the -- end of that second horizon of growth I suppose that when do we sort of expect that that mark through inflection point then we go higher rate of growth out of that business given the large opportunity that resonates some of that back at sort of maybe been on slightly to the point of being modest? So I was just wondering whether you could outline how you see that coming through and the timing on that?", "Mick Farrell", "Yes Vic, it\u2019s Mick here. Look there are the 380 million COPD patients out there, we think somewhere around 10% of them will and should have some type of therapy whether it's non-invasive ventilation, portable oxygen concentrator, and/or life support ventilation. So it\u2019s a huge long-term opportunity but it\u2019s not overnight and it takes a long time. I think a really important factor about that second horizon of growth for us is that the money that can be saved for the healthcare system is huge. These 380 million patients are incredibly expensive for the healthcare system, they come back and back and back again to the emergency room and they get re-hospitalized within 90 days on a very high frequency and when they use our products and we show this in the HOT_HMV study when they use our non-invasive ventilator and they use our oxygen concentrator together, we can reduce hospitalizations by 51%.", "So look like we did with the French government and working with them on telemonitoring and showing the return on investment, we are going country by country, payer by payer in the full profit country insurance markets and showing these data. So it\u2019s not in overnight. ASCO it\u2019s market by market but we see a lot of runway ahead and when we launched the Mobi, we will have another part of the portfolio in there another ResMed brand that is part of the portfolio to add in there. So as you look forward to next couple of fiscal years, you will start to see some good growth out of our respiratory care business.", "Vic Windeyer", "Good. And then just on the tax, for a follow-up, what was the tax be in FY \u201919 Brett, if the Aussie legislation doesn't get through? What is the impact of that particular component there?", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, in the unlikely event it didn't go through then that would likely pull it back to closer, closer to the corner right, so we are saying second half. So yes more like that $0.15, $0.16, $0.17 are if it didn't go through or happen to be delayed or something like that. But I think that's a very low likelihood, I think that's going to parliament in February and I expect that to be passed.", "Operator", "Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities is online with a question.", "Suraj Kalia", "Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. So Brett you mentioned 50 bps negative FX impact. Can you split out the impact because the dollar, the U.S. dollar as we know has depreciated quite a bit against the Euro whether you want to look at it from the beginning of 2017 or even from the beginning of 2018, the Aussie Dollar obviously has strengthened so I understand they are working against each other but is 50 beeps the net impact and if you could kind of give us what happened from a revenue perspective what was the FX impact on the top-line.", "Brett Sandercock", "Yes, the top-line was that kind of grow that grow from a 11% to 13% so that couple percent benefit if you like with the strong euro year-on-year. The 50 basis points I mentioned was sequential that's coming through from Q1 to Q2 and if you look at the kind of Euro sequentially it was relatively flat but all the -- has been kicking up and then we have the impact of one quarter lag. So you've seen that appreciate over that time. That has driven that sequential impact for us.", "Suraj Kalia", "Got it. And Mick one question for you in terms of Brightree can you give us the broad contours of your international strategy? Congrats on a nice quarter.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, thanks Suraj. Brightree really is a U.S. designed and operated software. However we do have software programmers who are in the UK and in other parts of the world, so it is a globally supplied business. We operate in 120 countries, the amazing efficiency that we brought to our U.S homecare customers with Brightree, I wouldn't want to limit to just that country.", "Having said that I don't want to distract the team from the really strong teams level double-digit growth and so they will be focused on that but Suraj it's a good question and one we're looking at and we are looking at other geographies including ones that where we're heavily invested to think can we start some pilot trials and experiments some greatest experiments if you like of taking the Brightree technology to some of the other markets that we do business in. So I guess that's part of our Horizon three strategy that out-of-hospital software expansion you'll see us talk more about that as we go forward.", "Operator", "Tom Godfrey from UBS is online with a question.", "Tom Godfrey", "Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me with regards to the new AirTouch memory foam cushion sort of set up I'm just wondering if you've heard from any of your customers always it's got the 30 day replenishment schedule anything from your customers around pushback from funders just given that increased replacement run rate or are you managing to show enough sort of uplifting compliance or comfort levels, so that funders are happy to increase replacement. Thanks a lot.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead from our global sleep business perspective.", "Jim Hollingshead", "Yes, thanks Tom. I think the most remarkable thing about mask is the patient feedback we receive on it. It's an incredibly comfortable mask and the patient feedback is really almost overwhelmingly positive on it.", "From a funding perspective as we take it as our channel partners we're working with them for them to fully understand the replenishment cycle and what impact that might have depending on what insurance the patient has or what the funding situation is patient by patient. And so we haven't heard any real feedback, any real negative feedback from the market probably about the mask but it\u2019s being put on patients who for whom it's appropriate given there in particular either health insurance situation or they're paying out of pocket or whatever.", "Mick Farrell", "Yes, I mean I'd one to that it's such a comfortable mask that it could be a second line of defense if a patient doesn't tolerate LSR or plastic touching their face, there are people who object to that it interferes with their sleep. Foam is incredibly comfortable it\u2019s what lot mattresses are made out of it feels more like the bedcovers and so it's a great niche that I think goes after those customers who need that and as Jim said it will depend on the insurance and the reimbursement schedule but also depends on that individual patient selection. And if you're able to get a patient compliant versus not compliant the difference is as we showed in those published data a huge for the healthcare system, so they're sort of self evident but obviously we're collecting health economics and market access data while we launch a product like this into all our markets.", "Operator", "We are now at the one hour mark. So I will turn the call back over to Mick Farrell.", "Mick Farrell", "Great thanks Christine. In closing, I want to thank the 6,000 strong ResMed team for their execution on our product launches and their commitment to our operating excellence initiatives. This quarter that work translated into continued market share gains, strong revenue growth, and excellent operating leverage. Our team remains focused on our future pipeline of products and software solutions that change patients' lives and benefit our customers, patients, physicians, payers, and providers. Thank you for your time. And we will talk to you again in 90 days.", "Agnes Lee", "Okay, thank you again for joining us today. If there are any additional questions please feel free to contact me.
